The first thing that was apparent to me was her astonishing storytelling capability, the second is her capacity to pull some deep emotions from me while reading. She gives us a heart-wrenching tale that will affect even the most stoic readers and she does this will a gracefully flowing narrative that will transport her readers from the most exotic of locations to the mundane of everyday life. She makes this happen with the most incredibly unforgettable characters not stopping with the stars of her novel but right on down the line to the most minor of roles. Her main characters are outstanding in their density and Ms. Higgins does an excellent job of making them very real to her audience. They were not only authentic in the roles they played but also very multi-dimensionally faceted in their personalities. She did an excellent job of making them believable and at times frustratingly so. This is not a romance even though there are romantic elements to the story it\u2019s instead a love story about what it really means to be a friend, what it takes to keep that friendship alive and makes those of us who haven\u2019t done that ashamed and looking up names that we have forgotten about along the way of growing up and growing older.Anyone who has ever had a lifelong friendship should not only read this but buy it for that special someone they call friend, every woman who\u2019s ever experienced the whole hearted friend love between herself and another woman should experience this awe inspiring novel. And every man who loves a woman will get a better insight into her should he read this tale. So go out and get this the first \u201cBest Read\u201d of 2011, you won\u2019t be sorry and you will be a better friend if you do.Kudos to you Ms. Higgins for an inspiring, heart warming and very emotional read."}, {"userName": "Shonda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1655614-shonda", "userReview": "4.5 StarsFriends Sarah, Bobbie Jo, \u201cJo\u201d, and Kate are shocked to their core when Rachel, the most daring and vivacious of the group, suddenly dies of cancer. After her passing, each woman receives an unexpected letter from Rachel. In her letters, Rachel requests something of each woman: to experience life outside of her comfort zone.For Kate, that means sky-diving. Kate was spontaneous and care-free before she become a married mom of three. Somewhere along the way her marriage to Paul become routine and stale.Jo is a high-powered business woman aiming for the vice presidency at her company, a position that is so close, she can see the name plate on her office door. Rachel\u2019s request for her is to become her daughter\u2019s legal guardian. And Jo knows absolutely nothing about being anyone\u2019s mother.Rachel\u2019s request of Sarah is to reconnect wtih her one true love. Either Sarah makes it work with him or find closure so she can move on and find love again.The Proper Care and Maintenance of Friendship is a book about taking risks. Leaving what\u2019s comfortable in order to discover the treasures life has to offer. As each woman fulfills Rachel\u2019s requests, she learns valuable lessons about the woman she once was and the woman she has now become. Rachel\u2019s presence is very much felt throughout the book, making her a significant character. I enjoyed how the author used her letters and flashbacks to tell her story. I could vividly picture Rachel as I was reading.I\u2019ve been looking forward to The Proper Care and Maintenance of Friendship since I first heard about it last summer. I\u2019m very pleased to say it was worth the wait.

She has been sent on this \"mission\" by a letter that she received from one of her dear friends Rachel. Rachel has passed away and sent a letter to many of her friends and family with last requests. This book focuses on three of those - Kate's, Jo's and Sarah's. They were brought together by Rachel and the four of them had remained good friends despite their differences. As I stated, Kate was a SAHM then we have Jo - a single workaholic, and Sarah - a nurse who worked overseas in many unpleasant areas. When Rachel dies, unexpectedly to them, but something she was well aware of, she sent each of them letters with one last request. These requests led them on journeys in which they learned to let go and began to hold on. Rachel pushed each one of them to do something they would never have done on their own, which led them to discover things about themselves that they may never have seen. This is a great story about the strength of women's friendships and the bonds that they share. If you are looking for a book for your book club, this would be a good one. There is also a reading group guide available."}, {"userName": "Elphaba J", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355865-elphaba-j", "userReview": "As Cores da Amizade fala-nos de tr\u00eas mulheres e de uma amiga.

It made me feel in a way a bit sad as I would have loved a group of friends like that but as I spent so much time moving around, it just didn't work out. Thank goodness, now though for the internet as I do have a great group of friends online who I can chat to about anything and have a set of good laughs. I enjoyed Lisa's book so much, that I decided to check out what else she had written and came across her earlier book \"The Proper Care and Maintenance of Friendship\". In this book we meet four friends Rachel , Jo, Kate and Sarah - they meet when they were younger and now have moved on with their lives but always stayed close.

Perfect house. Perfect husband. Perfect life. Or so it seems. In her quest to do everything perfectly, to give everything to her children, she has lost herself. Her friends cling to the woman she once was: the woman that was Kate BK (before kids), BM (before marriage). In the spirit of Rachel's sometimes outlandish zeal for extreme sports: Rachel asks Kate to go skydiving. Something Kate had promised she would do with Rachel \"one day.\" Struggling to let go of the image of perfection that envelopes her day to day life, there is very little she can do to control a free fall from an airplane.Jo, the successful career woman. Forever single. Men at the drop of a hat. Or dress. She wholeheartedly believes that the mothering instinct doesn't necessarily come with the boobs, either that or hers are defective. Rachel's request for Jo shocks everyone but no one more than Jo herself.Sarah, forever living in a realm of lost love. Unable to see or feel the love of a man right before her eyes, yet she longs for the love of a man she hasn't seen or talked to in years. Without closure, without answers, she hasn't been able to move on. Her friends are tired of watching her miss out on real love.

I ended up liking it more than anticipated. It\u2019s not life-changing but the writing is sharp and I was pulled into the story immediately.Four women in their late thirties have been best friends since college. One passes away and leaves \u201cinstructions\u201d for the other three. I found her instructions/tasks for Jo downright irresponsible as well as the way these were carried out. So this was either unrealistic or Rachel and her family are not very thoughtful or together people. I did follow this storyline with interest and liked the Jo character. I just found it a little off-putting and it did not endear me to Rachel (the deceased). I also found it odd that all four are knocking on the door of 40 and only one has ever been married, and her not happily. Plenty of people aren\u2019t married at 40 but sheer odds would not place this at 25%. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re divorced or in a long term relationship (or any relationship for that matter). Aside from Kate, at the start of the book everyone in this group is single, never been married, and not in a relationship of any kind. And Kate is married but is vastly unhappy! Really, not one functional relationship in this group? I found this hard to buy and not representative, and I live in an area where people get married much later in life. I realize the author probably had to do this to carry out other plot points but it did not ring true. That said, I enjoyed the story and it was a fast read. Nothing overly poignant but well worth the dollar, and then some."}, {"userName": "Shelleyrae at Book'd Out", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1607230-shelleyrae-at-book-d-out", "userReview": "The Proper Care & Maintenance of Friendship is a heartwarming story of self discovery and second chances. After Rachel's death from cancer, long time friends Jo, Sarah and Kate, each receive a posthumous letter with a last request. Honouring Rachel's dying wishes proves to be a challenge for the women who are forced to confront uncomfortable truths and learn valuable life lessons. Kate is asked to parachute from an airplane and rediscovers her lost zest for life and adventure, Sarah is encouraged to open herself to love, and career driven Jo is given the care of Rachel's greatest treasure, her daughter, Grace. With warmth and humor, Higgins invites us on a journey with these women as they step out side their comfort zone and find courage they never imagined they possessed. The four women, Rachel, Jo, Kate and Sarah are reflections of women we may know, or in fact may be, and as such easy to relate to. Their tasks are not easy for any of them but their doubts and missteps endear you to the characters as much as their triumphs. The friendship which has endured despite their differences, is enviable and Higgins captures the bond wonderfully.The story is emotive, heartbreaking and heartwarming in turn but ultimately is a light, easy read. The plot is fairly predictable for the genre but in a way that is comforting. This is a great choice of book for when you need a little reassurance you are not alone. A celebration of life and love, The Proper Care & Maintenance of Friendship is an enjoyable read and a reminder to live every day as if it is your last."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "Letters, letters, letters...did yours arrive yet?They weren't letters you would want to receive, though. They were letters from Rachel, a dear friend who had died unexpectedly, and contained her last wishes for each friend to carry out. Would you go to great lengths to fulfill a friend's dying wish?Most of the requests were outlandish, but were sent to be sure her friends would find happiness or do something they would never dream of doing. She really wanted all of her friends to improve something in their lives. Of course the friends felt obligated to carry out the requests even though Kate felt hers seemed to be the most daring and Jo argued that what could be worse than the one she received...but then came Sarah's.....all agreed hers seemed the most fun. They also thought that the attorney had mixed up the letters...how could Rachel expect Kate and Jo to complete these requests. Or maybe she knew something they didn't know about what was best for her friends? The book is refreshing, light, and at times a teary read that lets you enjoy some adventures both good and bad with the characters. It also makes you realize that sometimes unexpected circumstances are just what you need even though you don\u2019t think you could even come close to being able to achieve the goal.

For Kate, it is to jump out of a plane and for Jo, it is to look after her daughter, Grace. By following Rachel's last request, the women go on a personal journey and discover the importance of friendship, family, love and respect for themselves.
