They had a shelf of Christmas themed books and I just grabbed a couple of them. I didn't look close at all or I would've noticed it was a novella from a popular book series. It was easy enough to follow along, really didn't need to know the backstory for this one. They caught you up on anything that you might need to know and it was just a simple little mystery. I also missed when I grabbed this one that it was Christian fiction. I didn't find it overly preachy but I did find it overly cheesy. I read it because it was short, but I'd never get through a full book with these characters. It was just all a little too convenient and sweet for me. Lesson from reading this book?

Her sister-in-law, Lauri, suddenly turns up on the doorstep of the lighthouse home Bree shares with her husband, Kade, in Rock Harbor. Secretive and withdrawn, Lauri seems curiously intent on discovering what happened to a parachuter who disappeared in the North Woods along Lake Superior\u2019s icy shore.As Bree and Samson, her search-and-rescue dog, plunge into the search, Bree wonders if Lauri may know more than she\u2019s admitted about the parachuter. And then the clues lead them to the trail of a young woman whose family fears the worst about her disappearance.Will the search on this snowy, silent night lead Bree and Samson to more than clues about the missing girl? And will Bree\u2019s prayer for a baby ever be answered?I made a mistake I have not read the previous five books in this Rock Harbor series, however, it is a mistake I intend to correct. Bree Matthews is search-and-rescue and she has Samson, her specially trained dog to help her. The minute I hear search-and-rescue I immediately feel the immediacy of the moment. Someone is missing, there is trouble involved and there is no time to waste. Colleen Coble knows exactly how to bring all of that to the story and more. Danger, suspense, mystery, a missing parachuter, family troubles and Christmas, \u201cSilent Night\u201d has it all.

And will Bree and Kade get the baby they have been praying for?I must say I have fallen In love with the characters of Rock Harbor. Silent Night has a great storyline with depth and just enough suspense to keep you turning the pages at a rapid pace. It's a short read being a novella but it leaves you wanting more time with the characters of Rock Harbor. And it has not one, but THREE, animals which always enhances the story for me. I loved Bree's German shepherd / chow mix named Samson who went on search and rescue missions with her. Overall I was very pleased with this Rock Harbor novella and if you like short stories with suspense you will too. It can be read as a stand alone but I think after reading it you will want to delve deeper into the series.

It seemed interesting so I thought I'd give it a shot. Listed as Rock Harbor #6 it is a short Christmas novella for the series.I don't know much about the series or the characters. I have to be honest when I'm writing my review. You want me to be honest. I still feel I don't know much about the characters or the series after reading the novella. A novella is shorter than a novel, but this felt really short. We skimmed the surface of every plot, every point in this story. Every point could have been developed really well and really big. I think the whole story would have made a fabulous novel sized book.This story is set at Christmastime, but Christmas plays no role in the story except maybe as an excuse to get certain characters together. For everything that happens the events could take place in the summer, spring, winter, or fall. Not to be harsh, but I feel if it is going to be labeled a Christmas novella Christmas needs to play a part.If you are a fan of Colleen Coble and/or read the Rock Harbor series you will enjoy this book. You will probably wish there was more meat to the story, but you will enjoy it. Good things happen. A surprise. I'm not going to tell you!I will tell you that this story is about Bree and Kade as well as their dog, Samson, getting entangled in a mystery involving someone they think is Laurie's friend.

She's one of my favorite authors and I have read and reviewed many of her books in the past couple of years. This novella was centered around one of my favorite families introduced to us in her Rock Harbor series. Bree and Kade have one son named Davy (from her first marriage) and a search dog named Samson. Kade's parents are deceased and he has one sister Lauri who's been a bit of a handful in recent years but has hopefully got her life on track and will be graduating the following semester with an accounting degree. When Lauri arrives early for Christmas they know something is amiss because classes haven't ended yet. They soon learn there's more to Lauri's visit than meets the eye when the guy she was supposed to meet winds up being found dead after parachuting into the woods. Bree is exhausted and dealing with Lauri seems to be a bit more than she can handle but soon she finds that there's a lot more on their plate than just helping Lauri find out what was really going on with the guy that parachuted into the woods. Their family will never be the same after this Christmas! This novella was a quick read and one that I wished didn't end so soon. If you're a Colleen Coble fan then I encourage you to read this and if she's a new author to you then the Rock Harbor series is a great place to start!I received this book free of charge from Booksneeze in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4859474-carrie", "userReview": "Silent Night is a wonderful novella about family and recognizing what is important in your life. I\u2019ve read a book by Colleen Coble previously Tidewater Inn and I enjoyed it so I thought I would give this a try. To my surprise, familiar characters popped up. Bree and her search-and-rescue dog Samson have an important role in Tidewater. This story takes place a few years previously that that story.Bree is making a life for herself with her new husband and her son from her previous marriage. While she loves her family, she wants nothing more than to have a baby with Kade, her husband. This desire and the grief over losing a child to miscarriage overshadows the happiness of the coming Christmas celebrations.Her feelings are pushed aside by her work when a parachuter goes missing and Bree needs to go with Samson to search. The mystery of why this man was parachuting plus Lauri\u2019s mysterious involvement in the case keeps Bree busy. As the story progresses, Bree uncovers the details of a kidnapped girl and illegal activity while Lauri is given an opportunity to finally grow up and become a responsible adult.This story was short, just a quick novella, and it moved briskly. The plot never lagged and I was pulled into the mystery of the parachuter instantly. I quite enjoyed how Coble wove in Lauri\u2019s story with this mystery and made it the vehicle for her maturing into a responsible young woman instead of a pampered, spoiled princess.A nice easy read that is just right for this time of year, since the plot occurs in the lead up to Christmas.3 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Belindachaplin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183215-belindachaplin", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Colleen Coble's Tidewater Inn so I was happy to read this short novella in time for Christmas. The main characters of Silent Night, Bree and her search-and-rescue dog Samson, also made a cameo in Tidewater Inn, and are featured in the Rock Harbor Series. The story starts just before Christmas in the snowy wonderland of Rock Harbor on Lake Superior's Northern shore. Bree and her husband Kade are mourning their loss due to miscarriage, but looking forward to spending Christmas with their joint family. Kade's sister, Lauri, arrives unexpectedly and it eventually seems to be embroiled in something shady...Bree and Samson get called out to look for a parachutist who has gone missing - and it seems that Lauri knows more about him than she is letting on. Although the parachutist is found dead, the trail also points to the his involvement in an unsolved kidnapping of a young student. I enjoyed this short novel, especially as it was themed for Christmas (and I was reading it around that time!) and as in her books, keeps you in suspense wanting to read more, and leaves you feeling good at the end of the book.

After this initial confrontation; Bree is called out to search with her search dog Samson for a sky diver who did not make his landing.

I also wondered if another case mentioned in the story was part of one of the last novels in the series.

Her books contain realistic places, characters and story lines that are guaranteed to keep you up well past your bedtime while you promise yourself just one more chapter...\"Silent Night\" is one of those stories. A short novella that takes place around Christmastime, this story does not need the reader to have read the other books in the Rock Harbor series to enjoy and connect with the characters. I find it amazing that Colleen can have the reader become so involved within the span of a novella - it takes a gifted writer to accomplish that, and her gift shines with this story.Bree Matthews is a very interesting character who's job is both heartbreaking and rewarding. She is quite realistic with her attitude towards her yearning for a special gift for her husband and her reaction to what he has asked of her. She is a character that I want to get to know much deeper.

I admire authors who can write novellas, with the same depth to their characters, the same suspense and awesome climax we have come to expect from them, in the reduced variation of a short story. Although we return to Bree and Kade, and they feature largely in it, this story is really about Lauri, Kade's irresponsible sister. Join me in learning to know this young woman, who since she lost her parents which she was 15 years old has been rebelling against her brother's guidance. At 21, she has already had a child, who she gave up to loving parents closely connected to Bree and Kade. Now she wants to prove to them that she is maturing. I enjoyed the escape of the book, into the hilly country around Lake Superior, but I loved the way Colleen showed how diligent and seriously Lauri tried to prove herself to her family and friends.
