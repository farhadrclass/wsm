While varied, the stories from the zombie POV are very similar insofar as the personality and thought processes mirror one another to the extent I though they were linked stories (they may well be though it didn\u2019t come across that way). There are some standouts, with \u2018Survivors\u2019 by Joe McKinney reading more like an action romp than survival horror yet it manages to ooze heart amidst the gore infused backdrop. \u2018The Meek\u2019 by Scott Nicholson is probably the best of the collection where cannibalism runs rife in outback Australia and the order of the food chain is severely altered. \u2018The Zombie Survival Scorecard\u2019 by Jonathan Maberry goes to great length to diversify the dead by breaking down the types of zombies and their potential impact on the rate of human survival should such events occur \u2013 interesting and well written. \u2018Murdermouth\u2019 by Scott Nicholson is the best of the zombie POV\u2019s and shows a more human aspect to the walking dead where the living could almost be considered the monsters. Overall this is a solid collection of zombie bits to wet the appetite for a full length.

Don\u2019t let the cover dissuade you. The material varies from great to groaner. It\u2019s a large collection of bits. Worth a read for sure"}, {"userName": "Brandy Hunt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4413558-brandy-hunt", "userReview": "First, this comes across as an excellent anthology. All of the stories are well written with just the right amount of creepy. So why do I only give it three stars?Two reasons: The most important reason is that two of the short stories appear to be rewrites taken from a slightly different point of view, and that POV is from the same zombie.I have enjoyed a few stories that were from the point of view of the zombie, but this combined with the repetition just didn't sit well with me. My understanding is that each story in an anthology should be different.The second is the inclusion of part of a graphic novel script. I'm not going to fault Mr. Nicholson for using this his ebook to promote or ask for contributions for another project. Certainly, I think it's a wonderful idea that I may copy one day. I just don't like how the script format gets mangled by most ebook formats. This is the best I've seen so far, but still, I did not like it.Still very good stories, very good writing. I'll be looking to acquire more from Mr. Nicholson in the future."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4878068-angela", "userReview": "Fun collection of zombie short stories and nice introduction to these authors (Scott Nicholson, Jack Kilborn and Jonathan Maberry) as I've not read anything else by them yet. I really liked the introduction of Murdermouth and the script for a graphic novel. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with reading the panels as they didn't actually show up, just looked like I was reading a play so wasn't distracting at all. Think it must depend on what device you are reading it from."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11130298-jessica", "userReview": "Overall this was a good read especially for the price. I found the two carnival atmosphere themed stories of Murdermouth and Carnival Knowledge to be delightfully (in a horrific way) original. And I got a surprisingly unexpected laugh from the story titled A Matter of Taste. However I was a little disappointed by the Joe McKinney story. It just wasn't as thrilling as some of his other work. Likewise I could have done without the comic... the format just didn't translate well. But overall there are some zombie gems here."}, {"userName": "Blaise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333200-blaise", "userReview": "I like the new take from the zombie's perspective and I like Murdermouth's story quite a bit. It was hard to follow the panels in writing without illustrations but I think the upcoming graphic novel will be excellent."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2008235-jason", "userReview": "A decent collection of shorts, though I'm not overly fond of stories from the zombie point of view."}, {"userName": "Darren Dilnott", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24963189-darren-dilnott", "userReview": "Excellent variety of Zombie tales.
