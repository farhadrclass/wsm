The beauty of the prose in that piece compelled me to seek out a full-length piece in which to immerse myself. Losing Battles, set in the summer of 1930\u2019s Mississippi, grabbed my attention and seemed like the perfect lazy, summer day read. Unfortunately, my June was anything but lazy and I think some day I will re-read this one when I can sit down and absorb the luscious words that really seemed to pop right off the pages of this book. Descriptions like this \u2013 \"They walked through waist-high spires of cypress weed, green as strong poison, where the smell of weed and the heat of sun made equal forces, like foes well matched or sweethearts come together.\" Or, something short and to the point like this \u2013 \"The distant point of the ridge, like the tongue of a calf, put its red lick on the sky.\"When I first finished reading this novel, I was a bit overwhelmed - not because it was difficult to read, but because there were so many stories told through the medium of Granny Vaughn\u2019s ninetieth birthday party. This could have been almost an epic family saga if told over the course of even more pages. Now that a few days have passed and life has settled down a bit, I have been able to sift through all of the stunning passages that I happened to highlight along the way. I now realize what a splendid story Welty created by weaving together all of the strands of Granny\u2019s family history! Granny has one of these sprawling families with which I really have no personal experience. Nevertheless, these multigenerational reunions completely enthrall me when I think about so many brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and cousins coming together to not only celebrate the life of this remarkable matriarch, but also to reminisce about their own accomplishments, longings, hardships and sorrows. Even a few family secrets are revealed \u2013 some of them quite shocking! I thought of this family much as Welty described the magnificent and venerable tree in the yard. \"The tree looked a veteran of all the old blows, a survivor. Old wounds on the main trunk had healed leaving scars as big as tubs or wagon wheels, and where the big lower branches had thrust out, layer under layer of living bark had split on the main trunk in a bloom of splinters, of a red nearly animal-like.\"If you are interested in reading a story with a fast, engaging plot, you won\u2019t really find it here. Not a whole lot actually happens over the span of just a twenty-four or so family reunion/birthday party. What does happen is somewhat stretched out across the course of this 400+ page novel. If you seek superb character development, well you may not be satisfied. If you enjoy old-fashioned storytelling and like to imagine yourself sitting in the thick of a family as each member shares an anecdote or two from their personal lives, then you may very well delight in this. If you savor words that sparkle and nearly come alive on the page, then you should give Welty a try. If you do, I suggest doing so in the manner I wish I had \u2013 on the front porch with an icy cold glass of lemonade or sweet tea at hand and little to no interruptions. Losing Battles rates a 3.5 from me and after some reflection deserves a rounding up to 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "I can't write a proper review of this book because it was too wonderful. I entered this family reunion, stayed until it was over, listened to every story, and found something to love about every single character, even the ones already dead and buried. I had chicken pie and fried chicken, cornbread and watermelon, and lemonade to wash it down. I laughed at old jokes and heard family secrets long buried, played with babies, got my heart broken by old maid aunts with no real home, and marveled at Granny on her 90th birthday. I hated to leave them all, but it was late and time to go.Too wonderful for words, and surpassed \"Delta Wedding\" as my favorite Eudora Welty."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "Eudora Welty weaves a very Southern tale around a Mississippi family who are staging a family reunion that is also a celebration of the family\u2019s oldest member, Granny Vaughn. This felt like going back in time and visiting the world of my childhood. My own extended family had an annual reunion at a small church in the mountains where my father was born, and I have sat through dinners that spread like the food was endless and heard the musings and memories of great-aunts and uncles, aunts and uncles, and cousins that were old enough to be my parents. I laughed, applauded the things that knit these people together, but felt the element of sadness that ran through many of these lives. Even those stories told with humor often dealt with subjects so serious that they altered lives forever.Aside from the story, Eudora Welty might be one of the most beautiful descriptive writers I have ever come across. You could open this book to any random page and lift an amazing passage, which is what I am doing here:The crowd was forming around three sides of the new grave hole. Where Mr. Comfort had been supposed to go was the last grave at the river end of the cemetery. At its back stood only an old cedar trunk, white against gray space. Its bark was sharp folded as linen, it was white as a tablecloth. Wreaths and sprays of spiky florist flowers from Ludlow--gladioli and carnations and ferns--were being stood on their wire frames around the grave, and the homemade offerings--the flower-heads sewn onto box lids and shirt cardboards and the fruit jars and one milk can packed with yard lilies and purple phlox and snow-on-the-mountain--were given room to the side.I was literally standing at the grave and I could feel the respect and emotion that prompted those homemade offerings. Welty treats with some very serious topics during the course of this novel. I wondered about the isolation that could exist in the midst of such a close community, about the lack of justice for some and the miscarriage of punishments for others. I was amazed by the ability this family showed to forgive and accept, and the sense that much of the acceptance arose from the almost fatalistic nature of life in such an environment. This is my first Welty novel. She has been on my reading list for a long time. I will surely read more of her work at the first opportunity."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "I have never been to a family reunion like the one for Granny Vaughn's 90th birthday. Sadly, all my grandparents but one died before I was born and the last died before I was 10. But I've been to numerous Christmas open houses, Thanksgiving get-togethers, family weddings and funerals. And these all give rise to some of what Welty describes in Losing Battles (without the car on the cliff or various animals).Losing Battles is such a warm-hearted, though occasionally biting, story of a large family reunion to celebrate Granny's 90th birthday and the return of her grandson, Jack, from his time away. There are stories told that cause laughter, embarrassment, perhaps a short brawl or strong disagreement. There are secrets revealed, new and old. And there is much food consumed by all. There are babies to be loved by the older people and new family members to be put through their paces. Being new to an old family can be a hard place to live. And there is preaching! Now that is something that never happened at my family events and I loved listening to the Vaughns, the Renfros, and others commenting on this year's preacher who could not live up to last year's--Grandpa. But then I'm a Northern girl who isn't experienced in that sort of preaching. This reunion is separated from me by geography and almost a century, being set in 1930s Mississippi. But I felt I was there from the immediacy of Welty's writing, the beauty of the descriptions of the landscapes, the images she produced of her people. I do recommend this book to all who would like a Southern experience with feeling."}, {"userName": "Ronald Morton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35853560-ronald-morton", "userReview": "The entirety of this book takes place over the course of a two day family reunion (I suppose it's also a birthday party, but the reunion part shines through), there is a hefty amount of present day action, but the majority of the book is composed of family discussions (with many, many participants) or family storytelling (also with many, many participants) which all have this kind of mythifying tall tale feel to them, but the present day action is also kind of over the top where it's difficult to truly ascertain what's been embellished over time, and what is fact. The multiple voices are incredibly well done, and allow for a great variety of stories and tones and personalities to inhabit the book. Much of the book is pretty funny as well, though it intermingles with shades of melancholic nostalgia, and good hearted tenderness.There we go, all five of Eudora Welty's books read in this past week. Some thoughts about that:1. She never wrote the same book twice, not even close. They all have some portion that overlaps with another (more in feel or tone than in any real plot based way) but each is completely distinct.2. The Optimist's Daughter was her best, and I really only see that having read the other four; the skill she brought to that book is really evident viewed through the various skills on display in her other books. It is a massively compressed book, but it's like that because she trimmed away everything but the essence, and yet managed to capture a great deal of complexity at the same time.3. There is a familial gentleness in almost everything she wrote - her books can have teeth at times, but even in that it's because it's what the book or character required, and never feels to be placed out of meanness.4. She could be really damn funny.Still need to read the short stories.

A family reunion and a homecoming serve as a frame for a multitude of stories, some new some told every year, as families do. A young bride is fighting a losing battle trying to separate her husband from his multitudinous family, the husband is fighting losing battles with the town storekeeper, and then there is the car in the tree...settle into her world and be ready to laugh and smile at the absurdities of life.

If you weren\u2019t from \u2018these parts\u2019 and did not understand why a house leaned or a pool held no water, you might also have difficulty with Eudora Welty\u2019s \u201cLosing Battles\u201d.Eudora\u2019s first novel \u2013 written [very late:] after she had long established herself and her readers in that unique prose style of describing language, characters, and human nature in Southern relationships \u2013 is a work with which the author took decades. It is the \u2018Morgana\u2019 theme gathered round a daylong family reunion, also the celebrating of Granny\u2019s 90th birthday. I look upon it as a beautiful benediction given by an author \u2018comfortable in her writer\u2019s skin\u2019; speaking with a slightly fading voice of the images that gave birth to her many most popular pieces. I rate this work low because family strife is not a subject that thrills me, no matter the skill of the writer. I do not suggest for a moment that only those enthralled followers of Eudora\u2019s writings read this novel. I encourage all comers to read all of Eudora\u2019s writings; however, understanding Yazoo clay will be easier than grasping the dialogue and observations in \u201cLosing Battles\u201d. Readers new to Miss Eudora would do best by reading her \u201cPetrified Man\u201d or \u201cWhy I Live at the P.O.\u201d before embarking on this novel."}, {"userName": "Jorge Cienfuegos", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34909029-jorge-cienfuegos", "userReview": "Abandonado un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la mitad del libro.

I'm not from the Deep South, so the speech idioms and rhythms weren't familiar.Once I got into it, I really liked it. In a way it reminded me of Tom Sawyer, in they way that situations arose that were both absurd and believable, though the natural progression of strong characters going about their daily lives. I never laughed out loud while reading it, but I smiled a lot.The whole story takes place during an extended family gathering over a 2-day period in a small rural Mississippi community in the 1930's. People don't have much (or any) money, but they have strength and pride in their community and family.Multiple story lines are running simultaneously, and they include several ongoing feuds (between Methodists and Baptists, between the shopkeeper and Jack, between a woman and her former mentor), minor mysteries (who are the parents of the orphan? what is Uncle Nathan repenting for?), and the central drama: what will happen to the stranded car?I found the book very satisfying, and will be reading more Eudora Welty soon."}, {"userName": "Carol Peters", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33120943-carol-peters", "userReview": "Reading Welty after a long absence, I'm newly astonished at the exquisite phrasing of her language, the believability of her characters gabbing to each other, the lifelike entanglements of her stories, including the main adventure of this novel, getting Judge Moody's Buick back down from Banner Top.

Welty worked on and off again on this novel for fifteen years, with long periods of inactivity to care for her mother and brothers. Unlike her other novels, \"Losing Battles\" is lengthy. When her publisher demanded substantial cuts and edits to the text, Welty took her manuscript elsewhere and had the book published as she wanted it. The novel received great critical and popular acclaim upon publication.The book is set in 1931, the midst of the Depression, in the hills of northeast Mississippi near a town called Banner. The scene for the book is a hardscrabble farm which is the site of a family reunion in celebration of the 90th birthday of the family matriarch, Elvira Jordan Vaughn or \"Granny\". Within the year, Granny's husband had died and her children also are dead. Granny's six living grandchildren (one is deceased) and their spouses attend as do five of Granny's great grandchildren of her granddaughter Beulah and Beulah's husband, Ralph Renfro. Many other guests attend the reunion, some uninvited and by surprise. The major character in the book is Beulah and Ralph's oldest son Jack. Jack had been serving two years at the notorious Parchman prison and escaped one day ahead of his release to attend the reunion. Jack has a young wife, Gloria, who had been teaching school and a two year old baby daughter, Lady May Renfro, who Jack meets for the first time at the reunion and instantly adores.The book consists of a series of short stories told by the family about themeselves and others. The stories are full of detail and recounted in dialogue. The stories develop the many characters and their surroundings intimately and closely. Welty presents these poor characters and their difficult lives unsentimentaly but with love. The reader grows to love them as well. Many interrelated themes appear throughout the book rather than a developed plot. A major theme is Jack returning from Parchman and attempting to establish himself. His wife Gloria, raised in an orphanage and of uncertain parentage, struggles with her feelings for Jack's family. She realizes that much of her life will be devoted to trying to keep Jack out of further trouble. A good deal of the book concerns a character who does not appear, a long-time and rigorous schoolteacher, Julia Mortimer, who characterized herself as Saint George trying to slay the dragon of ignorance in Banner. County Judge Oscar Moody, who had sentenced Jack to Parchman, and his wife Maud Eva also find their way unwillingly to the reunion.I found an exchange of letters between Welty and her longtime friend and editor William Maxwell good in characterizing and understanding \"Losing Battles.\" In a letter to Welty dated August 10, 1969, Maxwell described the book as \"a comic masterpiece\". Maxwell wrote:\" One of the things that moved me particularly is how rich they all are in their poverty. I believed in the poverty, all right, but the effect seemed to be that everybody shone with Everlasting Grace, which they would not have had if they hadn't been so poor. And how they got to be poor -- That series of losing battles -- is also haunting. They are on the way down, so far on the way, that they are also on the way up.... Their troubles are I feel sure as immortal as they are endless. They are in for a long space of being loved by people they can't know anything about, who know everything there is to know, practically, about them. How did you do it?Welty's August 15, 1969 reply to Maxwell also helps understand the novel. After recounting the lengthy period of time it took to write the novel, Welty wrote:\"But more than that (the time) is the reality of that central element in the people that live in rural Mississippi -- it's there to be seen by all -- that character of the relish of life and its tales in the face of poverty and all it's done to them, and, heaven knows, relish of ignorance on some parts along with pride and zest.... I really love these people -- the real ones and the story ones -- even when I sometimes want to shake them and beat them on the head as fellow Mississippians.\"This book is full of Welty's sharp eye for detail, masterful storytelling, and comedy in the pathos of the everyday. With the close detail and full description of short scenes and incidents, the book, in spite of its length, suggests that Welty's gifts were more in the direction of the short story and short novel. Portions of this book drag, although Welty was right to insist on her text without large cuts. Some of the stories lack the subtlety and shades of meaning of Welty's other novels. But the book is easier to read than most of Welty's shorter novels. While rooted in its place, it captures something of the shared experiences of people. With patience, reading this book will be a joy.The quotations from Maxwell and Welty in this review are derived from a collection of the Maxwell-Welty correspondence, \"What there is to Say we have Said\" edited by Suzanne Marrs.Robin Friedman"}, {"userName": "Chris Gager", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager", "userReview": "My edition has 416 pages... The plan for now is to alternate between my \"to read\" list and my awesome collection of rescued books from the town transfer station. This one is from the latter category. Never have read a full novel by Miss Eudora. A few short stories is all. This one's pretty entertaining so far as the author has set for herself the daunting task of setting her story in the midst of an unfolding family reunion. There are so many voices! Apparently there are few if any black people up in the NE hills of Mississippi. Just a lot of poor white farmers. It's the 1930's but I'll bet it's not all that different even today. I suppose they all have televisions but still not much money. EW's approach is considerably lighter than Faulkner or McCarthy but she's every bit as \"regional\" as those two. Calder Willingham and Erskine Caldwell would fall somewhere in between I guess. I wonder if Marilynne Robinson named her character Jack Boughton from \"Home\" and \"Gilead\" as a tribute to this book and it's author? Her Jack is the prodigal while this book's Jack is more Christ-like. One issue for me: everybody at this huge reunion is screaming and yelling at each other. Mostly in good nature but even though I can't literally hear it my brain is getting stressed. Weird... Not the same edition I have which is a paperback from 1978 - Vintage Books. Originally published in 1970. And yes, she starts out with an avalanche of similes. But that lets up after a while.Day two... Not much going on but the hot dry August weather and the neverending parade of colorful characters. Three set pieces so far: the arrival of the relatives, the uncertain fate of Mrs. Judge's Buick and currently the big reunion feast. I think the Reverend is still speaking but everyone's digging in anyway. Mostly it's all a set-up for lots of story-telling and the word-painting of the social, historical, and natural setting. Miss Eudora likes to get into her descriptions of the natural world as much as the human one. Similar to Willa Cather and SE Nebraska. So... is this all just a bit overwrought and overwritten? I guess you could say that. My feeling is that it's important to accept what you're getting and hang in there if at all possible with any book that's a challenge but might seem worthy. This book can be challenging at times. I'm still confused as to the precise physical/geographical relationship between Banner Top and the road. And it does matter(sort of)! There can be so much going on verbally at one time, in one moment, that it's head-scratching. I keep having to go back and re-read s-l-o-w-l-y and mindfully. Even then the details don't always add up. One quote of so many to chose from:\"Uncle Nathan remained standing at Granny's back, his hand on her chair, a fixture there from now on. He had hair streaked with white, tangled and falling to his shoulders. His old coat and pants had been patched again on top of last year's patches and, though neat, had been put on rough-dry. He gave off a steam that spoke of the river and now and then of tar. His face was brown and wrinkled as the meat of a Stuart pecan.\"'You a bachelor?' asked Aunt Cleo.\"(ha-ha... no shit lady)!Sorry to all you Goodreads complainers out there a-raggin' on Miss Eudora but cain't everbody write like that. Funny, and moving...Day three... The supper's about over and the women have gathered to talk with a couple of men allowed. They reminisce about Miss Julia the schoolteacher and how they all resisted her attempts to educate them. At this point one can see some themes coming through. One's about how these people must buy into the whole family system and history. It gives them strength even as it limits the possibilities for their lives. They're proud of resisting Miss Julia's attempts to make their lives better and more \"expanded\". They don't have much regard for her. She's not one of them. We get into Gloria's story, a pretty grim and serious business but again the family emotional environment is somewhat crude and unsympathetic. Strange...Day four... I only read a bit this weekend as I was sports-absorbed(NFL draft). The slow revealing of Miss Julia's story continues as Lexie and the Judge have much to contribute. A cautionary tale about getting old in the company of unsympathetic, closed-minded, emotionally limited (non-family)people. The meaning of the title becomes clearer as it applies to the teacher's life and therefore the author's as well since she was a teacher.Damned computer just lost my final entry...Day five and done... A tough book to rate as it comes in two distinct parts: one is the backwoods slapstick stuff with the car and the other is the serious family story stuff and the stuff about the teacher's life. It's part Faulkner and part \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". By the end it also reminded me of \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" and was the only place I can recall other than \"Outer Dark\" that used the word \"chap\" for \"baby\". 3.75 rounds up to 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Eddie Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1131783-eddie-watkins", "userReview": "A hard book to get into largely because the first page or so contain some of Welty's worst writing (an over-reliance on similes and an overall forced feel) and the next 20 pages intoduce the reader to so many characters so quickly that it's easy to get bogged down. After the rough start it gets quite good, even though not a whole lot happens, as the whole novel covers just a day (or two?) of a massive depression-era family reunion. Not quite the masterpiece Eudora I imagine wanted it to be, but still required reading for fans of hers. It's evocation of a festive dusty hot August day tinged with sadness and strife is unparalleled."}, {"userName": "Tali", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6937197-tali", "userReview": "Esta mujer escribe de maravilla. No es un libro que se lea de un tir\u00f3n pero una vez que estas dentro ya no es f\u00e1cil salir. Los personajes son antol\u00f3gicos, exc\u00e9ntricos y algunas situaciones de lo m\u00e1s disparatadas. Todo ello no exento de humor y de una dureza propia de la vida de los protagonistas pero narrado con sensibilidad, con ternura.

In reality it takes place in the memories, tales, lies and reluctant truths of the extended Vaughn/Renfro family over the last few decades as they have a family reunion. Add to it the farcical elements of a band of misfits trying to get down a car hanging on a tree over a river cliff and you end up with a comic masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Raelene", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/281701-raelene", "userReview": "Welty's prose is unabashedly beautiful, her descriptions lyrical and poetic. And, though the action of this novel occurs over only a day and a half, at a 1930s backwood Mississippi family reunion, you can't come away without a sense of a truly grand epic, a universal human drama, a pattern repeated again and again through the centuries and an appreciation for Welty's genius as a regional writer and a crafter of language."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29131196-mara", "userReview": "\"You can profit from knowing that you needn't be ashamed to crawl-to keep crawling,to be proud to crawl where you can't crawl any further.
