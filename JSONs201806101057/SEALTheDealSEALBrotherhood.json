Seriously this is one emotional roller coaster but lord have mercy it was worth EVERY single tear, laugh and funny look I got while listening to it. LOL Sharon did it again. Made it so I literally could not put this one down. the story itself is full of... well everything. You know the saying, \"Live, Laugh, Love\"? Well that is what this one is all about. The characters become a part of you as you read (or in my case listen) to the words on the page play out. Nick, big strong navy SEAL has had a rough few days. He's not even been home from Afghanistan for 24 hours and gets a call from his sister Sophie. A call he knew was coming but still isn't really ready for. She has cancer and not doing well. It's time to get things in order for her final days. So he and his best friend, and SEAL Team 3 mate head up to her nursery. It becomes a team effort (literally) to get the things done that are needed. His sister though has hatched a plan, her dying wish kind of plan. Sophie wants her little brother and her best friend Devon to be together. So she tells them they must date 5 times before she dies. As if anyone could say no to that. Thing is.. they but heads but they both have Sophie's best interests in mind. They love her and will do anything to give her what she wants. That turns into real feelings being developed. I mean, come on everyone has a soul mate. Sophie knows them both and knew they'd be the right kind of couple together. They manage to deal with the separation when Nick goes back home after taking care of his duties with Sophie's place. But things take a bad turn with Devon and Nick after Sophie passes. Something in Nick breaks. More so than when he is overseas fighting. His sister, the only blood family he had left is gone. Now he's managed to make Devon hate him... and he really has nothing left to live for. When suspicions surface that his sisters health decline could have had help... Nick snaps again. When circumstances present themselves and Nick manages to escape his SEAL team after his sister's funeral and takes it upon himself to exact revenge on his sister's behalf. His ONLY saving grace is Devon. Unbeknownst to her (since she is after her own revenge at the moment on behalf of Sophie) walks in just in time to stop nick from doing something that would ruin him forever. Devon is so mad, at him, at the situation and at the arsehole Nick has in his grasp that she strikes out against Nick. (With a baseball bat.. LOL) She threatens to bash his head in... in that moment she saved him. The way she stood up to him saved him. It removed the cloud from his mind and let him think.. Just as Sophie knew she would, Devon was there when he needed her most.. and then they went to jail together. (I seriously cracked up, ignored the strange looks and just LOL'd.. it was priceless. Reminded me of the breakdown in the cemetery scene of Steel Magnolias where Clary tries to get M'Lynn to slap Ouiser... ROTL. Seriously the BEST moment of the book for timing.)Needless to say Nick now has a second chance to straighten himself up, get his head out of his arse and be the SEAL that his sister would be proud of. Time can heal wounds but so can someone who loves you and gets you.. and for Nick, that's Devon."}, {"userName": "Niki Driscoll", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25918776-niki-driscoll", "userReview": "This was a little different then the other stories about seal team 3. In each of the previous tales the guys continued to project their unflappable control and their actions did not reflect badly on them in their chosen profession. They might have skirted the law to get the job done but they never actually broke their unspoken code. Even though Nick starts the story off with a gold star, his star becomes tarnished and his actions reflect badly on him upholding to the rigid standards that are expected as a member of a seal team. I really wanted to give him a pass as the nature of this story is very emotional and not everyone reacts as you would expect when faced with something that is out of your control plus he is only human. However, given the history that Nick's love interest Devon had ,it was inexcusable. This was a very emotional storyline. My heart hurt, my tears fell and I just genuinely felt bad for the hand that fate had dealt to Nick and his sister Sophie. Once again, Ms. Hamilton portrayed the close community of the seal teams as they come together to help one of their own. Of course anytime you get the guys in one place there is sure to be chaos, fun and a lot of laughter. Despite Nick's conduct, I still thought it was a well written storyline with well developed characters. I liked the added love interest from Nick's seal buddy Mark and his sister Sophie,it was sweet and left you with a good feeling. There are several twists and turns that add excitement, drama, laughter , surprise and some on answered questions. The author did not leave a cliffhanger but I felt that the ending was missing something and did not feel completed. Hopefully the next book will provide the closure I was missing and I can't wait to get started and find out."}, {"userName": "Nicole Caldwell", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16198307-nicole-caldwell", "userReview": "Liked it butttttt....I honestly enjoyed this story. It's not in my top 10, but overall I'd say it was a good book. HOWEVER, where was the apology from Nick?! After what he did to Devon (knowing the issues she's battled from the horrific incident in her past) I expected him to grovel, to feel guilt, to work at regaining her trust, and to prove himself to her. But not once does he even say a simple \"I'm sorry\", in fact the only mention of the 'incident' that left her so shattered at all was when he said he'd never hurt her again (<---- not so sure I'd trust that). Devon apologized repeatedly for minor transgressions early on in the story, she admitted when she was wrong or had made a mistake (despite them all being minor), so to have Nick do something as deplorable as he did and not even apologize is just lame. Liked the story, liked the characters, felt like the ending could have had 4 or 5 additional chapters to tie it off nicely."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13310482-sandra", "userReview": "[ Devon and Nick have sex, when I read the scene, I was positive it was non-consensual, even though later in the book Devon's inner monologue tells us is was consensual (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Eva Millien", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6229658-eva-millien", "userReview": "While helping his sister tie up her final affairs, Navy SEAL Nick Dunn gets more than he bargained for when a deathbed promise turns into a hot affair with his sister\u2019s best friend in this emotionally gripping contemporary romance.

Sometimes this loss can cause one to close up to those who love us.

It doesn't have the same action that the previous stories do, but the emotions and heart put into Nick and Sophie's relationship more than make up for it. It also showed what Team 3 was capable of in the more civilian setting of helping Nick help his ailing sister with her nursery. And Sophie certainly knew that Nick and Devon belonged together. Nick is a very well-rounded hero. He is hot, take-charge, and caring. I found Devon a little lacking as a heroine until the very end of the story, which is the only reason that this book gets four stars. I couldn't relate to her, what I saw as, wishy washy feelings towards Nick. There is a key scene that I would have liked to read played out a different way...Devon DOES come out looking stronger, however I think the way that it played out could have been better for Nick. I know that is ambiguous but I don't want to give too much away.My favorite character in this book is Marc. He is so sweet and caring and I certainly wish that he and Sophie would have met sooner. It was wonderful to read about all of the SEALs that we have met in previous books. I also loved the description of the nursery and Sophie's house. I could see how dilapidated and in need of repair that it was. I could almost smell the soil of the plants...I wanted to go out and get my hands in the dirt after reading it. All in all a good read, but I would have liked Devon better if she would have shown the resolve that she had throughout the book instead of just at the end."}, {"userName": "Conchita", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28342414-conchita", "userReview": "I love this book!
