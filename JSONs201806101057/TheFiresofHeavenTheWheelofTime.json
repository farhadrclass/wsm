Approximately the first third of the novel contains so much recap and repetition that, if I'd had \"my hair in a proper braid,\" I would have been yanking it as often as Nynaeve does.The formula for the first 100 pages or so goes something like this: One or two lines of dialogue, two paragraphs of backstory, another line of dialogue, another couple of paragraphs of backstory... It felt like the proverbial \"one step forward, two steps back!\"I managed to stick with it, though, only because I was listening to it on audiobook (and therefore only half listening while I accomplished something else at the same time) and because I wanted to write a review. Besides, I found it immensely entertaining when I could complete Robert Jordan's sentences for him... <>...In The Fires of Heaven, we never see Perrin or Faile, which is fine with me. There is an interesting plot-line involving Siuan Sanche, Logain, and Gareth Bryne. Rand's adoption of Asmodean is entertaining, too -- I like that we're not really sure which side Asmodean and Lanfear are on. The plot does finally move forward a bit, but it takes way too long to do so. The book could have easily been cut to half its size and been better for it. If I had been the editor, I would have taken a blue pencil to all instances of:* females obsessing about the modesty of their clothing* males obsessing about the modesty of female clothing* needless skirt smoothing and straightening* silk clinging to hips and breasts* shivering or sweating that has nothing to do with the weather* disgusted talk about not understanding the opposite sex* braid pulling, tugging, and yanking* sniffing* thoughts or actual instances of bottoms being switched or spanked* Nynaeve's cat fightsAt this point, I'm quickly loosing patience as The Wheel of Time quickly looses steam. That's a shame, because the story itself is very good -- but it's just too hard to extract it from the dross.Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at Fantasy literature."}, {"userName": "Markus", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26681101-markus", "userReview": "\u201cStorms rumble beyond the horizon, and the fires of heaven purge the earth. There is no salvation without destruction, no hope this side of death.\u201dThe White Tower is shattered by a brutal struggle for power. The remaining Forsaken enter the fray, as kings and queens dance to their tunes in secret. And the greatest army the Westlands have seen in thousands of years emerge from the Waste, as the clans of the Aiel cross the Spine of the World at the command of He Who Comes With The Dawn.The Fires of Heaven is unfortunately not as interesting as previous instalments in the Wheel of Time series. To briefly summarise, there were three hundred pages of following a travelling circus, chapter upon chapter of nothing happening in the Aiel Waste, very little action at all, and quite a lot of talking. And precious little interesting talking, mind you.Still, reading this book was like taking a break after a long and tedious workout session. Its most important strength was that the main characters, previously dubbed the worst characters in fantasy by this particular reviewer, seems to have improved immensely. Rand al'Thor, while further exploring the depths of madness, behaves rather civilly for once; both Egwene and Mat turn into characters I can respect, perhaps even like; Aviendha and Nynaeve have become almost tolerable; and Perrin and Faile don't even appear. So in one way at least, this was a series highlight so far.Min's early POV chapters were great, and so were Rand's late ones. Watching Siuan Sanche race across the countryside with a gentled false Dragon in tow and encountering a bunch of interesting characters was perfectly enjoyable. As was reading about the Aiel and their second crossing of the Spine of the World. So there were certainly great parts included in this book as well.The ending was definitely not as good as the one in The Shadow Rising, but neither would anyone expect it to be. The book as a whole was unremarkable and not particularly impressive, but the (almost) complete lack of negative qualities made me able to appreciate the insane worldbuilding skills of Robert Jordan even more. And for the first time in a while, I'm very much looking forward to reading the next book in this series.Wheel of Time reviews:#1 \nThe Eye of the World\n#2 \nThe Great Hunt\n#3 \nThe Dragon Reborn\n#4 \nThe Shadow Rising\n#5 \nThe Fires of Heaven\n#6 \nLord of Chaos\n#7 \nA Crown of Swords\n#8 \nThe Path of Daggers\n#9 \nWinter's Heart\n#10 \nCrossroads of Twilight\n#11 \nKnife of Dreams\n #12 \nThe Gathering Storm\n#13 \nTowers of Midnight\n#14 \nA Memory of Light"}, {"userName": "Foomy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026111-foomy", "userReview": "What I like to call Volume 1 in the \"Women Hating Men\" trilogy. At almost no point in these three books did women interacting with men consist of anything beyond: insulting men, assaulting men, sniffing at men, or thinking about how stupid men are compared to all the omniscient women. I almost didn't finish this book because of all the negative energy towards men.Lessons I learned from this trilogy.1) It is always a man's fault. Always.2) Women are always smarter than men.3) It is okay to break your promises as long as they were to a man.4) Hitting a man is a perfectly acceptable response to anything he says.5) If a man proves you wrong, it is okay to lie about it and also hit him.6) A man raping a woman is a horrible crime.7) A woman raping a man is funny.8) A man of his word is easy to manipulate.The best part of this whole trilogy was the end of book 6 (Lord of Chaos) because we finally saw some turnabout in the men vs. women thing.Seriously, what kind of women did Robert Jordan have in his life? He was utterly incapable of creating a strong female character without also making her a hateful, spiteful harpy. They are either spineless doormats or unbearable battleaxes. The only reason this one has a second star in its rating is because he actually moves the plot along in interesting ways."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "Another month and another Wheel of Time book down.This is epic high fantasy at its best. Rich engaging world with a lot of different PoVs and exciting happenings everywhere.A few points of interest:Rand - gets his groove on with a special lady and Lanfear looses her mind over it. But he also becomes more of a strong leader everyday.Nynaeve - Unfortunately almost all the female characters in this get a personality change and spend most their time bickering and postering with each other enough to drive me crazy. But she does get to have a battle with Mogadine and that is pretty awesome.Birgetta - The one female character that I loved through this entire book is more in the fight than I ever thought she\u2019d be.Mat - FINALLY DOES SOMETHING\u2026.I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting forever for him to become more than a man that only gambles and chases skirts around. He might try to be hiding from his destiny but it looks like it is going to find him no matter what.Eylane - Tap danced on my very last nerve with her actions towards Thom and some of the other petty crap she pulled. But she has learned to do something that has been lost for millennia so good for her.The White Tower Divided - WOW this seems pretty troublesome overall. All I know is that Moiraine is pretty much the only Aes Sedae I like and the light burn all the others. It is amazing how dense they all are in themselves and their greatness. Hubris will kill them all eventually I think.Min - Was one of the few female characters that didn\u2019t turn into a total ninny this book. I enjoyed her chapters traveling with a deposed Suane the most and I hope she makes it to Rand to have her shot soon.There are some great surprises in this book but I liked the last one just a little more. I think that has a lot to do with all the women in the book becoming silly, whiny and a little stupid for the most part.But the \nWheel weaves as the Wheel Wills\n and I am so caught up in knowing how this cycle will play out."}, {"userName": "Choko", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27962805-choko", "userReview": "*** 4.5 ***A sprint to catch up with the buddy read at BB&B WoT crowd! This is an amazing Epic Fantasy full of excitement, drama, wonderful as well as ridiculous situations, very flawed main characters, and a feeling of enchantment which is almost unattainable for most authors... Robert Jordan has made us already fall in love with all our thick headed leading boys, creatures, and girls, but in this book he tests our patience with them as readers, because he shows how VERY FLAWED they can get. At times I thought all of them needed to get taken down a peg or hundred, or at least they needed a good switching.... Some of them got exactly that, some steel need some direction with a firm hand... But despite the infuriating cat fighting and frustrating stubbornness they all exhibited at times, this is still an amazing, BRILLIANT, and addictive read which should be read by EVERY Fantasy fan!!!!I wish you all Happy Reading and may you find the books which make you feel the way this series makes me feel!!!!"}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "I\u2019ve been reviewing books on goodreads for five years now (has it really been that long!?) and every year since I\u2019ve read a book in this series during the summer months.This is number five and I know a very big adventure is ahead!

But then a battle that had been built up for hundreds of pages wound up mostly happening off camera, so then I was annoyed again!But even if I found some parts dull, the last few chapters more than made up for it, with the most exciting climax since The Great Hunt!So, overall, this was my least favorite of the Wheel of Time books so far, but ultimately still a good read (especially the last quarter of the book).If I were to stack Wheel of Time books in order of favorite to least favorite, this is how it would look so far:I was a little disappointed in myself that it's taken me so long to read through this series so far, but then I noticed something when I turned the books around:Light!

In this book all of the Forsaken plot against The Dragon Reborn practically in broad daylight, high lords and ladies in different kingdoms pursue their own interests - the Dark One be damned, and the troubles in the White Tower split the Aes Sedai into two fractions. The interesting part about the latter is that I counted exactly two (arguably three) full Aes Sedai who try to support The Dragon Reborn with only one of them - Moiraine - being able to actively do it. I will talk about her later.So, what are the major players doing in this book? Mat is the most interesting character in this book, period. Mat is the most interesting character in the series for that matter as well as one of the most interesting characters in fantasy in general. He tries to escape his ta'veren pull only to end up as one of the best generals of the realm with a devoted army. Rand still tries to understand Aiel culture, be independent from both Aes Sedai and Wise Ones, and learn something useful from his Forsaken pet while keeping him on a leash. He also has to play the Game of Houses (extremely intricate political maneuvering) with the best of 'em.Perrin is not in the book at all; in fact his name was only briefly mentioned twice. Egwene does not have a POV, but she quickly becomes one of the most arrogant characters in the series, being able to outmatch any Aes Sedai of the Wise One in that department - and this says a lot.Moiraine on the other hand suddenly learned humility - probably the first Aes Sedai who really knows the meaning of the word - and I found that I can really sympathize with her in the book; sadly she does not have a POV either.Nynaeve and Elaine try to escape first from a country torn by a civil war and then from Whitecloaks stronghold. They try to reach the White Tower unaware of the changes in there and the fact that they would be treated like prisoners instead of heroes as the pair hope. To make their life more exciting, they are hunted by remaining known Black Ajah lead by an extremely pissed off Forsaken. Elaine acts sensible and normal for a change; she also does not have a lot of POV in the book. Nynaeve is the reason why some people complain about this book being a little slow at times. I need to explain some things. Nynaeve in the world of dreams shines and nothing she does in there is boring - and some things are outright heroic - but in the real world she still tries to bully everybody into obedience while doing this with a grace of an elephant in a china shop. It works fine as a comic relief, but seems like complete waste of pages if you take it seriously. I also need to point out the she is the only Aes Sedai - I am talking about a very broad definition of this term - who actually helped The Dragon Reborn, and she did it without any hidden agenda. In fact, she mentioned several times that the only two reasons she became Aes Sedai are to help him and to learn healing; I can support and understand both. All in all, this is a solid 5 star book with some very occasional slow - but not boring - pages. Expect major power shifts by the end of it."}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "Like all the rest of the Wheel of Time books this was an enjoyable and engaging read. It was not quite as well paced as the 4th book in the series, but Jordan has a knack for keeping my attention even when not a lot is actually happening. A sure sign of a master storyteller. The biggest shock was that this book did not feature Perrin at all! That left Rand and the pairing of Nynaeve and Elayne as the main POV characters. Luckily that worked out well enough as both story arcs were good. Rand and the Aiel are on the move from Rhuidean. Mostly to save Cairhien from Couladin and his renegade Aiel. Rand also has to deal with attacks from a few of the Forsaken. Nynaeve and Elayne were on the move from Tanchico to Salidar, where they aimed to join up with the rebel Aes Sedai. Along the way the had to dodge Moghidean and the Black Ajah. Their journey was lengthy and while this was not the best book for Nynaeve as a character, she was a little too crazy at times, I did always enjoy her POV segments. Min, Siuan, Mat, Morgase, and Egwene all had supporting roles in the story. I loved the addition of Siuan and Morgase as POV characters. Egwene did not have a lot to do, but I did feel she showed a bit of growth and maturity. Mat was an ass for the majority of the book, but had a few good moments towards the end. This was another highly addictive read. I like the balance between the action and the somewhat weird and crazy humor that Jordan favours. Rating: 4.5 stars. Not quite as awesome as the 4th book, but still great.Audio Note: What to say? Krammer and Reading were as awesome as ever."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/368858-adam", "userReview": "It's funny, because if you read other's reviews of this book, you'll notice that folks start to split into two camps.

The length \u2014 nearing 1,000 pages in the mass-market paperback edition \u2014 wasn\u2019t so much the problem as the character Nynaeve.To this point in the series I\u2019ve been mostly positive about Jordan\u2019s use of women. There\u2019s no disguising the fact that WHEEL OF TIME is heavily inspired by LORD OF THE RINGS, and seeing Jordan correct one of Tolkien\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 the role of women in his stories \u2014 seemed like a solid step. And while some of the male protagonists seemed passive, merely reacting to the world around them rather than making proactive choices, Nynaeve, Egwene and Elayne at times drove the plot, making decisions and bringing the fight to the bad guys.But in this book, Jordan relies more heavily on Nynaeve\u2019s point of view, and that sucks much of the fun from the story. To this point, Nynaeve has mostly been a side character. Surly and grouchy, almost always criticizing the other characters, she has always been portrayed as a good person who\u2019s a bit overbearing and rough around the edges. But spending as much time inside Nynaeve\u2019s head as we do in this book, I came away with almost the opposite impression. She hates almost all of her \u201cfriends.\u201dElayne is a slut because of the clothes she wears, even though Nynaeve is often wearing something similar.Anyone who disagrees with her is a fool.All men are morons, except for Lan.Thom is an old fool.Juilin Sandar wears a silly conical hat (Nynaeve seems obsessed with this damn hat. In every Nynaeve POV chapter, the first thing she ever says about Juilin is that his hat is silly, yellow and conical. She is literally unable to mention Juilin\u2019s name without commenting on how much she hates this hat).It\u2019s exhausting to be around someone this negative, and Nynaeve\u2019s POV dominates this book, making her constant negativity impossible to ignore. In the end, it drains this book of much of its fun. Even some of the plot developments late in the book are overshadowed by Nynaeve\u2019s personality, and that\u2019s too bad because Jordan moves the story forward and takes it to some interesting places. I just wish Nynaeve didn\u2019t have to be in any of those places."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Terrington", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington", "userReview": "In a series as long as The Wheel of Time you get a lot of ups and downs. And my reaction to reading a series changes each time I read it. Where the previous book, number four of fourteen, is one of the greatest in the series, this follow up drops in pace and all around quality. The way I would consider this book is like this:Start (first 200 pages) : slow, very dry and missing that touch of magicMiddle (200-400 pages): picked up the pace but a lot of filler content focusing on politicisingEnd (400 - 900 pages): the crucial elements fell into place, although they took their timeSadly that's probably Robert Jordan's major flaw as a writer. He paces his novels so that everything happens in a rush at the end and the best parts are. His other flaws include writing secondary characters which are too numerous, one dimensional and similar to each other as well as his occasionally poor sentence phrasing. However that all said he is incredibly compulsive as a writer in his Wheel of Time novels.I really don't know what else I should say about this book. In a series of fourteen novels when you've got up to this point as a reader you probably have an idea about whether you want to stop or continue. You're not quite up to 50 percent and you've almost seen all the good novels already. All I will say is that yes these books can be shallow at times, yes they can be generic, yes they can have patches of inane slow writing. However for the most part they are incredibly readable and full of interesting characters and ideas which have fuelled the fantasy genre. People talk about A Game of Thrones being the series which has been most important in continuing fantasy after Tolkien. I respectfully disagree. I would argue that The Wheel of Time and (what I've read of) The Malazan Book of The Fallen series are better works overall and the books that have fuelled interest in fantasy to a greater extent. However that is one opinion and one I'm willing to debate."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11665678-kyle", "userReview": "The Wheel of Time series represents, for me, the perfect example of a guilty pleasure in the world of fantasy.This series is not actually written very well. Robert Jordan was not a very good wordsmith, and he really only knew how to say and describe things one way. His characters are generally unbelievable, and have ridiculous dialogue. The plot is tremendously predictable, and is heavily influenced (close to the point of being unoriginal) by the fantasy works that came before. The whole story is much, much longer than it needs to be and obviously became bigger than Jordan could handle.That being said... I still enjoy these books. I can't rationally explain it, and I've re-read most of them at least a couple times. I shouldn't be so attached to them, yet I'm chained by my own embarrassed desire to periodically dive into the wheel of time. The only explanation I can think of, is that Jordan was a wizard. Not a skillful, subtle, thoughtful wizard; a sneaky, dark, and soul-sucking wizard who has enchanted me by his mediocre writing.Many people despise and look down their nose at these books, and I totally understand that. Many people also love and adore these books, and will forever place The Wheel of Time series upon their list of all-time favorite books. I can understand that impulse too.I realize this review is lacking in helpfulness, but the important thing to take away is this: try these books out. If you hate them, then fine. At least you'll have given them a chance. If you Love them, then great! Good for you, and you have a long, LONG, journey ahead of you filled with something you love.

On my first read Perrin was my favorite character and Nynaeve annoyed me for much of the series.This book had no Perrin in it whatsoever. Probably because much of the last book focused on him. It also had a lot of Nynaeve. In fact I'd probably call her the main protagonist (or possibly co-protagonist with Rand) of this one. She's started her infamous braid tugging. That said, the things I came to appreciate about her later in the series are more apparent to me on my reread and so far I don't find her nearly as I annoying as I recall.I also really like Mat, who became my favorite character at some point later in the series. I'm really enjoying his parts of the early books a lot more on my reread as well. There are some big developments for him and his plot line here, especially at the end.Overall, while not as strong as the first four books of the series, this is another solid entry if you're a fan of the series like I am. If you were struggling with the earlier books, you may struggle with this one more.So far I haven't lost steam on my rearead and plan to continue on with Lord of Chaos at some point.

I've got some pretty mixed feelings about the book. First of all, this is obviously a massive story, and most of what happens here underlines that fact. However, something that detracted from the epic sweep of the proceedings is the way the women are portrayed. For one thing, grown women going around strapping other grown women on the backside? Considering that about half, if not more, of this tome is dedicated to the female characters, there is a lot of that kind of thing going on. Also, most of them are barely indistinguishable from one another (a fact that some other reviewers already mention here). There is a lot of hissing and scratching and generally childish behaviour to be found here, and it eventually annoyed me. These books are pretty long already, but having your patience strained on so many different levels seems unfair.On the other hand, despite the marked absence of Perrin, the bits with Rand and Mat were really good. I'm hitting the long middle of the series now, but I am still invested enough to continue. I am curious to see how things are going to play out, with so many different pieces on the board.

The story takes its time to unfold, so you get to have a full understanding of all the characters and their motivations.This is a must read series for any fan of epic fantasy series!"}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "This is the first Wheel of Time book I haven't enjoyed more than the last. I was hoping the loss of narrative control I'd been warned about would start later for me than book five. It varies from person to person, from all the reviews I've read; some people note a decline starting with this one, others as late as eight, some never (though those are rare, at least in my friends' GR reviews). Even though I ended up enjoying this book more than I enjoyed the first book in the series (which I thought very derivative), it doesn't quite live up to the last two. There's just a little bit too much meandering, too much time spent on things that didn't need to be shown, or that were simply uninteresting for the larger narrative. But the strengths aren't quite strong enough to drown out the problems.To be honest, if I didn't know that these problems with pacing will only grow with each book, they would have been completely bearable, perhaps even ignorable. Many stories I love have sections I don't enjoy. But when you know it's just the first sign of symptoms of a larger disease*, they become harder to ignore. *And that disease is called narrative diarrhea. Or wait, actually, wouldn't it be chronic narrative constipation? Things are moving sloooowwwly and nothing is happpppeeenning. Poooop joooookes.Still, for every thing in the book that went on too long (like all the focus on the traveling menagerie, Nynaeve's obsession with people making her wear low-cut dresses, the ceaseless bickering between all the female characters, and men and women being up each other's butts all the time), there was actual plot movement and character development. At the beginning of the book, I was ready to strangle Nynaeve. She is arrogant, stubborn, and willfully blind, like a petulant child that thinks it knows everything. She's also argumentative. It's not a great combination. But something happens about halfway through that humbles her a great deal, and then she is humbled still further. After that, even though it's only the beginning of what will probably be a verrrrry slow process of character evolution, she's much more bearable as she wrestles with her faults. There is also progress for Rand, Mat, Moiraine, and Egwene (though none for Elayne, as Nynaeve takes center stage here) that alleviates some of my concerns with the way things were going for those characters. I still have concerns about Rand, though, and it's hard to tell from Jordan's style if he thinks they are problems, as well. He's too cold and hard and unkind. He has power, but he is not an effective leader, one who inspires trust and loyalty, even if he makes mostly all the right decisions. And yet people follow him. I'm not quite sure yet how I feel about Rand and his many love interests, so I think I'll leave that for a future review. I like his relationship with Aviendha for the most part, but that may just be because I like Aviendha.The main thing that is really starting to bug me, and which stands out much more when things are slow, is the battle of the sexes thing. I am really starting to hate the way Jordan writes his characters. Not only do the sexes constantly bicker with one another and ascribe stupid stereotypes to each other AT ALL TIMES, but he has characters of the same sex doing the same thing. All the women characters are constantly fighting with one another and being petulant. The men proclaim friendship, but you rarely see any evidence of it. I don't understand why Jordan can't just have his fucking male and female characters talk to each other first as individual people and not representatives of some foreign nation with different naughty bits. (STOP CALLING MEN FOOLS AND WOOLHEAD, for example. Like, maybe just fucking explain to Rand why that particular thing he just did was not a good idea instead of namecalling and stomping off?) It's too prevalent not to be the author's fault, as opposed to intentional flaws in his characters.Ultimately, I'm still really intrigued by the larger world and story Jordan created, no matter what his asshole characters are up to, and I know that's what's going to pull me through the sloggy bits to come.[3.5 stars]"}, {"userName": "Mary-Ann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140777-mary-ann", "userReview": "The Fires of Heaven is a seamless continuation of the Wheel of Time Saga. It is most definitely not a stand alone novel, and while certain points are re-explained I think that remembering what happened in the previous novels enriches the ability to predict what will happen, analyze characters actions and thoughts. Including picking up on events that were foreshadowed. While I expected much of what happened and what was revealed, I was not disappointed with the \u2018predictable\u2019. There were things that are put in motion in FoH. That I was desperately hoping for upon finishing even just Eye of the World. It was more that, in knowing what is necessary to defeat the Dark One, that certain thing has to happen. And it was a relief to see more peices of the puzzle fall into place for the Light. ***Spoiler*** The necesity of rand working together with the Aes Sedai, and the split in the tower that will allow this . I knew Rand, from the start was a man with strong values. And the announcement of amnesty at the very end is something that I knew had to happen. I think it will ultimately progress to something born out of necessity , re-establishing the institutions that were in place of the age of legends. I keep getting frustrated with how it is not so clearly obvious to all the characters in the story that, the few men who can channel, and women who can, are going to have to work together very closely against the Shadow. The constant bickering and petty squabbles amount the protagonists, could potentially be as damaging to the side of the Light, as the power struggle between the forsaken could be to the Dark. I am loving the progressive development of the \u2018reluctant hero\u2019 Mat Cauthon. The constant draw back, everytime he tries to run away getting pulled in tighter, and deeper. I do wonder sometimes how clueless everyone was to Moraines behaviour. I suppose they were all too wrapped up to notice that she seemed to know there was little time left. That leads me to Rand\u2019s inability to kill women, even Forsaken. I am hopeful to see more of Perrin in the next novel. I did miss him, much the way I miss a good friend. I don\u2019t think about it all the time, and I enjoy the people that I\u2019m with right now, and they are fab. But once in a while there\u2019s that pang of \u2018wow I miss so-and-so\u2019. getting to know Perrin so much in the previous book connected me enough to hold on and hope I get to see him more in the future.

We used to have ESPN, but it's been cut in favor of another Faux ... I mean Fox ... News screen. There are also several CNNs. It's quite frustrating because neither CNN nor Fox reports the news.It's all theater.Both stations have an obvious formula to grind. Fox's spin will always involve a plot on the left to overtake and corrupt America, followed by an impotent but self-righteous two minutes hate session against NPR or the New York Times.CNN tries harder to actually look like journalism. Aren't they just doing their darnedest to be impartial? Says CNN, \"we're not theater!\" Consider Wolf Blizter's name (and beard), Anderson Cooper's power walk, or Parker and Spitzer's \"arena\" interviews. The thing is, if CNN took out the \"Situation Room\" (somebody really screwed up not naming it the Bat Cave, by the way) or if Fox failed to deliver a \"fair and balanced\" right-wing spin, both stations would lose their audience.Formulas can help writers to gain an audience, but they can also constrain.Some readers that left the \"Wheel of Time\" series did so after reading The Fires of Heaven, the fifth book. And it's not like the formula wasn't obvious before now so much as readers were so caught up in these new cultures and territories that perhaps it was helpful to explore the Aiel waste knowing that we'd get to see some prophecy fulfilled and that Rand would battle a Forsaken villain.In The Fires of Heaven, we leave the Waste to return to previously explored territories. It turns out that yet another Forsaken has hatched a diabolical scheme to take over a country in Randland. This time, it's Andor.There are some memorable scenes here. I've always enjoyed how Mat's battle against Couladin was recalled rather than described live, an approach that trusts my imagination to put the battle together. Nice move. Perhaps the ending of The Fires of Heaven is one of the best of the series, if for no other reason than it introduces one of the most difficult mysteries of the series, one that is as yet unresolved, I believe.There are also some dull points.What's odd, though, is that the formula demands them. If CNN and Fox have taught us anything, it's that you don't mess with \"strong female characters\" and their braids, their bodices, and their cat fighting. So, yes, Nynaeve and Elayne's chapters need to get to the point. Unfortunately, Jordan's formula does not allow him to get to the point.Sure, Nynaeve could stop doing \"you know what,\" but if she did stop, I promise that there would be just as many fans crying out for the Situation Room and two minutes hate against NPR."}, {"userName": "Brian ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30718608-brian", "userReview": "The Wheel of Time weaves complex plots in each book, but the main plot centers on a young country boy named Rand Al\u2019Thor. His friends become intricately involved in the plot, and new characters come to them by attractions of fate, called the Wheel of Time. The Wheel centers on Rand, The Dragon Reborn, a reincarnation of an ancient hero reborn to save the destiny of all things, the eternal wheel of birth and rebirth. Thirteen Forsaken (like gods) break out of enslavement, and a Last Battle will end the story in climax, when the strongest of the forsaken, Baalzamon comes to take all things under his dominion. Rand must stop him. This describes the basic plot, but the subplots introduce and maintain exciting and captivating spiritual and fantastic ideas.  The book continues the series; characters split and journey to destinations. The journeys take long hard roads, as the reading does at times. Robert Jordan relies on summary for most of the book, which lessens the quality in comparison to the previous four. However, the end makes up for the wait, in my opinion. Rand continues changing as he struggles to keep his sanity and learns to rule the nations. He struggles with stress, which makes him cranky and arrogant, quick witted and at times on a coin-edge of insanity. Matt runs from the Wheel as destiny forces him into battle leadership, and ancient strategies and tactics emerge in his mind with memories and foreign languages he shouldn\u2019t know.  Sex recurs repeatedly as a theme, as well as nudity, especially female breasts. This occurred in previous books, including an entire people of topless and tough women on ships. Rand has a sexual encounter but the book remains PG, and this encounter escalates into a Robert Jordan style \u201cYou cheated on me with this other bitch\u201d television program, but the jealous woman happens to be an ancient Aes Sedai (witch) with overwhelming magical powers come to take vengeance and punish the cheaters. Also, Rand gets three or four women waiting to be with him, as well as the psycho-super-terrifying lady, named Lanfear \u2013 so polygamy emerges as a theme also. The story has too many sub-plots and themes and cool things to write in a review without writing too much. Jordan\u2019s masonic background evidences in many ways in this story, and these beliefs set the story for great fantastic work, just as other religious writers have created worlds based on other paradigms.

It\u2019s also pretty long and disjointed, in what I\u2019m going to pretend is a clever meta-commentary on the series itself.Aw yeah. That\u2019s the good shit. That\u2019s the Wheel of Time I remember. Or ..... is it??!?Well, kinda.First off I need to tell a little story. This was the first Wheel of Time book I ever read. You see, back in the day, my Dad used to get random books from the library for me. It was a habit he developed when I was a kid, but it continued (embarrassingly) well into my teens, when I was perfectly capable of picking out on my books Dad, god, you don\u2019t even understand me, I didn\u2019t ask to be born! (My Dad still mostly treats me like I am 10 years old, if you were wondering) One of these random selections was Wheel of Time. Yeah, the old man obviously didn\u2019t put a whole lot of effort into his selections for me. I suspect he just browsed the fantasy section and grabbed things based on the cover. \u201cYeah, this looks good enough for the little nerd\u201d. And that\u2019s how I ended up reading Fires of Heaven, the fifth book in a fantasy series that I had not even heard of before. It was quite an eye-opening experience for 14 year old Brady and made a huge impression on me. I became an instant fan, immediately reading Lord of Chaos before seeking out the previous books in the series. Because of this, that warm happy glow of nostalgia mixed with the delight of discovery, Fires of Heaven was always my sentimental favourite of the series.Twenty years later, I can report that it mostly holds up. Mostly. But Present Day Brady can\u2019t ignore the gaping flaws of this book the way wide-eyed innocent 14 year old Brady did. However, I\u2019ll start with the good.I really like the Aiel. It\u2019d be easy for them to just become one indistinct blur, but I think Jordan does a good job showing different characters and personalities amongst them. Bael, rhuarc, Sulin, all great minor characters. But it\u2019s the Wise Ones in particular that i really dig. Sorilea is just awesome. The Wise Ones are written in a way that they have this innate toughness that makes their behaviour feel far more believable and warranted than many of the other various groups of haughty, manipulative women in the series. And some of that toughness and independence rubbed off on Egwene, and helped to change her into the character I liked so much, a woman who could plausibly be made Amyrlin. Criticisms that they\u2019re just a Fremen ripoff still ring false to me. An undoubted influence? Sure, but no moreso than the French are an inspiration for Cairhien, or the Knights Templar for the Whitecloaks (or the Mongols for the Dothraki, to roam further afield). I feel like the Aiel are Jordan\u2019s most interesting and detailed creation, as far as worldbuilding goes (with the Seanchan coming second), and that alone makes this part of the storyline more enjoyable for me, even when things are slow (and before they begin their march into Cairhien, it\u2019s slow as hell. It\u2019s pretty much just everyone hanging out in Rhuidean while Jordan re-establishes the various relationships and recaps the plot for a hundred pages). So when you take the Aiel and throw them in a massive set-piece battle involving the One Power, hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and Mat being a badass and levelling up, I\u2019m pretty happy. Speaking of Mat, I really like the Band of the Red Hand. Talmanes, Daerid, Nalesean and the others to come are all solid and entertaining minor characters. They never really get to do anything after this book, and the whole Band will kind of just idle in neutral from now until the end of the series, but I still enjoy the concept. Rand is also a more interesting character in Fires, as he begins to deal with the onset of madness, and attempts to transform himself into a colder, harder man. His constant grouchiness becomes wearisome in later books, IIRC, but it\u2019s an interesting development here. Unfortunately, he also begins his habit of naming every Maiden who dies in his service here, which gets old very quickly. Oh, and whoever (I think it was William) pointed out that Rand does (briefly) think back to the woman he murdered in cold blood back in Dragon Reborn was correct! He does make an oblique reference to it, and feels regretful over it. I thought the big battle with the Shaido, or the sneak attack by Lanfear/ \u201cdeath\u201d of Moiriane would be a fine conclusion to this portion of the book, the final showdown with Rahvin feels tacked on. Overall, while it isn\u2019t perfect, but I was never bored or frustrated with this storyline.I also like the Salidar storyline. Sure, Siuan\u2019s constant fish-related sayings are annoying and come across as an affectation, and the Leane stuff is as problematic as all the portrayals of Domani women in the series are. But Min is easily the most likeable of Rand\u2019s three love interests, and I also like Logain a lot. It\u2019s an odd grouping of characters, something else Jordan is good at, throwing various disparate characters together. Siuan is also one of the more believeable political masterminds Jordan presents in the series. She really does seem good at this, as opposed to other characters that Jordan has to tell us are good at this, despite all evidence to the contrary (Forsaken, I am looking in your direction)Speaking of the Forsaken (and this concludes the \u2018good\u2019 portion of the review) in Fires of Heaven it\u2019s Rahvin\u2019s turn to fight and lose to Rand. Rahvin is supposedly \u201chiding\u201d in Andor. And by hiding, I mean drawing an enormous amount of attention upon himself with outlandish behaviour, to such an extent that he may as well change the name of Caemlyn to Rahvin City. You do not seem to be very good at this, Rahvin, even though it is supposedly your whole deal. Jordan kinda also dances around the real implications of Rahvin\u2019s methods, so let\u2019s just get it out there. Rahvin is a serial rapist. He uses the One Power to force himself upon women, and even make them \u201clike\u201d it. It\u2019s gross and disgusting and truly makes Rahvin into a hideous monster, or it would if Jordan ever confronted this head-on. But he never really does, and so instead, Rahvin just comes across as a horny idiot that is truly terrible at ruling \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d. He at least puts up a bit of a fight before Rand takes him out, something many of his compatriots can\u2019t say (lol Belal, remember that loser? Is it just me, or do basically all of the male Forsaken suck? The women seem much more interesting and terrifying than the men.) Also on the Forsaken front, Asmodean get\u2019s himself murdered in a mystery that will only be resolved in the most flippant and offhand manner about 30 books later. Knowing this makes the scene lose all impact on reread.Goddamn is Nynaeve and Elayne\u2019s whole storyline a waste of time. I feel a little bad that I\u2019m always beating up on them, so i went into Fires of Heaven determined to give them a fair shot. And what do they do? JOIN A F$@ING CIRCUS FOR WHAT FELT LIKE 50 GODDAMN CHAPTERS. Do you want to read 200 pages of Nynaeve flirting with a sleazy carny? Well too bad because THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE GETTING. Galad shows up, so that we can be reminded that he is the Most Handsomest Man That Ever Handsomed, though Jordan\u2019s characters can only ever seem to express this in the most basic, innocent and childish way possible. Elayne wears tight pants and walks a tightrope, because who doesn\u2019t want to read about that. Birgitte shows up because there weren\u2019t enough braids in this sideplot, apparently. Oh, and I love Nynaeve\u2019s reasoning for remaining with the circus once she knows for sure that Moghedien knows they are hiding in a circus; \u201cWell, there\u2019s more than one travelling menagerie in the world.\u201d Yes Nynaeve. You know what else there is more than one of? Towns. Villages. Ships. LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE. Oh, but nevermind, Nynaeve and Elayne have dyed their hair. Problem solved. All I really got from all this is that Morghedien is actually spelled Moghedien. Huh. I\u2019m not sure why I suddenly noticed this time, when I never have before. There goes twenty years of spelling and reading that incorrectly (also ... my version is better. So this storyline even ruined the aesthetics of Moghedien\u2019s name)The Nynaeve/Elayne story is the most egregious example yet of the bloat that will soon devour whole novels. But here\u2019s the thing. It not so much the bloat itself that really bothers me. In a weird way, the languid side-plots and excruciating pace are a part of the charm of the Wheel of Time. Even at it\u2019s worst, I generally kinda enjoy spending time in this world (I have a feeling that sentiment will come back to bite me in the ass in a few books time). But it\u2019s the endless repetition that really frustrates me. I appreciate the effort to make each book accessible and help new readers get up to speed (and it obviously worked for me when I first read the series), but it feels like a cut and paste job. Stock phrases and descriptions are used and re-used and re-used again, often within the space of a few pages. Entire chapters are devoured by characters thinking and expressing the same basic information over and over again. I genuinely think the meandering and pointless adventures of Nynaeve and Elayne, or of various other characters, would be much easier to take without all the extra rubbish that goes with it.On the whole, this is the book I\u2019ve enjoyed the most on the reread, but not to the same extent that I once loved it. I can admit that part of that extra star is probably just the rosey glow of nostalgia, and that the signs of the downhill slide the series will soon take are all over the place. But this book is so tied to my overall impression of Wheel of Time that the previous four almost feel like prequels in comparison. So, despite the problems, I\u2019ll stand by my enjoyment of it for the most part. If I ignore the Nynaeve/Elayne sections, there\u2019s a lot to enjoy here; Rand and Egwene become more interesting, Mat becomes cooler, my favourite character in the series so far, Moiraine, gets a heroic send-off, and the series as a whole takes some unexpected turns. Also, there is absolutely no sign of Faile, which is surely worth an extra star."}, {"userName": "Kristal Kitap", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17426447-kristal-kitap", "userReview": "Ne ara bittin\ud83d\ude2d"}, {"userName": "JAIME", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31366847-jaime", "userReview": "BEST.

Why, therefore, did I give this a 4.5* rating? Because I enjoyed being back in this world and once I had remembered where all the characters were and what had been happening to them and so on, I really found myself enjoying the immersion that I got from reading this.In this instalment of the Wheel of Time I would certainly say that there's a large amount of build up. The first half of the book is pretty much all setting the scene and building up for things which happen later on in the the book, but that wasn't a bad thing. Rand Al'Thor is once again the main focus of this story which is good because of course he is a key player and I enjoy seeing the struggles of madness and sanity which he has to face whilst also trying to save the world. However, not only is Rand a key figure, but also Nynaeve and Elayne and Egwene have more major positions and have become a lot more established in their own roles and how they fit in with the storyline. Nynaeve and Elayne face many struggles throughout the course of this book as they attempt to find out what's going on within the Tower and what is really changing in the world around them. They have also managed to draw the attentions of some very nasty people such as one of the Forsaken and this leads to them ending up in all sorts of shenanigans in order to disguise themselves.Egwene. on the other hand, is not with her other young friends, she is in fact very close to Rand at all points of this story and it's interesting to see her perspective on the decisions which he makes and the way that she thinks about him as he changes and becomes the man he is destined to be. She is also training with the Aiel Wise Ones and this is a very interesting aspect for me because of their different customs and the ways that they think of things.One element I was sad about not seeing in this story was Perrin and what is going on with him because although he featured largely in the previous two books in this one he's barely even mentioned let alone us seeing what's happening to him. I felt that that was a shame as I was very much enjoying his storyline before so I hope that in the next book he comes back into it.I did like seeing more of the Forsaken and their plotting and also the Black Ajah. I also liked the discoveries about Darkfriends and the way that they had fitted themselves into the society to hide their true intentions. I think that this is certainly a good book out of all the ones in this series I have read so far and I am looking forward to the rest of the series (even though I have been told that the next 3 are not brilliant). I would say that if you've read the previous books and enjoy them then certainly continuing on is worth doing and I hope that I can get to the next books sooner than I left it between this and the previous one as I am sure being more immersed would help!"}, {"userName": "Alex Ristea", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1669785-alex-ristea", "userReview": "Some say that this is where the series begins to slow down, but to be honest, this book was incredibly important for me because of that, and how it fleshed out the world and connected me to the Wheel of Time.See, I'm a fan of slow world-building and character development, and I recognize this series for what it is. Sure, for smaller trilogies and stand-alone novels, you need a faster plot\u2014don't get me wrong, I quite enjoy that, but I also understand and enjoy this book's pace. Yes, parts of it can seem repetitive, or seem like nothing happens, but I liked getting inside characters' heads and seeing what their thoughts were and reading through their brooding. Story through utter immersion, mmm.I thought that the pace brought me a lot closer to some characters, and their focus and development made me start to like a few again (namely: our protagonist, Rand al'Thor. I actually like him now, since he's finally accepted who he is, and lost the emo broodiness that I had to trudge through the last few books).Jordan's always been good at this, but his use of third-person limited viewpoint really shone through in Fires of Heaven. The characters have found their unique voices, and I always appreciate when a particular scene is seen through the eyes of one person, including their prejudices, experiences, and motives.The women's chapters in this book (Morgase, Siuan, Elayne) were particularly well done, and the few glimpses we got of Mat in all his awesomeness (holy battle commander, Batman!) has me excited for what his story line has coming next.And the bickering between men and women, with the impossibility of understanding one another? So good!Two minor quirks that bugged me are that Jordan likes to drive the same point home over and over again. The one that comes immediately to mind is Nynaeve giving her braid a sharp tug. I really should have started a counter on that one to see how often it comes up... The other is I can't get over how prudey some of the characters are. For the same reason I don't like regency novels, I can't stand it when people go crazy over the sight of ankles and legs.I'll end with how unusual this read is for me, because I'm rushing it a bit. Brandon is coming on his tour, and I want to get as far as I can by then. I've never done such a marathon in the same world\u2014I'd rather take breaks in between with smaller books.Though the complete absorption is fun, and I haven't gotten tired yet!"}, {"userName": "Ivana Azap Feje\u0161", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26844635-ivana-azap-feje", "userReview": "\"Blood and bloody ashes.\" -Mat (I actually say this on a regular basis.)I know that some of them will find me boring for always putting the Met's sentences in my reviews of the books of the Wheel of Time series, but.... :PI\u2019m no lord.
