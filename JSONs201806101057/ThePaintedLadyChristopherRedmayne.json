She scuppers their plans by marrying. One of them, however, is not standing for this, and when her husband is murdered it is up to Christopher Redmayne and Jonathan Bale to find the culprit before an innocent man is executed for a crime he didn't commit.The sixth, and sadly, last of the Christopher Redmayne novels by Edward Marston. He switched to doing only his railway crime novels after this one. Which is a massive disappointment as Christopher Redmayne and Jonathan Bale are the most delightful and unlikely crime fighting duo since Randall and Hopkirk (deceased).Full of glorious restoration period detail and wonderfully colourful characters, including Christopher's dissolute brother Henry. \"The Painted Lady\" is a glorious high note to the series.I still want more. :("}, {"userName": "laninaki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1234686-laninaki", "userReview": "2.5 starsI can't decide if I like Christopher Redmayne or not....and given that he's a pretty big part of the Christopher Redmayne books, that could be a problem. The mystery was predictable, the dialog horrendous (comprised of clipped, short sentences throughout), the character development non-existent (everybody is either pure of thought, or a sinner of the worst kind) and yet, I read the full book and don't feel it was a complete waste of time. I may even give Christopher another try."}, {"userName": "Sportyrod", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25680606-sportyrod", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book and found the historical element quite fascinating. I also enjoyed trying to solve the mystery (unsuccessfully) throughout the book. I couldn't quite relate to the motivation behind some of the characters and thought the detectives could have unravelled some things earlier.

The story is about Araminta Jewell and the 4 men who have formed a passionate attachment to her, a great beauty who wants nothing to do with them. They send her gifts and notes and poems and she wants nothing to do with them. She marries, Sir Martin Culthorpe who loves her more than anything in life and she loves him. It is not a marriage of convenience by a love match.Sir Martin Culthorpe arranges for a wonderful French artist to paint his wifes portrait. Once he starts to paint her he starts to realise he has feelings for her. Not sure what these feelings are he goes to her home one afternoon to see here one more time. The 4 rakes in the meantime have a bet with each other, who can win the Affection of Araminta Jewell, they do not feel the marriage has been consummated so they carry on trying to get her in to their bed. But one of them wants more, he wants to possess her.Unfortunatly our 4 rakes do not believe they are out of the picture, they believe that she is still chaste and they want her maidenhood. The 4 rakes today would be called stalkers and the courts would be involved in trying to keep the men away from the woman. The way they continually send her notes and gifts they bombard her with their attention they believe they have the right to be the one to get this woman into bed and that she would fall in love with them she only has to fall for their blandishments.On of the men who has feeling for Araminta takes steps to get rid of the one person standing in the way of Araminta being his. MurderA Very clever look at the way the 17th century looked on women as objects to be owned. The men where the ones to make all the decisions and women would just fall at their feet and do as they where told. I know that even into our enlightened times there are still some men who feel that it is their right to own the woman. But fortunately they few and far between, but here the book is based in an era where a woman has little or no say over her life. Even our happily married Constable and his wife, If she oversteps the bounds set by her husband he knocks her back, maybe not in a really nasty way but she is still to stay within the bounds set for the woman in the 17th Century.We also look at the murder with a police force that is very hit and miss, some of the constables being very dedicated to the job and like our constable able to look at the case and clues and follow them to the truth, and the others who patrol only to the nearest pub and go in.I really enjoyed the book and look fwd to the next one"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5192248-matt", "userReview": "A murder mystery set in restored London after the London Fire, about 1670 called the Parliament House by Edward Marston. This was a quick reead (my favorite) with little bits of historical information spattered here and there, without forcing the history down your throat, and thus admirably able to draw you into the story of Christopher and Susan, how their courting will be effected by the attempt on her father's life and Christopher's brother and his life of hedonistic stupidity.I love historic London, and if I am ever lucky enough to go there, I am sure I will fall in love with the place and have a hard time pulling myself away from it's amazing twisting and turning streets. So this was an easy place for me to fall into and really dig into the story. Now, I am a sucker for a love story, and this story had one in addition to the murder and the attempt on Susan's father. The story moved along at a good pace, had a good number of twists and turns, all the villains got their due coming, and in the end Christopher was able to secure a relationship with the one woman for him. So all in all, a decent book, perhaps not the best I have ever read, and nothing life changing here, but still a worthwhile and enduring story. I definitely recommend this book to lovers of a good historical mystery."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "Narrator..................Glen McCreadyAbr/Unabr...............UnabridgedGenre.......................Crime MysteryAbout The Book - Araminta Jewell is a beauty; a dazzling young lady who manages to resist all the blandishments that come her way.

Set around 1670 after the Great London fire of 1666. Redmayne has been commission to design and build a home for an increasing popular portrait painter who has settled in London from Paris. The painter is arrested for the murder of the husband of the woman he has been commissioned to paint and Redmayne, with the help of his friend Constable Jonathan Bale, sets out to prove the painter innocent and find the real murderer.

Even her marriage to the staid and ugly Sir Martin Culthorpe has not discouraged the rakes of London; for them she has assumed an almost iconic status. Before she wed, a special club had been set up the Society for the Capture of Araminta s Maidenhood with the first man to bed her standing to win a sizeable wager. Though she is now a wife, she is still pursued with unflagging zeal. It is during her first sitting for a portrait painted by the fashionable French artist Jean-Paul Villemot that the architect Christopher Redmayne meets the lovely Lady Culthorpe, although he has heard much about her through his dissipated brother Henry, one of her most ardent pursuers. Before the portrait can be finished and revealed, however, Sir Martin is murdered. Joining forces with Henry and his good friend the puritan Constable Jonathan Bale, Christopher embarks on a quest to discover the killer s identity. But with each new day bringing a fresh batch of suspects, and the matter of whether Sir Martin was killed because of his shady business dealings or for the exquisite prize of his wife still unclear, Christopher knows this will be far from an easy case to crack.REVIEWS \"This is a thoroughly entertaining romp, an easy read with nice pieces of period dialogue, amusing characters and a puzzle to solve.
