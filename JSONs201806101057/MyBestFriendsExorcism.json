I loved the characters and the metaphor of possession (which is not just a metaphor in this story). I loved the references to 1988, and how seamlessly they were dropped into the narrative. It's a supernatural horror story, and the third act drives that home without mercy, but at its core, this is a story about friendship, and I'm glad I read it. I think it would make a great 6 episode series."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Well hell, the end of this book made me cry a little bit! I didn't see that coming! I loved the front and back pages of this book. I took a couple of pictures so you guys could see. It's awesome, like a yearbook =) I loved Abby and Gretchen's friendship. It lasted the test of time. I think something in the book might have went over my head but I'm just going to pretend it didn't. I loved, loved, loved the 80's music references and other stuff. It makes me think of the good ole days. Well, mostly good ole days. This book is about high school, friends and weirdos, demonic stuff, exorcisms ish, troubled families and kids, and probably several more things that I have forgotten. I enjoyed this coming of age story - not your typical coming of age story - but I still enjoyed it. And like I said, the end was both sweet and sad =( Enoy!

I know what drugs are. If you\u2019re really her friend, get her to stop.\u201dandAbby realized that no one was going to do anything. For five years, Gretchen had been the perfect Albermarle student, and the faculty still saw what they were used to seeing - not what was really happening. Maybe they chalked it up to PSAT stress or problems at home. Maybe they figured that tenth grade was a tough transition. Maybe they were caught up in their own divorces and career dramas and problem kids, and if she still wasn\u2019t turning things around on Monday they\u2019d say something. Or maybe the following Monday. Or the Monday after that. Something was changing inside Gretchen. Maybe it was the acid, maybe it was Andy, maybe it was her parents, maybe it was something worse. Whatever it was, Abby had to keep trying. She couldn\u2019t abandon her friend because soon Gretchen would be ready to talk. Any minute now she\u2019d look up from her daybook and say, \u201cI have to tell you something serious.\u201dpages 138-9 - blamed on rape, trauma manifesting in cuttingSo it was true. Someone had been in the woods and attacked Gretchen, and now she was hurting herself again and again as she relived the trauma, punishing herself just like Seventeen said. It all made so much sense that, insanely, Abby felt proud for having figured it out.144 - blamed on unspecified adolescent psychology\u201dWhat Gretchen is going through is very scary, and I don\u2019t blame you for backing off from your friendship a little. But we\u2019ve talked to doctors and they tell us that what\u2019s happening is an unfortunate sickness of the mind and spirit that happens sometimes as girls grow up.\u201dand\u201dIt\u2019s terrible when a young person hurts herself. But it can be a reaction to a lot of things. We\u2019ve found someone in the church who Gretchen can speak to, and that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to start getting better.and the biggest opportunity for an \u201cout\u201d from a supernatural explanation comes from a source who should be above reproach:\u201dAbby,\u201d Father Morgan said, \u201cI know how it is to be a young person. There are all these reports of satanic cults everywhere, sacrificing babies. Geraldo Rivera\u2019s doing a two-hour special on them next week. Of course you feel these things deeply, and they upset and influence you. But they\u2019re not real.\u201d\u201cThen what are they?\u201d Abby asked.\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026\u201d Father Morgan waved one hand around in the air. \u201c\u2026metaphors. Ways of dealing with information and emotions. Adolescence is a complicated time, and some really bright people think that when the adult emerges, it\u2019s like you\u2019re being taken over by a different person. Almost like being possessed. Sometimes parents, or friends, get hurt when a loved one changes. They look around for something to blame. Music, movies, satanism.\u201dHe leaned back and flashed a smile.\u201cSo you think Gretchen is possessed?\u201d Abby asked. \u201cLike she has a demon inside of her?\u201dHis smile flicked off.\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a metaphor.\u201doh, where was this authoritative voice of reason in the wayback? or was tipper gore just so loud in castigating ozzy osbourne, cyndi lauper and jello biafra that no one could hear? or is it, as poor father morgan later tries to explain to the very stubborn abby, that society needs a scapegoat to explain the bad things that happen, we need someone to be sick so we don\u2019t have to address ourselves, and a media circus is a wonderful distraction. so, that was all a lot of words going nowhere, i know - but again - this is pretty much just for me to figure some shit out. and here\u2019s more of that.hand in hand with the panoply of reasonable natural-world explanations in terms of how it serves the author and manipulates the reader is what i\u2019m calling the stepback. usually, this happens in a first-person narrative, when you have gone along with the narrator for the bulk of the story, and whether or not you agree with/approve of their choices and actions, you are nonetheless firmly lodged in that perspective and then suddenly the book takes a giant step back into third person, showing you the scene in a more objective way, and it\u2019s all \u201chey now!\u201d the two i can think of right now are American Psycho and And the Ass Saw the Angel, but i know there are more. this one has two stepbacks, of a sort, where the choice easily could have been made to move away from the demonic angle and go down an equally creepy but more real-world path. OR to kinda juggle both. they both revolve the exorcist character, and again - A Head Full of Ghosts does a wicked thorough job examining the problematic, gendered and highly sexualized nature of exorcism rituals, but this book seems to be satisfied with setting up and calling attention to a sinister possibility without taking it any further. abby and the exorcist meet at the mall, and after a candid and unvarnished discussion about ghb as a means of knocking out and then kidnapping her best friend, for her own good, of course - praise jesus, this enormous bodybuilder of a man, no more than a stranger to abby, says: \u201dCome on\u2026I want to show you something in my car.\u201dabby\u2019s no dummy, and she\u2019s cautious enough to work out an escape route as she follows him to his white van (natch), where he triumphantly shows off his nylon straps, handcuffs, a straitjacket, duct tape, ball gags, chains, collars, a leash and muzzle, a leather hood, shackles followed by this not at all indicative of a crazy person scene:\u201dIt\u2019s for our safety, of course,\u201d he said. And then he laughed and clapped his hands. \u201cHot darn, I\u2019m excited,\u201d he said, hopping from one foot to the other.\u201din a different book, this goes a different way, right? and i kind of wanted to read that book - a sharp twist away from my expectations, rattling reader-me from my ridealong absorption of abby\u2019s belief in demonic possession back onto firmer ground with a turn of events equally \u201cearned\u201d by events thus far. the second stepback, or opportunity to switch gears, comes during the ritual itself, as it should during any physical torture of a teenage girl \u201cfor her own good.\u201d you should take a moment - preferably before you administer the ghb, just to entertain the possibility that you\u2019re reading the signs wrong. just half a mo. i\u2019m not sure what i\u2019m trying to understand by identifying these moments, other than reiterating that this is barely a horror novel, that it goes 3/4 of the way before it is any different from a contemporary YA problem novel, and that i think that\u2019s interesting. you may not. \u201cyou\u201d are probably just an echo of me right now, because i doubt anyone has come this far down the babble spiral with me, but i\u2019m okay with that. and now i will babble some positive responses.i liked so many things in this book - it gets a hundred stars for design. i love the cover of the paperback, but unfortunately it does not include all the yearbook signatures of the hardcover, of which i particularly like abby\u2019s, whose P.S. means one thing before you read the book and one much more specific thing after, and is the part that made me get as close to emotional as i can when reading. and although the 80s music references i was promised were of the #notMY80s variety - all pop music instead of new wave, i have to admit i thoroughly enjoyed the girls\u2019 new lyrics to \"against all odds\" and \"we got the beat.\"and i especially-especially enjoyed the code of the south - that genteel looking away from the inelegant shames of others:In Charleston, the day you become an adult is the day you learn to ignore your neighbor\u2019s drunk driving and focus instead on whether he submitted a paint-color change proposal to the Board of Architectural Review. The day you become an adult is the day you learn that in Charleston, the worse something is, the less attention it receives. this is, by the way, the complete opposite of how we do in new england, which is pretty much exactly like The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible. that ending, tho. completely unexpected and yet absolutely perfect.*************************************3.5 rounded up for ending. word-thoughts to come."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "I\u2019ll admit that I first picked up Grady Hendrix\u2019 2016 novel My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism because of the title and the cover art, but his personable writing and fresh ideas kept me reading until the end.This is about what you would think: a snarky and fun pseudo spoof of an exorcist themed horror / black comedy. BUT \u2013 author Hendrix makes this work because he tells the story with personality and better than average characterization and dialogue. The reader gets to know characters like Abby and Gretchen and we can understand their unique relationship (even when you consider the demon possession and subsequent exorcism).His horror themed speculative fiction is also quite good. Hendrix fills in the gaps with some good backstory and demonology. Devilishly mean HS girls and cliques are elements that most of us can relate to and the \u201cfaith and fitness\u201d show was classic.Also fun is the 80s theme. Yes, I graduated HS in 1987 and so this 1989 graduation story was nostalgic good times. Like Ernest Clines\u2019 brilliant Ready Player One, we can also kick back with some 80s trivia as all of the chapter headings are 80s songs.Better than I expected, this was a lot of fun."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Abby and Gretchen were best friends until they dropped acid at a party. Now, Gretchen's been acting strangely, letting her appearance going to shit, and Abby's worried. But Gretchen will soon give her something to really worry about...After the nirvana that was Paperbacks from Hell: The Twisted History of '70s and '80s Horror Fiction, I had to give Grady Hendrix's fiction a shot.Set during the satanic panic of the 1980s, My Best Friend's Exorcism is the story of the friendship between two girls and the possessing demon that drove a wedge between them. I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't precisely this. It feels more like a Megan Abbott book, a window into the lives of teenage girls than a horror novel. While it's set in the 80s, My Best Friend's Exorcism doesn't beat you over the head with nostalgia. There are musical references but the culture of the time is the main 80s feature imported into the novel. Satanists are everywhere and they'll stop at nothing to take over the world!The inter-girl politics between Abby, Gretchen, and their friends was very well done and believable. I was never at a moment when I thought \"There's clearly a dude writing this.\" The book is compulsively readable. I wolfed it down in four sittings. I would have gotten it in two but people kept wanting to talk to me during my lunch breaks. Fuckers.It felt more like a suspense novel a lot of the time but there were still some horrific moments that I won't go into here. I was telling my wife about one particular incident and she was pretty impressed.It wasn't perfect, however. The editing was a little sloppy. I noticed one character called the wrong name and one instance of someone's wrists and ankles tied to a bed post but with her hands at her sides. Did she suddenly have four arms?Anyway, those minor quibbles aside, I enjoyed My Best Friend's Exorcism quite a bit. I'll be reading more of Grady Hendrix's fiction.

On the other hand, if you want to feel a little nostalgic in the form of chapter titles that are also well-known \u201880s hits, references to Chi-Chi\u2019s fried ice cream, The Thorn Birds, Flowers in the Attic, puka shell necklaces, and on and on while you experience some campy good times, this one might be a winner. The story does drag a bit when it comes to the teen angst and nonsense in lieu of the barfing of pea soup, but eventually readers do get the scene they\u2019ve been waiting the whole book for . . . . \nThis also appears to be marketed as general fiction.

Sure, there were crazy Satanism scares, Geraldo and diet fads but there were also great music videos, Blockbuster stores and a horror book boom to beat all booms. A lot of them were just like this...about young people, influenced by culture and cliques, just trying to fit in.

Like really high. I was a bit disappointed in the end. I wasn't a bad story but it didn't even come close to living up to my expectations. When I first saw this book, I knew that I would have to read it. Demonic possession with heavy dose of 80's references were enough to really grab the attention of this old lady. Unfortunately, despite the wonderful premise I found the book rather underwhelming.Abby and Gretchen have been best friends since grade school. Things go wrong at a high school party when the girls were doing a few drugs. Gretchen gets lost in the woods and is gone for a night and her personality starts to changes. She becomes very mean especially to her friend, Abby. Abby knows that something is wrong but she can't seem to get anyone to listen to her in order to get her friend the help that she needs.I love the 80's. I was a teen in the late 80's and I really was looking forward to a story set in this time period. Unfortunately, the 80's references in this book became a little too much for me. It felt a little forced in some ways and I think it actually ended up being a bit distracting.The characters felt a little flat to me. I never felt any kind of connection to Abby or Gretchen. I also thought that the story dragged at points. There were some really exciting moments but nothing truly scary as I had hoped to find. In the end, this story just never really grabbed me and was just okay. I do think that a lot of readers will enjoy this one a lot. This is the first book by Grady Hendrix that I have read and I would be willing to read his work again in the future.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Quirk Books via NetGalley for the purpose of providing an honest review.Initial ThoughtsThis book wasn't quite what I thought it would be. I really enjoyed all the 80's references as the book got started but eventually it became a little too much...even for someone who loves to walk down memory lane like myself. The story was okay and it did have its exciting moments but there was nothing here that blew me away.

I think it helps that I was born in 1976, so I'm the target audience and I buddy read it with a friend who was also in middle school in the late 80s-high school in the 90s, so you know--the E.T. themed birthday party at the roller skating rink? Yeah. Nailed it.What you're signing up for when you read this book is the general plot of The Exorcist paired with Carrie vibes but lightened up with Hendrix's unique brand of iconic cultural identification/nostalgia that looks a lot like a blender smoothie of Stranger Things, My So Called Life and every 80s sitcom I ever watched---that's what this book *feels* like when you're reading it.If you were born after 1985, you're probably going to miss out on reliving stuff like the scene where Abby and Gretchen get in trouble for singing the lyrics to Like a Virgin and wearing Gretchen's mom's cross necklaces. That was a scene from my own life--I mean, I *am* the MTV generation. I was scandalized by Madonna. I Stayed up late with my parents to watch the premiere video for Micheal Jackson's Thriller when it was an event on network television, I crimped my hair, had a Swatch Watch, wore Esprit Jeans and sprayed myself with Exclamation perfume every morning of eighth grade. But you'll get the basic idea of it if you swap Madonna with Britney Spears or something.So of course, Grady Hendrix was speaking my language this entire book-not one pop culture reference was wasted on me. I especially loved the song title chapter headings and the songs would immediately get locked in my head,\"How can we dance when our earth is turningHow do we sleep while our beds are burningHow can we dance when our earth is turningHow do we sleep while our beds are burning\"I had no clue what these lyrics by Midnight Oil was even about when I was a kid, but I knew every, single word and it was a treasure to recall that when I got to this chapter-and the way the lyrics actually fit so well with what was happening in the story? I mean, it's genius level storytelling in my opinion. However, I don't think this book will alienate any of the younger generation of readers because 80s pop culture is super celebrated and people who can't relate on a personal level, will at least get it on the same level that they get what's going on in Stranger Things, which is wildly popular for all ages, you know? Sure, my 12 year old isn't going to feel it like my husband and I do, but he relates as a kid--kids don't change. All the characters in this book were well developed and easy to relate to for anyone who remembers what it is like to be a pre-teen/teenager.The humor and horror seem in perfect balance. Yes, there are some cringe-worthy moments and yes, they are less scary because of the humor that's blended through out, but for me, that didn't make it any less entertaining. I enjoyed every moment--stand out moments being the climax towards the end and the exorcism stuff--there were some laugh out loud moments (love the Phil Collins mentions in that scene) Ha!Overall, I recommend this book for anyone--not just fans of 80s pop culture (although they would love this!) and not just fans of horror books, but everyone who likes a good story with witty dialog, great characters and a well crafted horror plot, with few laughs.

Nothing will stand in her way as Abby tries to save her friend from the devil, but will their friendship be strong enough to overcome such forces of evil?When I started this book, I honestly didn't know what to expect. A throwback to the 80s? A horror spoof? A young adult book disguised as horror? Thankfully, it was a pleasant surprise. Yes, it feels spoofy at times and has its own sense of humour, but overall it's a really wonderfully touching book. I signed up for an exorcism, but what I really got and loved most about this book was the friendship between Gretchen and Abby. Not only do you get nostalgic for the 80s (an era that I didn't live in - 1989 baby here - and yet I still feel nostalgic for - explain that!), but mostly I felt nostalgic for those childhood friendships you form. There's really nothing like it. They're so pure and honest and you honestly feel like you're gonna be best friends forever.The usual themes and tropes of possession stories are all accounted for and present in this book, but I still feel like Hendrix brings something different and unique to the story. It's a demon possession story, but with heart. I loved that each chapter was named after a song from the 80s, I loved all the cultural references, I loved that Gretchen went through a stage of crimping her hair... we've all been there, even growing up in the 90s - I've been there. There isn't much in terms of horror - some parts are squeamish and unsettling, but it's not going to keep you up at night. But that's not the point of this book.It's a fun read ultimately, but also really sweet. It's heartwarming to see the lengths that Abby will go to in order to save her best friend - she's admirable, courageous, brave, resilient. And I cried at the end. I was not expecting tears, but they came anyway! Throughout the entirety of this book, I was thinking to myself \"Yeah, this is a solid 4 stars\" but that ending... I gotta give the book 4.5 stars out of 5.

You are my reflection and my shadow and I will not let you go. We are bound together forever and ever! Until Halley\u2019s Comet comes around again. I love you dearly and I love you queerly and no demon is bigger than this!\u201d\u2014The moment I saw My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism in the flesh, I knew I wanted it. It\u2019s formatted to look like a high school yearbook, which is honestly such a cool concept. The bright colours on top of the 80s feel of the photographs really sets the tone for this novel. If you are familiar with the work of Grady Hendrix, you know that his earlier novel, Horrorst\u00f6r, is formatted to look like an IKEA catalog. Awesome right? I\u2019m so glad I picked this one up as it was the perfect book to get me out of my recent mini reading slump.--What I LikedThe chapter titles. I mean, I don\u2019t know about you, but 80s music is the best music. Am I right? Each chapter title within this novel was the title of a song from the 80s and I absolutely loved that. Not only were they great song choices, but they were perfect descriptors for the chapter you were about to read.The friendship. Gretchen and Abby have an amazing friendship. They were always there for one another from the beginning to the end. Abby knew something was wrong with Gretchen, only a best friend would, and she always searched for a solution to bring her best friend back to normal. Even when everyone doubted her and started to believe she was insane, she never gave up. That\u2019s true friendship is you ask me.The descriptive visuals. Oh man, there were scenes in this novel that were described so well that they provided the most intense visuals. Honestly, there were certain moments in this novel that would be absolutely PERFECT for a film adaptation. This could easily be adapted into a film with the same vibes as Jennifer\u2019s Body or something along those lines. It definitely has some comedic moments (um, the Lemon brothers?) mixed in with some seriously creepy scenes.--What I Didn\u2019t LikeThe how? It really may have been that I missed this tiny important detail, but how exactly did Gretchen become possessed? I\u2019m a little lost on how this whole story came to be. She ended up lost in the woods and then what? Did some random teenagers preform some sort of ritual with her? For some reason this just wasn\u2019t very clear for me.The fast forward. I\u2019m not sure how much I liked the idea of the time jump at the end of this novel. I kind of wish that we stayed in the time period of Gretchen and Abby throughout high school. I\u2019m happy to know that their friendship went on after that, but I do wish it stuck with a single time period.--It\u2019s no secret that I really enjoyed My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism by Grady Hendrix. A horror story, mixed with a bit of comic relief that takes place in the 1980s? Count me in. I highly recommend checking out this novel!

Enjoy the 80s greatness!--Initial post reading thoughts:I really enjoyed this book! It was entertaining and I could easily see it being adapted into a horror/comedy in the style of Jennifer's Body or something along those lines. The only thing that bothered me slightly was the way in which Gretchen was possessed. Did I miss something? Or was it never really explained?"}, {"userName": "Bentley \u2605 Bookbastion.net", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7971097-bentley-bookbastion-net", "userReview": "See this review and more like it on www.bookbastion.net!_______This was such a unique blend of 80s movie nostalgia, comedy and horror movie tropes. Grady Hendrix's My Best Friend's Exorcism is nothing if not a wonderful ode to all that made horror of the late 80s and early 90s so great. From the chapter titles that are all 80s song titles, to the pages rife with pop culture references from the 1980s, this book is a wonderful tribute to all that made that era so memorable. I was unfortunately born too late to enjoy that decade myself, but I'm a huge fan of basically all the movies and music from that time period, and San Junipero is my life and street cred.Back to the book, as a lifelong fan of horror movies, I remember many a night spent as a kid watching my favorite horror movies from that decade again and again. In many ways, this book transported me back to those days where I discovered horror for the first time, and for that I'm incredibly grateful for it. Not only is Hendrix great at emulating the things that made that era so memorable, he's also a damn funny writer. Make no mistake, this is camp horror at its finest. It's like The Exorcist and the Scary Movie franchise had a baby, and My Best Friend's Exorcism is the resultant child. I found myself laughing way more than I expected, and at humorous jokes that I felt were really well developed and conveyed. As great as I found the nostalgia and the humor, I was a bit let down by the actual horror. I don't know if I've just become jaded by years spent as a horror fan, but aside from one or two really disturbing scenes I found very little of it truly scary. There wasn't enough permanence in the horrific moments for me to really call it horror. One of the things about horror movies and moments that are memorable is that they become horrific because they are moments a character can't come back from, or are irrevocably altered by. Here, it seemed like Hendrix was afraid to take that final, necessary step to solidify the scares. It felt a bit like watching a made for TV afternoon special. It works I suppose for YA horror, and is entertaining in a cursory way, but it didn't have compelling enough moments to make it really memorable like other great horror examples from that era. There also was a question that remained of how exactly Gretchen became possessed in the first place that irked me. Was it drugs that did it, or was it something the character encountered while she was lost in the woods? It's never explained and I think it detracted from the scary. A good possession story needs to have a source, otherwise it just feels like too much convoluted happenstance.On a more positive note, there is a great thematic arc present here about friendship. New friends, old friends, long-lost friends and the power of best friends to overcome even the seemingly insurmountable.The beginning chapters and ending chapters of the book were actually my favorite parts, because of how strongly they developed Abby and Gretchen as characters and the power of their friendship. Hendrix took the time to paint both these characters in such vivid shades that I cared about both of them. Their friendship was the highlight of the novel for me. Fans looking for a dose of nostalgia for Halloween are sure to love this. I'll be keeping an eye out for more offerings from Hendrix in the future! \u2605\u2605\u2605 = 3 out of 5 stars________image taken from my instagram @bookbastion - follow me for more!"}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "\"What an excellent day for an exorcism.\" ~The Exorcist (1973)\n This is an okay book. Fair. Acceptable. But it takes too long to really get humming (I'm all in for foreplay, but Hendrix really pushes the limits to impatience here). More than three-quarters of the novel is essentially an angsty teen, coming-of-age high school drama about a group of girls and their growing pains with each other and with the world around them. It could very well be Gossip Girl or One Tree Hill -- except that one of the main characters might be demonically possessed (instead of merely being a catty bitch). Sometimes it's nigh on impossible to tell the difference. Here's the thing -- this book suffers by comparison to a lot of other things. Nobody writes the mysterious, dark and turbulent interior lives of teenage girls better than Megan Abbott. Seeing Hendrix attempt to do the same thing here as he explores the iron bonds of friendship forged by Abby and Gretchen when they were children pales in execution and gravitas to Ms. Abbott's vast talents with her mighty quill. The demonic possession and exorcism angle is adequately covered -- but again suffers by comparison to 2015's Bram Stoker Award winning A Head Full of Ghosts. And no matter who you are, if you're writing about this subject, your book is always going to be compared to Blatty's classic horror novel The Exorcist and Friedkin's enduring film adaptation of the same name.Hendrix might have thought he was doing something new and clever here by mashing-up a coming-of-age teen drama with the horror tropes of demonic possession stories, but he doesn't quite make it. Some scenes are definitely creepy and unsettling, there just weren't enough of them (too few of them coming too late in the story) to sustain any kind of coiled tension and impending sense of doom in the reader. And boy, is it really hard to write an exorcism scene that chills, rather than have it feel like a spoof out of a Scary Movie sequel, or a daytime soap opera.

The book really stuck in my mind, so my interest was immediately piqued when I found out about the humorously titled My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism. Knowing more now than I did before about Hendrix\u2019s style though, I had a sneaking suspicion that it\u2019ll be a lot more terrifying than the publisher blurb lets on, and that I\u2019ll be getting a lot more than I bargained for.On at least one account, I think I got it right: there\u2019s no doubt that My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism fits squarely in the horror genre, and I also thought it was much creepier and psychologically jarring than the author\u2019s previous novel. The story, ostensibly about friendship and exorcism, follows the lives of two besties named Abby and Gretchen, two teenage girls living in the 80\u2019s who have been inseparable since the fifth grade. One night while staying over another friend\u2019s lake house, the girls experiment with LSD and Gretchen ends up having a bad reaction, running into the nearby forest and disappearing overnight. When Abby finds Gretchen the next morning, she finds her best friend acting different and very strange. Chalking it up to the effects of the drug and the trauma of being lost in the cold and dark, Abby isn\u2019t too concerned, thinking that Gretchen just needs some time in order to get better.But Gretchen doesn\u2019t get better. She starts coming to school looking tired and wan. She stops washing and bathing. Then come the mysterious scars up and down her arm. The bizarre behavior only gets worse as Gretchen starts being nasty to everyone at school and at home, manipulating them towards harmful and destructive habits and driving a wedge between Abby and all her friends. Abby knows deep inside that something is very wrong, and will not accept that the real Gretchen is behind all these cruel acts. However, no one seems to be listening to her, and so it is no surprise either when no one believes Abby when she tells them what she really suspects: that Gretchen is possessed by a demon.It would be accurate to say I had pretty high expectations for this book. The novel\u2019s description is a bit sparse, but owing from my experience with Horrorst\u00f6r, I figured we could be getting another story mixed with humor and horror. In this, I felt like I was a little off the mark. In the end, I didn\u2019t really find it to be all that humorous\u2014darkly or otherwise\u2014but it was definitely horrific. If I had a problem though, it wasn\u2019t because of that. In fact, I loved the horror elements in this book, but, as it so often the case with \u201cexorcism type\u201d stories like these, I simply found the lead-up to the titular main event to be too long, too drawn-out, and way too monotonous.To be fair, Abby and Gretchen\u2019s friendship is meant to be the theme of this story as much as the actual exorcism itself. I really enjoyed this element of the book, reading about the how the two girls met at a roller skating rink and the way they bonded over a shared love of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, teen magazine quizzes, and Phil Collins songs. The 80\u2019s references were plentiful and fun without going overboard, even though most of them probably went over my head. Abby\u2019s devotion to her best friend was also touching, the way she never gave up on Gretchen in spite of the awful things that happened.The bulk of the book, however, felt like it was mostly made up of high school drama. Granted, it\u2019s creepy, disturbing high school drama, but at the end of the day\u2026it\u2019s still high school drama. It takes a long time for the possibility of demon possession to even come up, and until then we have to sit through a whole inventory of the things that go wrong with Gretchen and how she goes about methodically ruining everyone\u2019s lives. For all the good grades she pulls in, Abby can also be a bit dense. No rational person would immediately jump to the conclusion that their best friend who is acting strangely must be possessed, so I don\u2019t blame her for not acting sooner. I do, however, blame her for the really dumb mistakes she makes, in some ways bringing about her own downfall even without the help of Gretchen\u2019s machinations.This book also commits a major pet peeve of mine: Stupid grown-ups. While I don\u2019t think My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism is really a Young Adult novel (or at the very least, I\u2019d exercise discretion before handing this one to a teen, considering its frightening subject and some of the nauseatingly graphic scenes) it features the trope of painting every single adult figure in this story as an incompetent boob. Parents are either emotionally absent or too conservative and narrow-minded to listen to reason, teachers and school staff are condescending and corrupt, and basically every authority figure who should have been in a position of trust (and responsible for supporting a student in need) are either too obtuse or self-important to do their damn jobs. Aside from being very annoying, this stereotypical approach also made everything feel predictable and unconvincing.Don\u2019t get me wrong, because I did enjoy this book; however, I also couldn\u2019t ignore some of the issues that cropped up, and even the final exorcism itself felt a little anti-climactic after all the build-up. It\u2019s probably fair to say I liked this one substantially less than Horrorst\u00f6r. That said though, I certainly wouldn\u2019t dissuade anyone from picking this up, especially if you are a fan of horror. For some, the healthy dose of 80\u2019s nostalgia would also be a nice bonus, plus the \u201cHigh School Yearbook\u201d motif was clever and inventive. The best advice I can give to the prospective reader is to just dive in while keeping in mind the kind of elements Exorcist\u00ad-like stories typically come with, both the positives and the negatives."}, {"userName": "Ashley Daviau", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35915119-ashley-daviau", "userReview": "I wasn't sure what to expect going into this book, I bought it purely because the title really caught my attention.

Some parts were quite funny and actually had me chuckling out loud, something that I definitely wasn't expecting from this book! And then on the other hand, some parts where thoroughly disturbing and raised the hairs on the back of my neck. I think that part with the tapeworm is going to give me nightmares it was so gruesome! And then the exorcism itself was pretty disturbing in some parts too. I really enjoyed the way possession was portrayed as well, it wasn't over the top and completely cliche. It was almost more sinister because it seemed so innocent and like Gretchen was trying to help those that she was really destroying. I think my favourite part of the book though would definitely have to be the story of friendship behind it. Abby truly loves Gretchen and does literally everything in her power to save her despite how bad she ends up looking and the consequences it brings about.

One moment I loved and the next I was bored out of my mind. I did love those 80s pop culture references though! It filled my 80s kid heart with glee!I debated between a rating of three and four on this one for a couple of days so I'm going to settle on a 3.5, this book was just so different than what I thought I was walking into to. I should start by saying that in general I'm not huge on possession stories. I don't find them scary usually and I get bored in most. I got this one because I thought the premise sounded like a Mean Girls/Exorcist hybrid. The cover is a ton of fun (both hardback and paperback) and I saw all the 80s references and I knew I had to at least give a try. I had recently read a fairly mean-spirited book called \"The Merciless\" and I think I went in hoping it would be a better version of that story (because I really enjoyed that one) but it was completely different. I don't know if I would classify this book as horror exactly, I think it falls more under psychological thriller mixed with horror comedy. That's a bit of an odd mix and I don't think it was completely successful in what it was trying to achieve. I would've liked it much better if the author had stuck to either thriller or comedy because it really felt disjointed when it went back and forth between the two. I think it would've gotten a high rating from me if it chose a lane and did it well. The characters were for the most part fine - I didn't feel totally connected to them most of the time but I guess I cared about them enough to finish the book. I did want to slap each character upside their head a few times though. Mean girls in high school is not always enjoyable to read about and I felt like throwing the book a few times out of frustration. The actual exorcism was really lack luster for me till near the end where it took on a much touching/funny moment. There is very little gore and it mostly centers around these girls and their friendship and just how strong it can be and what it can overcome. That part was great - the horror aspect not as much. I won't discourage anyone to read this one, it's so different from a lot of books I'd actually suggest trying it out yourself and seeing what you think of it. I thought it was worth a read but I'll probably just pop in the movie The Exorcistnext time I get an itch for possession."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5928781-melanie", "userReview": "I absolutely adored this novel!

There were a few, but that is expected with any book. I really thought that the book was slow in parts and some of the situations didn't really have a sense of danger. I was really expecting a thorough account of the demonic possession, but the story that I did get was still entertaining. Gretchen's parents really ticked me off and... well... actually all of the adult figures in this book ticked me off. They offer no help and just push people away. I didn't really understand the stance that Gretchen's parents were taking, but I won't spoil anything.Now to the stuff I did like, I really liked the setting and the bond between these two girls. It seemed like I was reading someone's high school experience... except with Satan. I was really expecting this book to be like The Merciless by Danielle Vega in the sense that it is teen girls with Satan and violence, but this book didn't have the violence that the Merciless had. This book relied heavily on emotion, while I did like the scene of the knife and the fingernails in the Merciless, I don't feel that My Best Friend's Exorcism really needed that to stand out. I related to a lot of subject matter in the book (even if I am not from that time period) and some of the stuff still unsettled me without the hardcore violence (egg shake aftermath scene). I really want to talk about the ending, it was so... I don't want to give it away, but I felt something inside when I turned that last page. It was more about the emotion than the possession. That made me feel that this novel had substance that other books seem to lack nowadays. I am really looking forward to whatever Grady Hendrix throws at us next!"}, {"userName": "Peter Monn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26025759-peter-monn", "userReview": "This book was so much more than I\ufe0f ever expected.

The book really gets away from itself in the middle, when what happens to Gretchen starts affecting everyone and everything around it. When I actually got to the exorcism, I was like 60/40 on whether I was actually enjoying this book or not, leaning toward grossed out/disturbed.I still can't decide if it added a ton for me to have the wrap up chapter summarizing the rest of their lives. Really I just feel like the whole story was sort of depressing, and I don't understand the motivations of anyone's parents in this entire book. So - I'm conflicted. Parts of this book were good. Parts were super, super weird. I'm left confused and a little unsatisfied, even though it tied everything up for the most part."}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa", "userReview": "This was exactly what I needed after my last read, which was an incredibly disappointing 1.5 star book. It's the middle of October, and Halloween is edging ever nearer, so picking up My Best Friend's Exorcism seemed like the perfect pick-me-up. And I honestly flew through this book, it was so much fun!The book follows best friends Abby and Gretchen, who have known each other since they were 10. They have grown up together, and are pretty much inseparable, until one night where Gretchen goes missing during a skinny dipping incident at their friend's house. When she turns up in the morning, she is dishevelled and worse for wear. And that's when the strange behaviour starts...This book has so many elements that I love: horror, friendship, pop culture reference, and everything 80s. The book is set mainly in 1988, and yes of course there are references to movies, songs, and other such 80s American things. If you don't like this kind of thing in books, maybe you won't enjoy it, but I felt that nothing felt gratuitous and just thrown in for the sake of it - in my opinion it just added to the sense of time and place. I loved the friendship between Abby and Gretchen, and I really felt Abby's pain at seeing her friend's deterioration. I felt outrage on her part for what was happening to their friendship, and there were some really great horror moments here. One particular image is still horrifyingly seared into my brain. It was maybe a little light on said horror, not really getting going until more than halfway through, but honestly it didn't take me long to get there. Oh, and did I mention that every chapter is the name of a song? I made a playlist while I was reading it, and I'm sure I'm going to listen to it on repeat for quite some time.Yes, the story might not be that original, but I loved the execution of it, and I really felt sucked into Abby's world. It made me want to read all the cheesy 80s horror books and watch all the equally cheesy 80s horror films, and I'm so glad it was there to pick me up when I really needed a wonderfully fun read. And the ending was surprisingly refreshing, realistic, and almost bittersweet in a way. I would thoroughly recommend this book, and I can't wait to get to everything else that Grady Hendrix has written."}, {"userName": "Jessica Woodbury", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury", "userReview": "I thought Hendrix's debut, Horrorstor, was great in theory, had a strong first act, and then didn't live up to its promise. But My Best Friend's Exorcism is much more solid in its setup, structure, and slowly rising tension. It also has a heavy dose of 80's nostalgia. Basically if you grew up watching The Exorcist without your parents' knowledge or permission, you're right in this book's target audience. There's a strong gross-out factor in some parts, but I think there's YA crossover appeal. This is a book about the power of female friendships, and there's a lot of those I've read so far this year that explore both the darkness and the light of what teenage girls can do to one another. This is another entry in that wheelhouse, even if it's more of a traditional horror novel than the others. A fun, quick read that was creepy enough to satisfy but not so scary that I couldn't go to sleep at night."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "I read this with my Fall 2017 YAL class.The year is 1988. Geraldo Rivera\u2019s sensational special on a country in the grip of Satanism has (especially) religious teens and their parents in a frenzy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE0p_...Grady Hendrix\u2019s My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism, I think a YA horror text, is an eighties pop culture feast, in which hardly a sentence can slide by without Phil Collins and Madonna and crimping irons and TCBY. If you lived through the eighties, then you will appreciate that each chapter title is taken from a Top 40 Pop song (\u201cHarden my Heart,\u201d \u201cI Would Die For U,\u201d \u201cAnd She Was\u201d). It\u2019s a book (I think, possibly) meant to be read with a window to google in order to gleefully monitor every reference to the eighties, and 1988 in particular, and horror movies, generally. The cover of my edition of the book has references to Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo, and The Birds, as if you needed the reminders with all the dead birds (Owls, in particular, are in league with Satan, we hear) throughout the book.The story is of besties Abby and Gretchen. In fourth grade, Abby, a(n economic) class lower than Gretchen (and indeed all of the girls at her school that we encounter) throws a birthday party (ET theme) and only Gretchen attends (AND her mother makes her give Abby a Bible for her birthday), and they in time grow to be friends. They get so close that Hendrix almost seems to suggest they might be gay (Some characters accuse them of this, and \u201cI love you dearly, I love you queerly,\u201d Abby suggests at one point), but they\u2019re not, it seems, they are just closer to each other than anyone else, inseparable. Except when that pesky little demon possession happens, which creates problems for them, but hey, only temporarily! They\u2019ll work through any problems, because they are BESTEST friends! In its worst/best moments, it feels like that (and isn\u2019t that the case, with midnight movie kitsch, that the references can be so bad they are good?). Hendrix\u2019s first book, Paperbacks from Hell: The Twisted History of \u201870s and \u201880s Horror Fiction sets the table for his second book, Horrorst\u00f6r (with a bloodbath in an Ikea-like store), and now this YA Horror fiction that recalls Carrie and so many other similar tales from that era. But are any of them as joyfully full of pop culture as Exorcism? The original that we all\u2014including Hendrix\u2014bows down to, The Exorcist (the film, anyway) veers in places toward farce, but then it takes a turn for the truly horrific, and you must believe it, all you cynical failed believers. There IS demon Possession, damn it, and Linda Blair will hold your paralyzed face to the screen and make you believe it! But in the key exorcism scene in Hendrix\u2019s book that you waited the whole book for, Hendrix can\u2019t resist making fun of how tying Gretchen down is a little s/m, and so on. His is pulp fiction that veers more into comedy and kitsch than true horror, imo:\u2022\t\u201cAs Jesus Christ once said: By any means necessary\u201d\u2014The Exorcist, Brother Lemon\u2022\tWe find 23 pounds of tapeworm in Margaret\u2019s stomach (is this horror, or farce, or both?).\u2022\t\u201cSometimes, you know, you have to break a few eggs\u201d\u2014Lemon, when torturing the Devil out of Gretchen before the protesting Abby\u2022\tIn the middle of crisis moments, Abby tends to want to take Seventeen magazine quizzes such as \u201cHow to Tell if Your Best Friend really Likes You\u201d\u2022\tAbby performs the actual exorcism when Brother Lemon is gone by invoking Phil Collins and Madonna, not Jesus Christ (this IS interesting, and reminds me of a demon possession series I am reading, Outcast, where a preacher wants to cast out the devil, and a non-believing friend just wants to expunge negative vibes/spirits from the general populationThere\u2019s some pop culture theorizing re: girls about the adolescent hormonal turn to boys and against parents and religion as a kind of \u201cpossession\u201d that gets cured with the onset of adulthood:\u201dWhat Gretchen is going through is very scary, and I don\u2019t blame you for backing off from your friendship a little. But we\u2019ve talked to doctors and they tell us that what\u2019s happening is an unfortunate sickness of the mind and spirit that happens sometimes as girls grow up.\u201dWhat is it that happens for a few years? And why is it horror usually depicts possession/madness in young girls?I didn\u2019t always love the writing (but hey, Hendrix rebuts, this is pulp fiction, just relax and have fun!), but I have to admit My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcism has its entertaining moments. It takes 1/3 of the book before we even see things go wrong for Gretchen, so it takes its time to turn to horror, and this is good. Bad things happen to \u201cnormal\u201d good kids! And as with most of these stories, it\u2019s all becomes about friendship and gross jerky boys like Wallace and sexual exploration and revenge.You can get a Spotify soundtrack, just designed for this book, to listen to while you read it. But here\u2019s a couple songs to bring you back to that mall-hair era:\u201cWe Got the Beat,\u201d from the GoGos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuJHx...Phil Collins\u2019s \u201cTake Me Home\u201d from No Jacket Required:https://www.google.com/search?client=...Oh, in case you are nostalgic for even bloodier horror, here\u2019s the Scary Priest scene from the original Exorcist film (1973):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V-Ui...3 stars, maybe 3 1/4, which means I liked it."}, {"userName": "Barb (Boxermommyreads)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5549264-barb-boxermommyreads", "userReview": "I need to start off by saying that toward the end of this book, something happens which almost made me stop reading. Now I very rarely get that way, and almost nothing scares me, so those who know me will have an idea what it is. If I had rated this book right after I finished reading it, it may not have garnered more than 2/5, which would have been unfair. So overall, now that some time has passed, I can look at this more objectively.Abby and Gretchen have been best friends since grade school when they bonded during an E.T. themed skating party disaster. As they enter high school, they are now part of a four girl clique which I am still unsure how it happened because in grade school, one of these girls was Abby's nemesis. Anyone, one night the girls experiment with LSD and unbeknownst to them, Gretchen, who ends up missing all night, ends up being possessed by an demon.Possession has always freaked me out a tad bit and probably stems back to my days of watching \"Exorcism\" and driving home alone down an old country road late one one evening. Therefore I knew the premise of \"My Best Friend's Exorcism\" would probably pull me. I also have heard great things about Hendrix so that definitely piqued my curiosity as well. This book did measure up to my expectations. Some of the scenes described were downright terrifying and others were utterly gross and cringe-worthy. Throw in a ton of 80's references, and an exorcism attempt via a Go-Go's song and I honestly can't say many bad things about this book. Except...reference first paragraph. I could have done without the scene-which-will-not-be-described (because I don't want to spoil anyone). It didn't need to be in the book. Yet, I have given some thought and this is a demon we are talking about and demons do horrible things so although I haven't quite forgiven Hendrix, I am giving him a proverbial pass. This is a very good horror read. Just be warned. If you are reading the book and toward the end you think to yourself \"surely he won't go there,\" be warned, he goes there. Of course I will also add that the scene-which-will-not-be-described probably won't really bother a lot of people so I really couldn't let it interfere too much with my overall rating. Also, after reading this book I wonder how many kids I went to high school with were actually possessed? We all know how mean kids are at times and I could see the comparisons....just a thought. If you love horror, the 80's or anything else Hendrix has written, definitely pick this one up."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4538194-alexandra", "userReview": "I was SO not expecting this to be as good as it was. in fact, I wasn't expecting to like it much at all, as I genuinely didn't care for horrorst\u00f6r. but alas. this was WONDERFUL. yes I know it's about an extremely dark and horrifying thing. but my best friend's exorcism was also 80's and campy and full of pop culture references and song titles/lyrics, as well as quite possibly one of the strongest fictional friendships ever??It will probably take me a long time to be able to listen to We Got the Beat and not think of an exorcism lmao this book was deliciously creepy and horrifying and that one scene with Good Dog Max was the absolute worst:(but my best friend's exorcism was also surprisingly HYSTERICAL at times. Brother Lemon meant business with his exorcism ritual, let me tell you :PI had to laugh when he took a break mid exorcism to eat a chicken breast, claiming \"I need to protein-load.\"and when he said stuff like, \"...he's about to feel the boot of the Lord in his ass.
