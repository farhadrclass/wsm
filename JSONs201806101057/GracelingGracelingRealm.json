It has so much going for it. It is original and inventive. I never once caught myself thinking, \"Now, where did I read that before? Oh, right, in the last three books!\" The idea of the graced, their skills and their mismatched eyes; of the seven kingdoms; of the characters themselves. All of them were uniquely Cashore's own. Her prose was clear and lucid, though there were passages that dragged and made me want to skip ahead. So, pacing was occasionally a problem, but not the actual words themselves. I thought it quite notable, especially as a debut. However. Yes, that dreaded however. But before we get to that, a quick disclaimer. I certainly have no say on what Cashore did or did not intend the book to say. I only can say with certainty what I find in the book and I hope you can agree that if, in addition to great writing and engaging stories, one desires one's reading material to have at the very least some simple ethics, it is more than reasonable that some readers will discuss and debate the ethics and social mores that certain features of this book present. Personally, I appreciate being able to discuss something that a book mentions and which allows me to think of it in an entirely different light. I am fully aware that many might feel that this review is biased and unfair, written from a narrow-minded, hidebound mentality. How dare I allow my personal convictions to color my view of a book I read? Especially a fantasy book that clearly takes place in a world that is not this one. But before you comment to let me know that I am a horrible disgrace and disappointment as a human for allowing my personal convictions to color my view of a book that I have read, please take a moment to know that I am not allowing any comments on this review. I had nearly 50 comments on this review and I ultimately chose to delete them when the vitriolic, contemptuous comments kept coming. For those of you whose opinions differed, but who chose to share that contrary opinion with civility and tolerance, I would like once more to extend my sincerest thanks, especially to Ariel and Angie. For the others that commented to agree or say thanks for the review, I hope it helped. So, back to that however. My issue is that firstly, what Po and Katsa have is not love. Infatuation? Certainly. Affection? Sure. But love, \"true love,\" is wanting what is best for the other person and doing whatever one can so that the other is able to move toward the best. Thus, love is at its core sacrificial and giving. What is the purpose of Katsa's and Po's sexual relationship? It is of transient emotional and physical benefit, but how does it benefit them ultimately? I don\u2019t believe that love equals sex, and the book seemed to infer just that.But say she did love him. I'm all for girl power and females don't need a guy to be fulfilled. All for that. I even understand that at that point in Katsa's life she had just claimed her freedom and could not imagine entering any other station of life that would in any way limit or curtail her personal liberty. All well and fine. But then she goes ahead and enters into a physical relationship with a guy because she \"loves\" him, but just can't ever be \"married\" to him because that would limit her sense of self and her own freedom to come and go as she pleased. Granted, the concept of marriage within the confines of that secondary world might differ, it could be a total abnegation of self, but I never got that sense when they talked about marriages in their society. In fact, at its core, marriage (in our world) is a contract of personal commitment between two people, but Katsa, while perhaps legitimately shunning marriage in her world, still has no desire to ever commit to Po in any way. So it would seem that Katsa's issues had way more to do with herself and her own flaws and insecurities than the idea of commitment or even Po. Given his affection for her, he would never have limited her freedom. But flip the coin. What if it was Po who \u201cloved\u201d Katsa, but refused to marry her because then he would not be free? Where he was the one who would take whatever Katsa had to offer, but did not care enough to actually make any sort of commitment to her? That likely would not go over as well. It is strange what a double standard we have in relationships, esp. in a \"feminist\" age. We praise novels that show females as strong, independent individuals, even if that means they are also selfish and controlling, while we quite rightly condemn that sort of behavior in male protagonists. But then not only are we giving a sad view of a \"strong\" woman, as if that is the only way to portray a vibrant and intelligent female, we are also touting a weak and ineffective masculine image that indicates that no male can be resourceful or a leader or else he is preventing the girl from being who she ought to be free to be...etc. When we did we stop striving for an ideal where both men and women complimented each other, each being allowed their own strengths, and being equals rather than always rivals and competitors? So, again, a talented new author, but I have deep reservations about some of the messages in this book and I doubt I will recommend it to many people. Which is a shame considering the quality of the rest of the story, which is easily three stars for the prose, though the plot had a few spots that seemed out of place. Graceling never seemed like it should have been a love story (much less a hook-up), and I was loving it as a fine fantasy/ personal growth novel, but once they brought in the romantic/ anti-romantic elements, it lost me."}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "Graceling by Kristin Cashore follows in a burgeoning market for strong female characters.Katsa is much like Katniss from The Hunger Games in her naive perception of the world, her coldness and tendency towards pragmatic practicality. She is similar to Xhex from the Black Dagger Brotherhood in her disgust of all things \"feminine\". The story is well written, with engaging, fun characters. Katsa is fun to read about. The plot may be a little predictable at times but it did throw me a curve ball toward the end. The romance is lovely between Katsa and Po. I take exception though, to the message that this book sends. It is the same message I am reading over and over again in current literature.From Bella Swan who looks down on girls who like shopping, to Xhex who must be wrestled into a dress and who sees all signs of emotion as feminine weakness and now Katsa who refuses to marry or have children and who despises dresses and long hair.Message to authors: It is not nice dresses and pretty hair and an ability to be weepy on occasion that is the cause for the many inequality issues that women face. Putting a woman in pants does not change how the world perceives her. It doesn't suddenly make her stronger and better than the woman in the dress who likes jewelery!Your character does not suddenly become the beacon of the feminist movement because she doesn't like dresses. So sick of reading about \"strong, independent female characters\" who don't like dresses and spend most of the novel putting down almost every other female character as weak and pathetic."}, {"userName": "Krystle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2639204-krystle", "userReview": "Graceling has a beautiful cover, great premise, and lots of hype, and would be a terrific novel if it weren\u2019t for the terrible writing and atrocious main character. What is with the awkward sentence structures and prose in this book? \"In these dungeons the darkess was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind.\" It should be \"In these dungeons, the darkness was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind.\" And look at the next sentence: \"One that had so far proven to be correct, as Oll's maps tended to do.\" What? That made absolutely no sense. Instead: \"One that had so far proven to be correct, as Oll's maps tended to be.\" Wouldn't that be better?Then later on... \"Turning when it was time to turn...\" What? Isn't that redundant? And: \"She began to hear voices as she entered a corridor where the darkness flickered orange with the light of a torch set in the wall.\" Dude, darkness does not flicker orange, if it did then that would not make it dark. And it's not with the light of a torch, but light from a torch. That whole sentence is just full of awkward phrasing and clunky description.And the next: \"Katsa crept toward the light and the sound of laughter.\" How can she creep toward laughter when it wasn't even introduced earlier? It just does not get any better. And later on, she pulls her hood down over her eyes. What the hell. How do you expect to fight if you can't see where the heck you're going or what you're doing. It's not a surprise she trips over the four guards because OBVIOUSLY, you can't see anything! Why does she need to pull her hood down to hide her eyes when the guard she fights later ALREADY KNOWS WHAT SHE IS? Okay, that's it. I'm done. But the biggest offense of the book was the main character. Katsa is the most annoying, aggravating, self-centered, abusive, and violent character I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune to read from the eyes from. I thought Bella was tops (in annoying meter ranking), but Katsa wins the prize. During the book there were many instances where I wished I could rip her hair out and run her through with her own sword. She is the biggest Mary Sue I\u2019ve ever seen published. It wasn\u2019t so bad that she was Graced with some special ability but hers was off the wall unbelievable that I couldn\u2019t give her any sort of realistic credibility at all. Not only can she kill anyone with her bare hands, she\u2019s faster than anyone, builds fire better than anyone, hunts better than anyone, shoots and fires arrows better than anyone, yet she doesn\u2019t suffer from the freezing cold as the rest of her comrades - it just slows her down when other normal people would be down on the ground dying from hypothermia. She doesn\u2019t even tire like the rest of them because she just has unending bundles of stamina. So much so that she can go for days without sleeping even though they were in some pretty gruesome and difficult battles... And the list goes on. I mean what can Ms. Perfect not do? And don't give me that crap about how it's logical because of her special grace. There's a special balance between believable and ridiculous, and I'm sorry, but this is way over into the ridiculous area.But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. Katsa\u2019s most unredeemable factor was her attitude. No one can tell her to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to do even if it\u2019s for the wiser. And if she doesn\u2019t like what she hears, her first reaction is anger, and then she throws a tantrum until she gets her way. But yet, every situation she finds unappealing to her, the first though that comes to mind is violence. I clearly remember a scene where Po told her his opinion which wasn\u2019t demeaning, cruel, or hurtful at all, and you know what she does? Hits him so hard he falls off his chair and has a wicked bruise. W-T-F. And not only that, her characterization is inconsistent. She\u2019s supposed to be this bad ass chick who takes no crap from anyone and doesn't need a man in her life to define her but as soon as Po enters and tells her he\u2019s going to leave she cries tears because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know why\u201d? What the hell kind of crap is this? And what is her utter revulsion to marriage? I mean, I don\u2019t want to get married as well but Katsa\u2019s reasoning behind this is not concrete or sufficient enough to support her viewpoint that she vehemently defends many times throughout the book.I was absolutely disgusted, \ndisgusted\n, by the way she treated her horses. She treats them as a way to serve her own self-satisfying needs without care. The first instance that stuck me was when Po and Katsa were riding off somewhere and she slammed her horse against Po's because she wanted to get his attention. W-T-F! Not only is that dangerous to the rider because they could fall off, but it's dangerous to the horse! Slamming into another horse while you're riding is NOT something you do. The horse could have fallen because the impact threw him off balance, and you're obviously not going to walk away from that injury free, or it could have tripped and then fallen. Not to mention she ALWAYS pushes her horses to ride fast because she has no patience and wants to get there faster, and if someone tells her they needed to rest the horses or they'll break them, she just throws hissy fits about how they have to hurry and they're just slowing her down. Horses are not machines, good god! They're living, breathing animals that need care just like we do!The next one was near the end of the book where she pushed everyone so hard, and rode for hours at a blistering gallop just so they could reach their destination faster. And then I clearly remember someone, Skye, I believe it was telling her that she lamed a horse. And you know what Katsa\u2019s response to this was? \u201cOh, he\u2019s not lame! He\u2019s perfectly fine\u201d and then throws a fit about how he\u2019s slowing them down and they need to get up and ride him harder so they can get to their destination faster. OMFG! I almost threw the book across the room in rage.The place names were very uncreative. You might think they\u2019re clever but they were shallow attempts at trying to make them seem more \u201cfantasy\u201d epic-like. They were just barely concealed renamings of East, West, South, North, and Middle. And I didn\u2019t even get started on the writing. It was super choppy, suffered from an annoying excess of repetitive phrasing, and without a lot of \u201cshowing\u201d. The structure was all the same. Katsa went and did this, did that, felt this, and so on and so forth. Another problem was the insane amounts of info-dumping in the beginning. After the third page, I just couldn\u2019t give a rip about the places\u2019 history, what it looked like, who was who\u2019s father.I can see why a lot of people love this book. There\u2019s romance, a super strong female character that kicks butt, and the tried and true quest/adventure formula of a fantasy novel. But it\u2019s just not for me. I absolutely hate not finishing a series so I\u2019ll probably read the next one, but ugh, not looking forward to it. My opinion? Avoid this book like the plague. I may probably be stoned to death for this review because every where I go it seems to be so well loved and praised with glowing reviews."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "First thing I need to point out is that I consider myself a feminist, even as far as to take an active role is such matters. Previously, I have written articles on Feministing and I honestly think so many of these issues are still very important in today's world. However you look at it, the battle for equality has not been won and has, in fact, become rather dormant.On that note, I love reading fiction by feminist writers, Atwood never fails to deliver and The Handmaid's Tale is one of my favourite books of all time. Similarly with Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, except Woolf's writing can make you want to slit your wrists at times. The point of me saying this is that when I heard Graceling called 'feminist propaganda', rather than being repelled, I was intrigued. I love modern stories with strong heroines who can stand up for themselves and don't need to wait for prince charming to swoop in and save them. Katsa fit this in many ways, true, but I have so many issues with the feminist ideals in this novel that I don't know where to begin.I am constantly faced with the irritating irony of radical feminists. The irony being that their favourite passtime is telling women what to do. Real feminism (as in the one that actually cares about women) is about choice, not about having to follow strict guidelines in order to banish the image of feminity. It's people like Kristin Cashore who make the term 'feminism' seem like a dirty word. Being strong and capable of making your own decisions is one thing... but the extremes of having to prove that you don't care about your looks or refusing to wear a dress is ridiculous. I wear dresses, I wear make-up, I like to make the effort to look nice... but in Cashore's world that means I'm a weak, pathetic wannabe-housewife.For me, the main mistake that Cashore makes is to assume that anything 'girly' is bad. It's an ongoing debate about women and feminism. For example, take the stereotype that women are more emotional and are therefore more weak than men. The argument is: Is this wrong and women are not more emotional? Or does what's wrong lie in the idea that emotions are a weakness because they are a feminine trait? Radical feminism continues to try and spit on traditional aspects of what it means to be feminine. Of course, it is arguable that the idea of 'feminine' is created through socialisation (e.g. dressing babies in either pink or blue depending on gender), but it has long been my opinion that if you take the colour pink (a worldwide symbol of the female gender) and make it into something that should be disgusting, then that's about as anti-woman as you can get.Margaret Atwood understood the dangers of radicalism and wrote the novel to go with it. In the same way that extreme socialism becomes the mirror of totalitarianism, radical feminism begins to mirror sexism. And that's why I had issues with a great deal of Graceling. But... what I did like was the love story between Katsa and Po, once Katsa got over the idea that he would somehow take possession of her after sex. Po was a sweetheart and an all-round likeable character. And, don't get me wrong, I never really disliked Katsa because the fact that she refuses to wear a dress and doesn't want children is entirely her choice and that's what's important. I liked her strength and at many times I felt her frustration... particularly with regards to the girls throughout the kingdoms who were never taught to protect themselves because their fathers and brothers were expected to do it. I completely agree with the idea that the girls should have been taught self-defence and self-sufficiency.The whole backdrop of magical kingdoms and whatnot was alright. It fit nicely around the main characters but I found the love story to hold most of my attention and that's why I've decided that I don't want to read Fire. The reviews of it tell me that romance comes far behind the whole fantasy aspect and I still have Tolkien nightmares. Yeah so, not a bad story but so many things disagreed with what I stand for."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "it is so hard to write reviews for books i actually like. no, love.talking about this book is like trying to describe to someone a relationship from long ago that was bittersweet and is now over, but i have never had a relationship that involved so many horses and swordplay, not even metaphorically. and fewer people care about my love life than about this book. (i see you ariel - you are glowering at me with tiny slitted eyes)but this book is like a wonderfully sweet relationship. at the beginning, you can't even imagine how you ever got along without it.and your friends (ariel) try to talk you out of it \"oh, don't get with that guy, he gave me herpes\" or whatever... but at the beginning everything was shiny and magical and when things started to go a little bit awry, i wrote it off as a glitch - a bad day that didn't necessarily mean that we weren't super awesome soulmates.(because it's true - the \"girl time in the mountain\" sequence was the weakest, but i really thought the book rebounded to perfection afterward. we can forgive one drunken dalliance, can't we? one lapse in judgment?? what happens n graceling stays in graceling? yes?)i just loved so much about this book - i never ever get invested in the love story side plots of these teen fiction books - i have yet to be on a \"team\". but this time, i fully believed in their attraction, and i really wanted these crazy kids to get together and kick ass together forever. their fighting scenes, when they were fighting each other, were hugely erotic,and for once the male lead seemed worthy in a way that others have not been. their shyness, their tenderness.... i found it very sweet. and if i was a crying type of girl, i would definitely have cried at this one.so i am seriously bummed that the sequel is about the early life and times of king lamewad and not about anyone i actually cared about. but i will probably read it anyway, completist that i am.and eventually, because i think i have largely abandoned this metaphor, and it is very important to follow through, even though there were bumps in the road and people got hurt and friends were less free with advice in the future, the experience was a generally positive one, and the memory lives on as an Important Time where everything seemed possible. even liking a book ariel said was bad..."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679025-penny", "userReview": "Updated 04/01/14: I happen to like books which feature kick-ass feminist heroines and are light on the romance so I should like this book, right? Yeah, but I don't. First of all, Katsa acts like a petulant little girl throughout the entire book, not some strong feminist poster woman. Katsa shows very little, if any, personal growth over the course of this novel. Also, I felt like the author spent too much time trying to sell us on the following ideas: femininity is an idea forced upon women by the patriarchy, men don't respect women, commitment ruins relationships, marriage is a tool of the devil, and so on. Look, I understand that some women feel that way, and I'm completely cool with it. I'd be lying if I claimed that I've never thought some of the same things during my lifetime. That said, I hate how the author seems to be shoving very specific views down my throat instead of telling me a story that challenges me to think for myself. This book is written in such a way that it makes me think Cashore, the author, is using her character, her story as a vehicle to voice her very strong opinions. Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily have a problem with that sort of thing, it's just that this book is being touted as 'feminist' but I fail to see true feminism within the pages of this book. I mean, I guess you could consider it a version of feminism, but it's not very inclusionary. In fact, it's a very bigoted version of feminism. Other than Katsa every other woman in this book is portrayed as weak and dumb. So basically unless you're an angry, dress-hating, man-hating woman with an aversion to commitment there is something wrong with you. News Flash: femininity isn't anti-feminist. I'm sorry but it is possible for independent, intelligent and stable women to embrace femininity without losing credibility. And anyway, isn't that the point of the feminist movement? Gaining equality without having to act like 'one of the guys'? I mean, sure, you can reject femininity if you want, but don't go around assuming that those who are feminine are pathetic weakling losers who do nothing to help the cause. It just so turns out that line of thought is backward and does nothing to advance the cause. Also, Katsa's view of other women in the realm is quite condescending in that she never seems to consider how privileged she is compared to some of these other women. Katsa's lucky in that she has the ability to kill pretty much anyone she wants so it's not like she has to do a damn thing anyone tells her to do. Despite all the crap she supposedly has to put up with, Katsa has benefitted from an education and she's also afforded more freedoms than most women because someone else pays her bills. She doesn't have to milk the cows or churn butter or become a serving wench. She doesn't have to prostitute herself out in order to make ends meet.Girlfriend needs to shut the hell up about all that because it's not like she's doing anything other than making a-hole observations. Katsa's not doing anything to change the way all women in the realm are treated, which is fine, it's her life, whatever. She just needs to quit it with the judgmental attitude toward others who can't afford to live or think the way she does. I could have handled Katsa's aversion to having a relationship with Poe if she hadn't had any feelings for him, or if she knew she wasn't emotionally ready to make any sort of commitment. But no, Katsa's aversion to commitment was built up do be some great personal strength of hers. In the end it just felt like she ('she' being Katsa. Or Cashore. Kat-Shore?) was trying to prove a point or something, like \"look at how independent I am. I'm not a barnacle. I don't need a man...except for when I needs teh sex. So Poe, my lover, sorry you lost your sight and all but I'll prolly be drunk-dialing you in the future, cause I am comfortable with my sexuality. kthanxbai.\" *sob* \"Walking away is waaaaay hard, which is why I am so strong.\" *sob* \"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrl Powerrrrrr!\" Yeah, because being in a loving, trusting, equal and committed relationship isn't a sign of strength. Strength can only be had by loners who don't like to commit because doing so will supposedly lower their self-worth ...ummm....I mean...\"independent\" people. Also, it has to be said: The love scene grosses me out as much or more than the sex scene(s) in Titanic and/or Avatar. Some people just don't know how to write a love scene. James Cameron and Kristin Cashore are among that group. One last thing: why is it that no one seems to have an issue with Katsa hitting Po, literally knocking him to the ground so hard that he bruises? All he did was voice his opinion, that's it. Had the tables been turned, had Po hit Katsa for voicing her opinion, you people would be unbelievably angry. I'm sure some of you would be burning Cashore in effigy. Let's do a little more of this whole turning tables thing. Pretend that Katsa is actually a male character and Po is female. Okay, how much do you love this new topsy-turvy version of Graceling? Not very much, you say? Yeah, I thought so. If you ask me Katsa is one of the least deserving protagonists. She's a violent, judgmental a-hole who shows little to no personal growth over the course of this entire book. I don't care if she had a difficult childhood, having a difficult childhood doesn't mean you have to go around inflicting the worst parts of yourself on others. Having a difficult childhood doesn't give you license to be an awful person.Two stars because the concept was cool. Too bad it was poorly executed."}, {"userName": "Rhea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16732603-rhea", "userReview": "[The Graceling/Teletubbies Parody*To the tune of the Teletubby theme song*Tinkywinky...Dipsey...Katsa...Po...Teletubbies...

But sometimes one of the voices rubbed me the wrong way and the music went from fantasy to what sounded like western music. Lol. Maybe it was just me! I still loved the book though =) I am in love with Katsa! She is an awesome inspiration for women warriors in a book. She kicks arse and takes names. I love the fact that she doesn't care anything about marriage or having kids. She's like my hero. I need a tshirt!!! I wish I had her Grace :) The characters in the book are so wonderful, even the evil jerks are played out very well. I was so happy when Katsa met Po! Are they made for each other or what?! I don't like what happened to Po though :( I have a special place in my heart for Oll, Raffin, Bann, Bitterblue and Helda. These are some wonderful characters with a great family/friendship. Katsa isn't like normal women, well that's obvious, but she doesn't care about any of the every day things women care about. She even hates her long hair because it's in her way of doing what she's trying to do :) Katsa is Randa's mercenary and her, Oll and Giddon go out to do his bidding, although it's Katsa that dishes out the pain. After some time she starts to get tired of doing this to people. You will have to read the book to see where that goes. Giddon is a good person, he just doesn't really understand Katsa and wants too much. I enjoyed all of the fighting and sparring between Po and Katsa. I loved when she was in a real fight too :) Not very many, but they were the best. Then again, most people would walk or run away when they saw her coming anyway. She's that bad and scary ! :)Did I mention Katsa has some cool eyes! A lot of the Gracelings have different eyes from everyone else, but Katsa has some beautiful ones.

I understand this desire for independence very well. For the longest time I myself refused idea of marriage and I don't have kids, but even I find Katsa's unyielding desire to never marry or to commit strange, considering her journey in this novel. The saddest thing about this book is definitely the epilogue. It is so unsatisfying to me that Katsa, even after all her adventures and all the proof of Po's love and devotion to her, still chooses to do \"as she pleases\" - to go about her business leaving Po behind to be her occasional lover, to make sure she does not \"stop him from loving anyone else.\" I can't stop myself from asking - is this really love? to go as you please and leave the man you love to look for someone else to love? is this really love to make your own choices without factoring in your partner and your partner's wishes into your plans for the future? is this love when you decide what will happen in your life and your partner settles for anything you can give him, no matter how little it is? My answer is \"no.\" I am not propagating marriage here in any way, but I do feel that Katsa at the least is insecure and doesn't trust Po's love for her and at the most is selfish in her petulant decision to stay her own woman by refusing any claim Po can possible have on her (be that a wife or a life partner). I fail to understand why Katsa thinks that marrying Po or committing herself to him fully would ever put constraints on her independence? Does she know him at all? If she trusts Po so little, why is she with him? If all she wants is sex, can't she find a man who is as afraid of commitment as she is? Why hurt Po so? And how long such relationship can last while Katsa is being her own woman and encouraging Po to go around looking for someone else to love? In the end, I just feel that Cashore here lost an opportunity to show Katsa's emotional growth. I don't mean that marriage to Po would have proven her to be a better person, but the ability to fully commit and to surrender to and to trust her partner, certainly would. In my eyes, Katsa starts her journey being scared of trusting people and fearful of commitment, and ends it without changing in any significant way. It makes me sad for her, because in real life people stuck on their trust issues, people who do not grow and change and learn to trust, fail their relationships over and over again. Cashore tries to portray Katsa's decision as a triumph of her independence, but for me it is merely an indication of a victory of Katsa's fears over her life experiences. And here is the last argument I am going to make against the message of this book. Imagine if it were Po who made Katsa's decisions - Po who says he will never marry Katsa, Po who will never agree to give her children, Po who will ride around going about his business and occasionally meeting Katsa for hook-ups. What would we call such a man? A commitment-phobic pig? And yet, we call Katsa a feminist and a strong woman. There is a disconnect here somewhere, don't you think?Katsa and Po will appear in Cashore's next book \"Bitterblue\" and I am very curious to see where she is planning to take their relationship. I wish them happiness, but with current attitude of Katsa's I simply don't see it happening.

She's been one ever since she discovered the power of her killing Grace. Only...she starts to wonder, does she have to be?\nWhen a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else?\n In the Graceling Realm, those born with heterochromia (different colored eyes) also have a Grace. A Grace can be anything from the mundane (i.e. holding your breath indefinitely) to the cruel (i.e. mind control). Katsa has been \"blessed\" with a killing grace. A Gracling born into her kingdom is automatically offered to the King (her uncle). Under his thumb, she murdered, tortured and struck horror across his lands and the seven kingdoms.However, as she grew older, she became less comfortable in her own skin. So, she formed an alliance with sympathizers and started moonlighting as a hero. When a mysterious prince - one with a silver eye and a gold eye and graced with fighting - visits to her kingdom, she finds herself questioning everything she's ever done.First off - abso-freaking-lutely loved this premise. The powers, the squabbling kingdoms, the atmosphere. YES. \nMercy was more frightening than murder, because it was harder.\nSecond off - I loved Katsa's strength.  She's far stronger than any man in the kingdom - but the writing and the characterization is done so well that she never dips a toe into Mary Sue territory nor does she get thrown into the self-sacrificing-woe-is-me category. She's a badass who's earned her credentials.  And, I adore her sass: \nPerhaps I can stay by the fire and mend your socks and scream if I hear any strange noises.\nThird off - I loved the love. There was no falling in love at first sight, no shoe-horned love triangle and NO weird YA boy smells. I adored all the sweet moments between Katsa and her beau (Po) and I will defend their love to my dying day. They have such a stable, healthy relationship (something that is woefully in short supply in YA).\nKatsa sat in the darkness of the Sunderan forest and understood three truths. She loved Po. She wanted Po. And she could never be anyone's but her own.\nIf you are in the mood for quality YA lit - pick this series up. You won't regret it.

Did it become something else?\u201d \nI honestly didn\u2019t know anything about this, but I'd seen it around and finally it was recommended enough. I was really surprised by the depth of this story and the characters. The story revolves around Katsa, who lives in a world where people can be born with a \u2018Grace.\u2019 Meaning, aside from two-different eye colors, they have an exceptional skill. Katsa\u2019s grace is killing, for which she has served as a sort of \u2018thug\u2019 for her king.Pros:Can I just say how much I loved Po? He was such a strong, dynamic character. I really appreciated that he wasn\u2019t weakened to further enunciate Katsa\u2019s power\u2014he\u2019s just strong in different ways.(I'm also kind of in love with him)This is slow-burn done right. The romance didn\u2019t spin in needless circles, but developed naturally as the characters interacted with each other more. Overall, the plot was exceptionally creative. The world-building was handled with care and I really could picture these lands. The villain was terrifying and well-set-up. Their skill is especially interesting and terrifying to me, and I found myself wanting more of their backstory. There\u2019s a really fantastic discussion regarding romantic relationships and compromising one\u2019s self. I love how incredibly healthy I found this romance. There\u2019s marked discussion about the differences between training/fighting and striking out in anger (which is not seen as okay). I love how Katsa starts this novel not wanting children (she doesn\u2019t hate them\u2014she just doesn\u2019t want to be a mother) or to marry, and this decision remains the same despite falling in love. Really, it\u2019s not often for a positive portrayal of a woman who doesn\u2019t want kids and/or views marriage as a social contract (which is even more pronounced in this world) and I really appreciated this. Katsa's overall character arc is gradual but definite. Her development was handled exceptionally, and she really ends this book changed completely. Cons:I had a few issues with the pacing\u2014namely the climax seems a surprise, and there\u2019s a lot of time spent talking afterwards. Giddon seems to exist to represent a sort of benevolent sexism. I really appreciated the way this was portrayed, and his words to Katsa are certainly something several modern women are familiar with:\n\"You're not an unnatural woman, Katsa. [\u2026] You'll want babies. I'm certain of it.\" \nWhat I didn\u2019t like about Giddon was how random his feelings for Katsa seemed. She seems the exact opposite of the tradition he favors and nothing like a woman he would want running his household. I wish this had been expanded upon or given more depth, because it felt like this plot existed only to fit in such quotes. I didn\u2019t quite like how Po gave Katsa permission to \u201cknock him out\u201d when she needed time to herself, but do think he was an important decision for her to make regarding her development. Most of the criticism I see for this seems to revolve around it being \u201cfeminist propaganda.\u201d Which I find a little ridiculous I think the complaints are mostly about how powerful Katsa is\u2014and I will admit she does border on being really over powered. But I found her emotions more flawed and complex, and her overall arc much more fascinating. My main problem is that Katsa seems to be the only portrayal of a \u2018strong\u2019 woman in the story. I don\u2019t have a problem with a woman refusing dresses and long hair and conforming to more typically \u2018masculine\u2019 standards, but I had wish it was better expressed this isn\u2019t the only depiction of a strong woman. There are other females characters, like Bitterblue and Helda, but they don\u2019t have near as much impact or depth. In Conclusion:This was a surprisingly introspective fantasy with interesting characters and worlds! I was really surprised by the depth of this book and the intelligence of the writing, though I had a few minor issues."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "Loved it. Except for the raging feminist agenda.NOTE: Since these two brief, flippant sentences have gotten so many trolls over the years, I'll just add that I support the book's feminist ideals 100%. What I do not like is the way we're hammered over the head with the message. (The \"raging\" part, if you will.) It's inelegant, tiresome soapboxing that managed to annoy someone who actually agrees with the principles, so I don't know how it's going to persuade anyone who does not. Katsa's views also express the kind of feminism that seem to be extremely critical of other women's choices, which I found off-putting.There's a lengthy discussion below where I go into my feelings further with people who are discussing in a reasonable manner, although I certainly don't need to justify my opinions to those who are only interested in telling people off on the internet. Nice job on not bothering to do 2 seconds' more research, but hey. Self-righteous outrage is so much easier.But you know, people who don't agree with the book's feminine philosophy actually do have a right to that opinion, too. Why is it so goddamned difficult to respect that? That doesn't seem to be in the spirit of independent thinking and free will that feminism is purportedly all about.I've come to realize that I probably shouldn't have used the word \"agenda,\" however. As someone who believes that women are capable of carving out whatever life they want (though, I might add, Katsa is not nearly so tolerant of other women's choices) and not being as aware of how politically charged that word has become in denigrating causes/beliefs, I didn't read the same kinds of negative connotations into it that clearly others have.

Soooo I thought this was some kind of Hunger Games-type dystopian story about a girl who could kill with her touch for some reason and put off reading it because I wasn't huge on Shatter Me. BUT then this turned out to be full of castles and princes and everything I love so that was a fun surprise!I'm extremely neutral about this book, though. There were a few elements I liked (mostly the castles and princes), but the worldbuilding was weak and the writing itself was really dull. I didn't particularly connect with anything throughout the slow plot, honestly. It wasn't bad... it just kind of skimmed the surface of what it could've been. Some better worldbuilding or character development would've helped a lot.I think I've just read so many other books about girl assassins/killers at this point that I needed a unique element or stronger story. SOMETHING. I thought the Graceling aspect was kind of underused or boring (aside from how Katsa's eyes were two different colors). I wasn't that into the romance, either. The fact that his name was Po didn't help much...I really wasn't big on Katsa, though. Her character was equally hard to pin down, yet annoying. Like there's a difference between being tough/badass and being straight up rude and she kind of missed the mark on that one. Katsa's personality is mostly self-righteous aggression. I mean, SHE HITS PO -- how is any of that ok?And I wouldn't necessarily herald this book as being feminist like I've heard because Katsa doesn't really support or attempt to understand other women's choices. The underlying message in some parts is pretty black/white... like women either have power or give it up to a guy. There isn't a range of ways for women to be strong. (And it's fine that she doesn't want to marry, but if her independent identity actually hinges on not needing a guy, then it still revolves around men... just the lack thereof). Most of the story was just felt like a weird and poorly executed attempt to create a \"strong\" female MC.So yeah, this book brought absolutely nothing new to the table and was just very, very average and anticlimactic.

Basically, I think it's completely hilarious how many people are shocked and appalled that 1) there is sex in this book, and 2) the heroine does not desire to get married or have children. Guess what? Young adults *do* have sex. And the idea that it's not love if you don't want to marry them, or that you shouldn't have sex until you're married is why all the poor children in your congregation are marrying the first person they have the hots for and getting divorces at 24 with 3 kids. Also, the fact that the heroine doesn't want to get married or have kids is shocking to you because EVERY OTHER WOMAN OR GIRL IN EVERY BOOK YOU'VE READ THIS YEAR is aiming for that brass ring of Mrs.-dom and 2.5 mini-Hims. Why should you be so concerned that this one book is going to crumble the foundation stones of your Evangelical God Mall? Instead of your pearl-clutching, maybe take a moment to think: wait, is it possible to have ovaries but not idealize wedded bliss? Even if your parents died young, your only parental figure uses you as a weapon, and you're basically incapable of forming bonds with people because everyone's terrified of you and always has been and as a result you're emotionally stunted?

But I fought my way through it because, goshdarnit, I picked it up at the library, dragged it home with a load of other books and groceries, and renewed it the max number of times - I was gonna finish it.You know the kickbutt heroine who is just totally kickbutt and doesn't need no one, no way, no how, and yet loves and feels and hurts deeply and yet keeps everyone away because she is baaaaaad? Yeah, that one. I hate her. You know the quiet, loving hero who worships the ground his heroine walks on and yet is reasonably kickbutt himself, while at the same time deferring to the heroine's wishes and not fulfilling any of his own? I hate him, too. Katsa was a child, and I hated that she and Po meandered their way into a sexual relationship because of 'twu wuv' and the fact that she would be tied down if she married. By golly, dontcha know you don't have to be married to have sex and lead a wonderful, fulfilling life? Now imagine the situation reversed - if Po had fallen in 'twu wuv' with Katsa, but would never contemplate marriage because he thought it would tie him down and keep him from true freedom... Wow, that would be really, really sexist. And lame. But if a woman does it to the man whom she loves (and who loves her in return), it's a point for us rockin' feminists. Please. Please. For the love of good fantasy fiction, let's write and read about realistic characters and remember that what's good for the goose is good for the gander. I would have hated it if Po had refused to marry Katsa for the reasons stated above, but neither do I enjoy it when the poor guy's just supposed to be some worthless blob waiting for her to come home from her adventures, beat him at fights, and then run off into the wild blue yonder again. Isn't marriage/love supposed to be a give-and-take between equals? If Katsa had scorned marriage in the beginning and rethought her view after learning that Po's love would never keep her bound, there would have been something to say in defense of this novel.I suppose the idea of the Grace and the Kingdoms, etc. was good, but the childish, flat chracters and overdone prose made it a difficult, boring read that could have been halved and still felt too long. And best wishes to the youth who read this and decide that sex isn't a big deal, that it can happen as long as you KNOW you're in love (because, obviously, it's easy to know when you're that age), and that 'marriage' is a synonym for 'slavery'."}, {"userName": "Fables&Wren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780417-fables-wren", "userReview": "WrensReads Review:If you know anything about me, you\u2019ll know that Shannon Hale and Gail Carson Levine are two authors that have dreamed up books that made a handprint on my childhood. They are lively and they are uplifting and they shine girls in a light that the media and history turn a blind eye to.Well, now I am going to add Kristin Cashmore to that list.She writes exactly like those two ladies mentioned about, but for a slightly older age group. She grasps the fairytale feel by the hand and wrote this story about a girl who is stronger than her male-counterparts and believes in being a strong, independent woman who doesn\u2019t need a man. That phrase couldn\u2019t describe a character better. Katsa literally doesn\u2019t want to get married and doesn\u2019t want kids. She doesn\u2019t want a politically-binding marriage where she is supposed to be on the sidelines and just support her husband and his ambitions. She wants to support her own ambitions. Katsa is a Graceling, meaning she has two-colored eyes and has a special ability of some sort. Her ability is death. She is an amazing fighter and she never loses. She is a gifted-killer. So what does her uncle king do with that information? He uses her to take out all of the people against him, or really anyone who won\u2019t just do what he says. But she doesn\u2019t like doing what she is doing and doesn\u2019t see a way out of it until she meets a fellow Graceling named Po. He is a skilled fighter as well, but not as good as Katsa. He has an underlining secret that could get him killed. When Katsa finds out, she isn\u2019t sure she can trust him. But she doesn\u2019t get a chance to find out because there are troubles in the neighboring kingdoms.There is a king who is after a family member of Po\u2019s and they have to find out why. And when they do... the two of them are the only ones who can put everything back the way it needed to be. Sociopaths are a real thing and I am happy someone wrote about one so well in a fantasy setting. Like what if someone so corrupt got such a powerful gift? The answer is in this book; which by the way, this king is so well written that I was scared out of my wits. And the audio for this book is a full-cast and it was amazing. I read along to it and just found myself lost in how well it was told.This whole story was so enchanting. I didn\u2019t know I needed to read this book until I was finally in the middle of it. It\u2019s so empowering and shows you how important trust is and self-preservation and self-love. I feel as if not only women and girls need to read this, but boys and men.

My dinner is getting cold, and I have dreams to crush. Ready? Andiamo!BOOM #1: KatsaWhile I love the author's intent for empowerment with Katsa, she was a bit too much of a special snowflake for me. I will forever fist-pump to her unstoppable strength as a warrior, a woman and a person, but at the end of the day she was highly unrealistic and too much of a caricature for me. She's kind of a double edged-sword in terms of her feminist appeal, too. Instead of helping the women in the rest of the land to defend themselves and educating them on how to be stronger and stand up for themselves, which she has the means and freedom to do (as a privileged person; Katsa has grown up surrounded by wealth and resources. She is oppressed as a woman, treated terribly, but institutional class privilege still exists and it still works in her favour compared to all the poor women living in squalor and within unwanted marriages across the land) she simply looked down on them because they were not as physically strong as she. Feminism is about appreciating, supporting and celebrating women of all tastes, backgrounds, creeds and lifestyles, and it's sad that this book did not hit the mark in this area. Check your privilege, know your capabilities, lend a hand. (And support your sisters, not just your cis-ters.)Having said that, it was refreshing to experience a female character who leaps off the page, doesn't take a single smidge of shit, and who doesn't fuck around with a silly \"what about teh menz\" mantra. I regret my response a couple of years ago when I read this and was still dealing with some internalized misogyny, using ridiculous terms like \"sexism against men\" and \"feminazi\". This book is the result of righteous female anger against a genre and a world that treats women like inhuman shit. This book is important, despite some of its messages missing the mark, and when I read it now through twenty-year-old eyes, more seasoned eyes, eyes that have done their reading and lived some experiences and become righteous in their own female anger, it is cast in a new light. I also see and very much like the great focus on female relationships in this book - we go through a thick wedge of pages in which it is just Katsa and Bitterblue, no knights in shining armour in sight. No men, just women being comrades in arms. Alas, Bitterblue is a princess, privileged in status, and again I find myself wishing Katsa's power had reached out and perhaps changed the lives of others less fortunate for the better. She could have taught the girls who cut her hair, who so relied on the men in their lives to protect them, how to hold a knife or be self-sufficient but she simply moved on and forgot about them.(I've learned since that Katsa opens a school for teaching girls how to fight, but I have not read any other books in this series. I can only review what I have read.)On a high note, Cashore does earn significant Brownie points for making Katsa unapologetically sexual, and for adding a nice little birth control accent to round off the whole sex thing on a safe note. It's a shitty trope in YA that \"if you have sex you will get pregnant and die\". In the background, Katsa is laughing.BOOM #2: PlotThe plot of this book was strong, though a lot of time was spend riding around on horses to nowhere. It would have been nice to always know what was going on, but I suppose we can't have everything.BOOM #3: PacingThe pacing was slow. A hundred pages could have been shaved off and we wouldn't be any the wiser. However, the strong opening chapters and the time Katsa spent in the court moved swiftly and was a fair hook.BOOM #4: Love interestI say love interest because Po was nothing more than that. It was wonderful to read a book in which the main male character did not upstage the heroine and did not take it upon himself to defend her ovaries, because Po always respected Katsa'a strength of body and character. I do wish, however, that Po would have been less of a two-dimensional doormat. The way he simply shrugged off being hit so hard he fell out of his chair and bled was alarming. There is never any excuse for hitting one's partner, regardless of the victim's gender, age, size, sexuality, etcetera.Hitting your partner doesn't make you strong or passionate, it makes you an asshole. And you lose even more points if you hit them on reflex. Hitting when you know what you're doing is one thing but when you lash out as a natural reaction to upsetting news then you need even more therapy than you did when you knew what you were doing.Just don't fucking hit the people you love. Don't hit anyone. Okay? BOOM #5: WritingThe writing was solid, enjoyable, if sometimes a little muddled. I occasionally found myself re-reading sentences multiple times because they didn't make sense. Also, the overuse of commas was irritating. But the dialogue was good, clearly well thought-out, and for a high fantasy setting the tense and person was well-chosen.BOOM #6: Don't hurt your animalsSeriously. The amount of animal mistreatment in this book was unsettling. Katsa lames a horse because she rides it over unsuitable terrain, and then furiously demands they kick it on regardless. Note: horses can literally die from issues with their feet and legs. However, it should bear in one's mind that this book is written in an old-timey fantasy setting where people didn't really give a shit about the needs of horses or the injustice of foie gras.BOOM #7: ConclusionThere's a lot to love here, but I did have some issues, mostly with the slow pacing, meandering plot and Katsa being a little too much of a perfect petunia and thus sort of unrelatable. That said, there's action and some lovely imagery and empowerment - so much empowerment. This book will make you grow; it did me.

I have thought about this book a lot, and the fact that I really disagreed with the message about women, what empowers women, how they show that they are 'strong' and 'independent' women. I am going to downgrade my rating because I felt like the message in this book was too blatant and leading. It feels manipulative to me, and that's an issue I can't get past. Ultimately an author has a choice of what kind of story they choose to write. I don't have to agree with it. I would hope that they would just tell the story instead of preaching. In this case, there was a lot of not so subliminal preaching going on in this story, that on further analysis, I can't get past. Sadly, I liked the idea and some of the concepts. I liked that Katsa was imperfect. I really liked Po, but even he is a bit of a 'too good to be' true creation that makes the message come across better from the author. I mean, you need a good, kind, loving man who is very tolerant to allow himself to be treated the way Katsa does him. Womanly strength is not 'one' thing. Like the rainbow, a spectrum of colors composite womanly strength. A housewife with children is just as strong as a woman who never marries, takes lovers, and goes around fighting battles. And there is a somewhere in-between, to be sure. To assume that there should be one extreme or the other, or that either choice is wrong for every women is a fallacy. I don't want to get preachy here, so I'll stop right here with that train of thought. I think that as far as other aspects, my review stands. But as far as the message in this book, it impels me to go back on my original review. I'm downgrading this to three stars.I don't feel I should change the original review without rereading, so I add the update as a caveat. So, if you read my review, the math doesn't add up with the final rating. If I do reread this, I will alter the whole review.****************************************************************************************************Simply put, I found this to be a fantastic book. I loved the world that Ms. Cashore built. The concept of the Graced individuals was fascinating. I liked the way the Graced stood out with their eyes that are different colors from each other, and their phenomenal abilities that varied between each Graced person. And the characters that inhabit this story...well they weren't ones you could easily forget about or dismiss.Let's start with Katsa. I felt for her. She was basically her uncle, King Randa's goon. He sent her to hurt people for his own selfish ends. Her Grace became something she hated about herself. It took Po's love and acceptance to get her to see that her Grace was a blessing, and to see it for what it was. Not the power to kill, but the power to make a difference. Katsa had some serious control issues. I totally empathized with her on that. Being under someone's thumb and control is an ugly, ugly thing. I could see why she wanted to be free to make her own decisions. So, that was something I respected about her, but it led to a big issue I had with this story, which I will go into shortly. That withstanding, even though I really disliked a decision she was set on, I loved her. I thought she was a great character. Her strength as a person was formidable. Her determination to protect others and to survive any obstacle humbled me. I admired her so much, it brought tears to my eyes. Po was fantastic. Sometimes I am somewhat skeptical about these wonderful men that women authors write. Do they write men that they feel that women will instinctively love, or are there men out there as wonderful as Po is? I hope I meet one. Haven't just yet (no offense to the great guys I know). Po got my attention, and kept it, from the first meeting, in which he ends up encountering Katsa, and being one of the few who are somewhat of a challenge to her as a fighter. Po has a gypsy sort of vibe that reminded me of another favorite, Cam Rohan, from romance novels by Lisa Kleypas. He has an ease in his skin which makes him very attractive. He's gorgeous and sensual (not too sensual for a young adult book---but it's there alright). He's a great fighter. He's intelligent, resourceful, supportive, and insightful. He has a sense of adventure and an air of mystique. He was a really good guy. I couldn't love him more. Yet Po hides a secret that actually makes him a great counterpart to Katsa, although she has to take time to accept that he can see and perceive her in ways that no one else can. He has to come to terms with his own Grace, and that journey will not be without anguish to him. I overuse the term soulmates in my reviews, probably because I'm the sappy romantic who believes in this concept. But Po is without a doubt the one soulmate for Katsa. That made me more able to accept an issue I had from the romantic angle. The secondary characters were very distinct and absorbing. Young Bitterblue is a character that really stood out. I loved her by the end of this book, and I look forward to reading her book when it comes out. The poor girl. What she suffered. It was completely harrowing! Then there's Prince Raffin. He was adorable. I hope we see him again and see him find his bride. Oh, the awful villain. I won't say who it is, but he was an abomination! He got exactly what he deserved! No question.The world itself: Ms. Cashore stuck to simplicity and it paid off. She writes a world that looked a lot like our own, but the people in it gave this book the fantasy feel. If you like survival books and journey/quest books, you'll love this. It made me want to bone up on my non-existent survival skills. I couldn't do it justice the way Katsa and Po do. I liked the idea of the Seven Kingdoms, and how they related to each other. Far and above, Po's people stood out, with their penchant for jewelry, their dark hair and gray eyes--their culture was nicely distinctive. They had a Roma (gypsy) vibe that I liked. The action and adventure were par excellence. I love both, and I heartily recommend this book, if you are of the same mind. If you love a heroine who can more than handle her own, and the combination of a tough heroine and hero fighting at each other's side, you will love this book. The fight scenes are thrilling and awesome. The violence is not so graphic that it's disturbing, but there is death and blood in this book. But, the value of life is very much made clear by the author. I think this book sends a good message to younger readers in how she handles some tough issues such as using power in a way that is helpful and not selfish and hurtful to others.Okay, now I'll talk about the romance: It was scintillating, completely appealing. Katsa and Po had great chemistry. You knew they were for each other and no one else. You could see why they loved each other. This book does have some love scenes, but they aren't descriptive enough to be unsuitable for young adult books, but they had enough steam to make this book sizzle in a way that would appeal to a fan of adult romances, at least in my opinion. A good steam factor is about chemistry, and it was there in spades here. Also, there was that vibe of a love that was too strong to resist. Let me get into my one and only issue with this story. Katsa did not want to fall in love. She didn't want to give her heart away. She did not want to be owned, and not really to belong to anyone. She vowed not to marry or have children. One one level I could completely understand that, but it also frustrated me. I think Po more than showed he was the kind of man who would never try to own or control her. I think he gave her more than 100% of himself, but I felt she didn't give herself fully in return. I think agreeing to marry him would have showed her trust and love for him in return. I felt she did love him and show it, but I also felt she was holding a large part of her essential self back. And thus, the true romantic in me was unsettled and dissatisfied with the resolution of this book. I hope and pray that eventually Katsa will marry Po. I think he deserves that show of trust from her. I can't get away from my feelings about love. I think if you love someone enough, you want to marry them, and there is no substitute. That's my personal belief. And, it made the way this book ended a big issue for me. So, on the romantic front, this was not a 5 star book. It's more like a four. As a fantasy and a book overall, there is no question that this book is a five star book. But, if you are reading this as a romance, it doesn't quite reach perfection, at least if you are of a similar mind to me. You might not be. You might be fine with this great couple existing forever in a relationship that is uncommitted to the rest of the world, and between them in the sense that Katsa feels she will always have the freedom to walk away from Po. Ugh, it makes my heart ache to think about it.So, this is the best review I can write. It's so hard to describe my feelings about this book, and I did the best I could. I don't think I can add much more to it. I highly recommend Graceling. It was a pleasure and a joy, and I want to read more by Ms. Cashore."}, {"userName": "Sofii\u2661 (A Book.

And the plot and descripsion the world where the plot developed, I repeat again, has me amazed is fantastic, but anyway it was not enough.\n\n\u201cWhen a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else?\u201d\n\nNot that it detracts to the plot, it is that for me the main character is important and therefore my feelings for her.Another thing that left me unhappy is the romance in the story, I do not like at all, and I am a person of romances, that is, for me is escensial in the plot, but in this book I have found it unconvincing and somewhat forced, I fails to connect with it at all, so I found myself very boring in the love moments, waiting for the action, which had never happened with me before.\nCertainly I want to highlight the creativity of the writer and I say to you that you never have to discard a book by their review although was not as good as in my case because we are all different and this is a great example of that. Read this one has action and a good plot.

The hardest thing about this book is that it COULD HAVE BEEN SO GOOD. I started out loving everything about it and ready to recommend it to everyone. But then it started reading like a feminist/anti-marriage/anti-kids campaign platform (okay - that might be a little much, but you started to feel that the author had an agenda). It was just really disappointing, because I loved the characters so much. Oh well. Also - even though it's considered a YA novel, there is sex in it. Pretty disappointing."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15183738-holly", "userReview": "DNF.This book was not for me. It has a very pretty cover and an interesting premise, but sadly, that is where my admiration for it ends. I really hated this author's writing style. The sentence structure and dialogue felt very juvenile to me -- at one point I checked to see if it was actually a children's book instead of YA. The writing style bothered me the most when it came to scenes involving fighting. The descriptions of the characters' actions were very clumsily written, and I had a hard time picturing what was actually happening. Another issue I had were that there were several elements of the story that seemed silly or far-fetched. I thought the secret council was a cool concept, but I found it extremely unlikely that one of the seven kings wouldn't have heard about it given that it was supposed to be this far-reaching thing that tons of people apparently knew about. What world-building there was in this story felt a bit lazy to me - the names of five of the seven kingdoms are just North, South, East, West, and Middle, with the spelling reworked a little bit (I mean, Wester?). The thing about this book that I hated the most was the bratty, unpleasant, and self-absorbed main character. She's rude to people for no reason at all, and she's incredibly over-dramatic (at one point she hears someone she dislikes say her name from across the room and she throws a temper tantrum and causes a huge scene). Also, was I supposed to see her as an empowering/feminist character because she dresses in men's clothing and shuns everything that's even a little bit feminine? Because for me, thinking something is bad just because it's feminine is literally the opposite of feminism. So, yeah, I really hated this book ."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3735853-sarah", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Nasom", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67824881-nasom", "userReview": "[ Why did Po have to become blind \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22 poor baby  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Meredith Holley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302775-meredith-holley", "userReview": "Yay!!! This was just what I wanted. This was like a cone of shaved ice on a hot day by the pool listening to a mix of one hit wonders. Yay!! I feel like I didn\u2019t realize it, but one of my goals for vacation was to stay up till three in the morning with a fun adventure, and this was just the thing. 3 a.m. read: check!There is such a deluge of young, energetic girl writers, writing women who struggle with their stoicism and strength and have supportive, emotional male counterparts, and I absolutely love it. It is like we hit this stride of girls saying, \u201cHey, sure, I could write a book and tell you how I see the world and what I want from it. Why not?!\u201d And then publishers are publishing them! Wahoo! And, I know you are as little shocked by this as I am, but it turns out that girls do not always see ourselves as emotionally irrational, sensitive weaklings and men as muscly douchebags. And I really like the simple, somewhat symbolic way it looks at the complexity of emotional control and physical violence. I could not be more pleased. Goodbye stupid, boring old propaganda, and hello new, fun counter-propaganda! Huh, now that I've read a couple of other reviews of this, I have to say that I'm surprised by people's criticisms. It seems like many people have taken issue with the fact that Katsa doesn't like dresses and see that as some kind of condemnation of girls who do like dresses. I have to disagree. I love seeing awesome girls like Buffy and Elle Woods, and the girls in Snooki's book, who love shopping and pink and are also smart and capable. But, I don't think it is condemning of girls to show a girl who does not love shopping. While I have to say that Katsa's take on marriage is almost word for word how I see marriage, I don't really feel like Katsa, or any female protagonist, needs to be the definitive image of what all women should be. Some women think marriage sounds awesome, and others don't, and I don't feel like Katsa being wary of marriage because of her resistance to control is a judgment on any of the women in this book or in real life who are in favor of marriage. It kind of weirds me out to see the big reaction to that. I think it weirds me out because I do not care for shopping and marriage sounds awful to me, but most of my friends love shopping and/or are married, and I don't like to think me having a different opinion somehow undermines them. Anyway, I love seeing stories where girls are fun and strong and love shopping and marriage, and stories where they don't, because girls are not all the same about those things. It kind of bums me out to see this book criticized for ideas I feel represent my thoughts and preferences.On the down side, this story is admittedly somewhat derivative, but not in the creepy way that Cassandra Clare is derivative, mostly in a fun way. There is a definite X-Men feel to me about the premise of the story, I kept accidentally reading the heroine\u2019s name as Katniss, the trip over the mountains seemed so Aliens, and the ending is Jane Eyre. But, what awesome stories to borrow from!! Such a great mix.Also, this book knocks the Bechdel test out of the park. Out of the park! Katsa\u2019s interactions with all of the women were so beautiful and humble and natural. I loved them. I had a little bit of Bechdel concern early on because of Helda, but ultimately I think she is a great character, too. It feels natural for me for Katsa to face a lot of pressure to get married and have babies, even from really wonderful friends, because let\u2019s face it, you do. And including the character of Helda gave Katsa such a graceful opportunity to define her own life instead of listening to even someone she loved.Yay!! When I was in seventh grade, I would read books with a couple of friends of mine and say, \u201cIt was sooooooo romaaaaaaantic!\u201d And then we would laugh for like fifteen minutes, the way you do in seventh grade. I can\u2019t really explain it now, but we thought it was hilarious to say that. Or, I did at least. Anyway, this book definitely would have made it on my soooooo romaaaaantic train, but it still presented a really healthy model, in my evaluation, of loyalty and love without control and ownership. Definite swoon. Plus, a guy with tattoos: how can I resist?Also, I loooooooved that Raffin was Katsa\u2019s sassy gay friend! Because girl needed one, and he was so great at it! And he totally was her sassy gay friend; don\u2019t tell me otherwise. But, what a subtle, wonderful way to show a loving, sweet gay couple without sort of exploiting them for PC points. I think, anyway. I mean, I know the book didn\u2019t dive fully into what it would mean for Raffin to have to get married, and it would have been great to be more explicit about it, but I still think it showed them really sweetly.While I have to say that I love Blood Red Road more than this, and I think this is somewhat comparable to that, I did still love this. I just think the writing in BRR is brilliant and Saba\u2019s voice is so unique. This was more straightforward, and probably an easier read for people who struggled with the dialect in BRR. But, mostly, YAY for all of the messages about women and girls defending ourselves and not bowing to control and emotional manipulation! So smart. I think this book could be to a seventh-grade girl audience what Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is to an adult male audience in terms of messages about confronting hatred of women. And I say again, YAAAAAY!!!!_________________________I received a free copy of this book from the library.
