(It seems Starfleet doesn\u2019t issue condoms)Spock goes back to the planet Sarpedion and using the mysterious time portal meets his 5,000 year old son. Time travel is so much fun, anything is possible, and while this is way out of the realm of what I usually read, I have to say that I enjoyed it. It\u2019s a well written, clever story, capturing the essence of the original series perfectly while giving us a peek into the minds of our favourite characters.The author obviously knows her Star Trek, managing to include mention of several other episodes along the way which will have Trekkies smiling. There\u2019s a good amount of action involved here including a strategic space battle with the Enterprise outnumbered by the Romulan fleet Go Scottie! and some good old fashioned hand to hand combat too. We also get a ton of Vulcan history - is there like a bible of this stuff somewhere? All the characters are represented in one way or another, remaining true to form. Kirk in all his Captainly awesomeness, Bones who is less grouchy then I remember, taking on a more father like role here and Spock who I honestly didn\u2019t like very much. His character is cold, heartless condescending and frustrating. Yeah I know he\u2019s Vulcan and emotionless but he\u2019s also an a-hole. We also get a glimpse of some doomed red-shirts and spend just enough time with Scotty, Uhura, Chechov and Sulu to make it feel like a real episode.Speaking of Sulu, he has one of my favourite lines from the whole book which is only ironic now 20 years later. He and Uhura are discussing how much Zar and Spock look alike \"Have you ever looked into Zar\u2019s eyes?\u201d Uhura leaned forward a little, lowering her voice.\u201cNo--other men\u2019s eyes don\u2019t do anything for me, I\u2019m afraid\u201d Sulu grinned.Ah yes, the science of Star Trek.

It must have been my early teen years, maybe 30 years ago, when I picked this one up at the bookstore. Much of the plot was forgotten, only a few parts stuck in my memory. I\u2019m not sure what ever happen to that copy but when I picked up the sequel through a book exchange site I decided to read it again. I also recently watched the tv episode that the events this book are based upon. So the timing was perfect to revisit a piece of my childhood and my love of all things Trek.This was such a good book. I am probably bias here but I loved this book it is by far my favorite Trek book that I\u2019ve read. Ms. Crispin does an excellent job of capturing the chemistry and personalities of the characters it was exactly like reading an episode from the original series, only better! Better because you get to be in the head of Spock, Kirk, and Bones, you get to read the internal dialog of the characters.As to the plot of this book I was totally engrossed I have never wanted to sit two characters down for a talking to as I did while reading this book. Maybe even smack them upside the head\u2026 I\u2019m glad there is a second book because while I am satisfied with the ending it was so bitter-sweet, I wanted more for these two. Like I said the book read much like the tv series so if you enjoyed the show you should like this book. If you were a fan of Spock then you are really going to love this one!

And I find it difficult to review.In my mind, I have created certain criteria for how a Star Trek novel should read. Do the Seven Wonders of the 60's have accurate voices? Is the story science-y? Is the story fun and exciting? Does it satisfy my hunger for more episodes of this cancelled series? Well, let me tell you, this book nails the voices of the characters, and feels like you're watching an episode of the show back in the 60's--a forgettable episode, though.That isn't necessarily a bad thing. You can only watch \"Amok Time\", \"Mirror, Mirror\", \"Arena\", \"The Enterprise Incident\", \"The Doomsday Machine\", etc., so many times before you go back to \"Charlie X\" because you can't quite remember what happened in it when you last watched it ten years ago. And that's what this feels like: \"Charlie X\", except with Spock in the father role.Give it a read, if you're a Trekkie. You won't hate it.

It was an enjoyable, easy read, and Zar was a sympathetic character. I particularly liked his relationship with McCoy, who he seemed to bond with a whole lot easier than Spock. The relationship between father and son was strained at best, but there wasn't a whole lot of tension because I was expecting the reset button, which arrived on schedule and to obvious effect. However, given that so much of the early story focused on Spock, it was a little strange how he almost moved into the background as the story progressed - Zar was very much the main character for most of the book, with the Enterprise crew as much supporting cast as anything. On the one hand this has made for an interesting character study, but on the other I wonder if a more sustained focus on Spock might have made the story more compelling. Still, I understand there's a sequel, so I'm curious to know how that works out."}, {"userName": "Oleta Blaylock", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2805345-oleta-blaylock", "userReview": "I love any book that has a good portion of the story dedicated to Spock and/or Vulcan. This is the story of the son Spock and Zarabeth had following the ALL OUR YESTERDAYS episode. It is quite a surprise when Spock realizes that he had a son and that he surviving on a planet in the middle of an ice age. While there isn't a great deal about how Spock really feels he is affected much more than he ever has been. It is wonder to watch Zar learn about the Federation and his father. Unfortunately Spock start off like his father must have been with him as he grew up and left for Starfleet. Luckily both men finally come to an understanding of each other. There are a few sad parts to this story and I think that is becoming part of any story involving Spock and his family.It is always nice to read any adventure that involves all the Enterprise crew.

Spock puts two and two together and realises that Zarabeth must have had his son. Kirk and Bones use the Guardian of Forever to time-travel back and find him.Once you get over the very fan-fic esque nature of the premise this is actually a pretty good TOS Trek novel, decently written with very good characterisation.

Well, I never liked the episode it was based on much. It was a (lesser) repeat of This Side of Paradise that didn't make much sense. But the two books that followed were quite good - if you overlook the genetic problem of Spock fathering a child with a woman of another species, but this was his own problem too (I guess back than nobody thought about genetics very much, TV audience were supposed to be stupid anyway). There are a few points that grate a bit, like the telepathic contact between Kirk and Spock in the beginning (what was the point of this? basically none), but it also has a lot of really good stuff.

O livro j\u00e1 havia sido publicado por aqui em 1991, pela pr\u00f3pria Editora Aleph, junto a outros t\u00edtulos da franquia, facilmente encontrados em sebos hoje em dia. No entanto, a melhor s\u00e9rie de fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica de todos os tempos merecia muito mais que isso.Acredito que, impulsionada pelo reboot dirigido pela mente brilhante de J.J. Abrams e pelo sucesso dos livros de Star Wars, a Aleph resolveu republicar Portal do Tempo no seu atual padr\u00e3o de qualidade, com um trabalho gr\u00e1fico excelente; um pref\u00e1cio assinado pelo criador do site TrekBrasilis, Salvador Nogueira; e um gloss\u00e1rio com os termos mais caracter\u00edsticos da s\u00e9rie, \u00f3timo para quem ainda est\u00e1 adentrando no universo trekker.Embora n\u00e3o possua um Universo Expandido t\u00e3o bem desenvolvido e organizado quanto Star Wars, o livro da autora A.C. Crispin tem conex\u00f5es diretas com dois epis\u00f3dios da s\u00e9rie cl\u00e1ssica de Star Trek, al\u00e9m de citar acontecimentos de v\u00e1rios outros em seu desenvolver. Esses epis\u00f3dios que inspiraram \u00e0 escrita de Portal do Tempo s\u00e3o: \u201cCidade \u00e0 Beira da Eternidade\u201d, considerado um dos melhores epis\u00f3dios de toda a franquia e, principalmente, \u201cTodos os Nossos Ontens\u201d.No primeiro, Kirk e Spock viajam no tempo, atrav\u00e9s de um misterioso portal consciente conhecido como Guardi\u00e3o da Eternidade. Eles precisam retornar \u00e0 Terra no s\u00e9culo XX para salvar o futuro das interven\u00e7\u00f5es catastr\u00f3ficas causadas pelo Dr. McCoy que, v\u00edtima de um acidente com um medicamento que o torna paranoico e violento, havia retornado antes ao passado e acabando por modific\u00e1-lo de maneira desastrosa.Em \u201cTodos os Nossos Ontens\u201d, Kirk, Spock e McCoy v\u00e3o ao planeta Sarpeidon, prestes a se tornar uma supernova, para resgatar a sua popula\u00e7\u00e3o. Contudo, eles s\u00e3o surpreendidos com o fato de o planeta estar vazio. O trio acaba descobrindo que os habitantes haviam se transportado para o passado utilizando uma m\u00e1quina chamada de atavachron. Um acidente acontece, transportando Spock e McCoy em 5 mil anos no passado, durante uma era glacial. Nesse meio tempo, Spock come\u00e7a a agir de forma estranha, retrocedendo ao comportamento dos vulcanos primitivos. Ele, inclusive, conhece Zarabeth, uma habitante exilada do planeta, e se apaixona perdidamente por ela. Enquanto isso tudo acontece, Kirk vai parar um per\u00edodo medieval de Sarpeidon.\u201cAcidentalmente, McCoy e eu fomos transportados para o passado, para a era glacial de Sarpeidon. Est\u00e1vamos morrendo de frio, quando uma mulher apareceu e nos deu abrigo. Seu nome era Zarabeth. Ela fora exilada sozinha, no passado, pela a\u00e7\u00e3o de um inimigo. Ficou presa l\u00e1, por um processo especial de condicionamento. Fui... afetado pela viagem. Voltei ao que nossos ancestrais eram 5 mil anos atr\u00e1s. Um b\u00e1rbaro: eu comia carne. E gerei um filho com Zarabeth. Eu n\u00e3o sabia disso, at\u00e9 h\u00e1 alguns dias.\u201dA hist\u00f3ria de Portal do Tempo se desenvolve quando Spock descobre, a partir de ind\u00edcios arqueol\u00f3gicos, que o seu romance com Zarabeth resultou em uma crian\u00e7a. Decidido a salvar seu filho, Spock busca autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o para usar o Guardi\u00e3o da Eternidade e voltar no tempo para Sarpeidon. Ao retornar \u00e0 era glacial daquele planeta, na companhia de Kirk e McCoy, Spock perceber\u00e1 que ter um filho n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 algo t\u00e3o f\u00e1cil assim. Embora seja um rapaz bem-educado, Zar ter\u00e1 que se acostumar com as novas tecnologias de 5 mil anos no futuro, al\u00e9m de se adaptar aos r\u00edgidos costumes vulcanos.E foi justamente isso a \u00fanica coisa que me incomodou durante a leitura. A facilidade e a velocidade com que Zar se adapta a um mundo totalmente diferente do seu, capaz inclusive de realizar c\u00e1lculos avan\u00e7ados em um curto espa\u00e7o de tempo, passa uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de irrealidade. No entanto, entendo que isso faz parte do esp\u00edrito da pr\u00f3pria franquia e que n\u00e3o poderia esperar algo mais desenvolvido em um livro t\u00e3o curto.A situa\u00e7\u00e3o da tripula\u00e7\u00e3o da Enterprise se agrava quando recebem o pedido de aux\u00edlio de uma outra nave da Federa\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma esquadra de naves romulanas se aproxima de Gateway, o planeta que abriga o Guardi\u00e3o da Eternidade, uma arma terr\u00edvel se cair em m\u00e3os erradas. A sua nova miss\u00e3o \u00e9 proteger o Guardi\u00e3o e impedir que os romulanos desvendem o segredo das viagens no tempo. Tudo isso acontece enquanto a tens\u00e3o se intensifica entre pai e filho.\u201cOs costumes de Vulcano s\u00e3o antigos e rigorosos. Filhos como eu s\u00e3o chamados de \u201ckrenath\u201d, quer dizer \u201cfilhos da vergonha\u201d. Os humanos tamb\u00e9m t\u00eam uma palavra para isso: \u201cbastardo\u201d. \u201dStar Trek: Portal do Tempo entrega justamente aquilo que promete. Uma aventura cativante, divertida e emocionante, digna de fazer parte dessa franquia fenomenal. Acredito que a sua hist\u00f3ria daria um filme muito melhor do que alguns que acabaram sendo produzidos.

This story has always stuck out in my memory as one to etch into my brain. There are a few places that I even found myself laughing out loud as her characterization of the main players was perfect, and the humor was right on. I quite enjoyed reading about Spock and his relationship with his son, even though it was not as it would be with a human father and son, but fit in well with the Vulcan philosophy. Kirk and McCoy, the other two main characters in this novel, are portrayed flawlessly and the story moves along at a fast pace. This, in my mind, is a classic good old-fashioned Star Trek story that all Star Trek fans will love. This Star Trek cover is a little deceptive as it shows and older looking Spock and a young looking Zar. But from the reading, you get the impression that he should look like Spock in the original series and his son should look about 28 years old, not 16.

That being said i was pretty impressed,...she wrote the characters perfectly & it was apparent she was very well versed in ST. This was a good story in its own right but the fact that it was a continuation of an episode made it little more fun. Who took me by surpise in this book was McCoy, even though he is not by any means the main character he does play a really strong supporting role that's actually outside of the Kirk/Spock/McCoy dynamic. I'm not a big McCoy fan outside of said dynamic but he really shines here & i definitely gained some appreciation for my least favorite of the Big Three. Until the last few chapters it's pretty much just a one plot story which does cause it to drag a bit.

Spock discovers he is a daddy! The atavachron affected him to the degree that he recessed to the passionate, primitive Vulcan lifestyle prior to that of Surak's philosophical revolution. So what does it mean? He pulls! And, somewhat surprisingly later, when he returns to Sarpeidon, he has a son. Crispin rather beautifully explores Spock's struggle to form a connection with his flesh and blood, pulling us to question whether it was just out of a sense of duty that he went to rescue his son, or whether the stoic Vulcan is actually able to form a visibly emotional connection with his child (because we all know, Spock is most certainley not as unemotional as he claims to be).

Of course the author still has to weave all these elements together and Ann does a great job but this novel is lacking the complexity of her later work but I enjoy it so much I can't bring myself to drop a star:)"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/431213-anne", "userReview": "I haven't read any of these Star Trek spinoff novels, but when I ran across it in a bookstore in Montana, I couldn't say no (heh, supporting America's bookstores can be fun!). Written at about the 6th grade level this wasn't exactly deep and complex, but what it lacked in gravitas it more than made up for in pure fun. Amusing repartee between Spock and Bones? Check! Slashy musings? Check! An unexpected yet delightful Spock, Jr.? (TV shows like Angel could only weep to have a child so charming!) Check! Getting to hang out with our favorite Star Trek peeps? Check plus!I was going to put some tastier quotes in my daily updates, but it read so quickly I finished before being able to do so. Guess you'll just have to pick up a copy for yourself to see what you've been missing (You can borrow mine if you want). Fabulously fun summer read."}, {"userName": "Aaron Scott", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9890867-aaron-scott", "userReview": "While the original five year mission only lasted three years on our TV sets, this left a lot of time unaccounted for that could be added to with novels and comic books. A really nice swift, light read, this Trek novel ties in with classic episodes \"All Our Yesterdays\" and \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" to create a compelling, sometimes funny, sometimes touching story of Spock discovering a son that lives in another planet and in another time.It is odd that the cover shows Spock circa the eighties movies and not as in the series, because this story definitely takes place during the original series time period. It might be it was thought readers would be confused by the other Vulcan being Spock's son, as it is emphasized in the novel that they are not far apart in age thanks to the miracle of time travel."}], "description": "With the help of the Vulcan leader T'Pau, Spock gets permission to use the Guardian of Forever, a portal through time constructed by a long-vanished race, to venture into the past. On another trip into history, on the planet Sarpeidon, Spock had loved a woman who could not return with him to the future, and now Spock wishes to see the son she bore him, 5,000 years earlier. But a Romulan attack on the Guardian's planet could interfere, unless the EnterpriseTM can keep the Guardian out of their hands.", "title": "Yesterday's Son\n      \n          (Star Trek: The Original Series #11)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1992158.Yesterday_s_Son", "average": 3.96, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1191471406l/1992158.jpg", "reviews": 90, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61277.A_C_Crispin", "name": "A.C.
