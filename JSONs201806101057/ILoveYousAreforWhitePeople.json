If I had graphics skills I'd draw a picture, but basically there's two poles: one called \"has a life interesting enough to warrant writing a memoir\" and the other called \"is capable of writing well enough to describe that life in a way that doesn't make you want to stab yourself in the eye.\" Somewhere else I gave examples for the four resulting categories (unique life + good writing; unique life + bad writing; boring life + good writing; boring life + bad writing). I'm not doing that again. What I am doing is telling you that Lac Su is in category 2, which is not the worst but is still bad, and which means that I cannot recommend that you go out and buy this book, or read it on your newfangled electronic reading device or whatever. You could, like I did, get it for free at a book swap because the title is awesome, and then you could slog through as he mangles what should be a harrowing, impressive story, just ruining it with terrible writing, and you could cringe and cringe and cringe. I'm really really glad this book was free, is what I'm trying to say.If you are less of an editor (or maybe less of a bitch) than me, I'd like to reiterate that the story is a fascinating one. Lac & fam flee Vietnam in a hail of communist gunfire, nearly die on a ship, make it to the good ol' U S of A and are welcomed with open arms right into South-Central LA. Lac's dad is a monster, his friends are all gangbangers, and lots of really awful stuff both happens to and is done by him. He just can't write about it.As I've also said elsewhere, I only partially blame Lac for this. Not everyone is born to be a writer! But when you pick up a book that has gone through the traditional publishing process, you have certain expectations that differ from those you'd have for, say, a self-published ebook. Or you should. Or you used to be able to. At this point the lines are all blurring, so what is the fucking point of going to a major publisher anymore? This problem is becoming endemic to the whole industry, and since I work there too, I could definitely talk for a long-ass time about all the reasons this is true. That's another thing I'm not doing that now. But seriously, Harper Perennial, have you guys got any fucking editors left over there? What is going on that no one could help this guy write a book that deserved to be published, especially since he has a story that really does deserve to be told?"}, {"userName": "Josephine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183205-josephine", "userReview": "Being Asian, I took one look at the title \u2014 \u201cI Love Yous Are For White People\u201d \u2014 and took it for granted that it\u2019d be written by a fellow Asian.I don\u2019t really ever remember either of my parents telling me that they loved me \u2014 and when I mentioned this to a white friend, she just looked at me with incredible pity\u2026but, it never really bothered me because, unlike the author of this book, I always fully realized that just because someone doesn\u2019t tell you that they love you, often actions speak louder than words. (Though, his father\u2019s actions leave a lot to be desired and his love in question.)I really wanted to like this book, but it wasn\u2019t really well-written \u2014 and here, I always pit blame on the editor because while everybody seems to think that they can write, not everyone can actually edit well, pushing the author to pare down a story into something that could have actually been really very good.There\u2019s no denying that Su\u2019s childhood was traumatic \u2014 his family had to flee from the Communists (literally running for the rickety boats at the dock and then nearly drowning at sea) and was forced to immigrate to seedy Los Angeles, living in the squalid projects, where Su faced the usual growing pains of any new immigrant.Add child molestation by a cousin \u2014 which was roundly ignored by his mother \u2014 and frequent physical abuse by his father, who suffered from depression, physical ailments and old school Asian thinking\u2026and what do you get? A misguided kid looking for love and acceptance in all the wrong places \u2014 namely an Asian gang.I know this sounds bad, but there were a couple of times in the book where Su was describing something incredibly stupid that he did \u2014 like stealing almost $500 from his parents to fund an obese Mexican kid\u2019s quest to be the top scorer at some dumb arcade game \u2014 and I thought, \u201cOh, Hell, I probably would have beat his ass senseless, too.\u201dDon\u2019t get me wrong: his father sort of sounded like a typical Asian parent \u2014 someone who pressed his kid to study hard and focused solely on getting ahead in life as opposed to nurturing them with constant praise and love \u2014 but the guy also sounded vaguely psychotic. (Especially when he\u2019d fly into a rage and one time held a meat cleaver to his son\u2019s throat and threatened to murder the entire family when Su dared to try and stand up for his mother when her husband started beating her up for not cooking the rice properly\u2026Su\u2019s father dumped the food onto the floor in a fit when he saw this.)On the one hand, the father sounded like a complete psycho, but on the other, I kind of understood where he was coming from \u2014 I mean, in a way, a lot of us understand what it\u2019s like to realize that life doesn\u2019t turn out the way you wanted it to and that it\u2019s actually a constant struggle; some of us are better at dealing with this fact, others not so much. (I think that\u2019s what separates the people who succeed from those who don\u2019t, actually.)And then you have Su \u2014 I know this sounds bad, but if I\u2019d had him as a kid, I would have probably been disappointed too.It makes you wonder about the whole nature versus nurture question \u2014 are we who we are because of the DNA handed down by our parents or do we become the people we are because of our environment?The memoir was a quick read \u2014 towards the end, it almost wraps up entirely too abruptly. You learn the guy gets married \u2014 and I can\u2019t be sure, but I suspect the wife isn\u2019t Asian \u2014 and you\u2019re left wondering: how did Su\u2019s parents react to that, given the father was racist and the mother feared anybody who wasn\u2019t Asian?I get the sense that a sequel is in the works, but I\u2019m not entirely sure if I\u2019ll read it."}, {"userName": "Davina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1670734-davina", "userReview": "The scars still stirs at the tip of his tongue...I naturally get sucked in instantly with immigrant stories/books. But for Lac, his perspective as a child who witnessed the harshest and roughest life circumstances at an early age differed from a typical memoir. We connected. He speaks to his readers. So yes, life as an immigrant child..... Often, our parent's struggles are set in stone, Lac has done so in his book and vividly portrayed the life of his mother and father. However, Lac also bravely, took on a self mission to have opened and expanded ALL OF his own open wounds and lifelong scars through humor and heartache. At every stage of the book, I had to take a moment to regather myself, I was constantly distracted by a sudden longing to want to grab Lac I physically and give him a big long hug and whisper \"I love you Lac\". I love you."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3467154-kim", "userReview": "I found this book completely entrancing. I have little knowledge of the Vietnamese culture so I learned alot through Lac Su's writing. It's hard to imagine the escape the Su family made & what they went through in their journey to this country. As I read, it occurred to me that Pa was largely responsible for the family even getting out alive. He was a strong man, having made his own escape as a young man to Vietnam, then making a life out of nothing. He's a survivor. I really had developed a fondness for Pa in the beginning chapters and it was hard for me to swallow some of the parenting techniques he used later in the book. I keep wanting to make excuses for him, because like Lac eventually understood his behavior, I think I see it too. I do believe that he wanted the very best for his son and that he did love him very much. Though his disciplinary methods were extraordinarly harsh, I can appreciate the values he was trying so hard to instill. Growing up in white suburbia, I sometimes think that we allow too many freedoms and that our children become 'soft'. They don't recognize the value of the dollar, they don't know what true hard work means, they simply don't know how perfect their world is and how rare & lucky they are in comparison to the rest of the world of children. I don't think beating a child or making them feel unloved is the answer, I only say this to defend Pa, whom I believe did the best he knew how. He did, in fact, raise a well educated son, one who has much to contribute to others' lives, and who I believe cherishes his family and life very much - which was Pa's goal, right? It seemed that his harshness created a fear and respect toward him by the family, but in so many ways, this is what kept Lac on the right track. While his friend was robbing and beating his own father, Lac would continue to try to please his father. Lac had his share of misbehavior and stupidity, but he always went home and home seemed to keep him grounded.I'm not sure how I came across this book, I think I read reviews on it somewhere then went and tried to get it at the library. They did not have it so I asked for it to be purchased & surprisingly, the library soon provided me a copy. Now I want to share this story with others and hope that it would touch them as it has myself. I learned so much about misunderstandings in culture and communication...it is unfortunate that we don't grasp each other and learn from each of our differences. Instead, we reject those who are different - all of us - I'm not blaming this on white people - as the book made clear, the Vietnamese had their own fear of white people's ways and chose to stick together. I just think that communication, or the lack of it, is detrimental to our reaching out to one another. The part of the book where the family goes to the restaurant and wants to pay with food stamps totally presents the picture of how communication blocks misrepresent us. It ended up in frustration on both sides with no real resolution. Lac's first day of school in a suit - Pa's intention was to show respect and gratitude for the education his son was to receive. Others laughed at the dress, not understanding the intent behind it. Unfortunately, the teachers or students never had the opportunity to be able to understand as Pa could not communicate his feelings toward the teacher and school. This was an eye opening and unusual book for me. I read it to fulfill a part of a book challenge, otherwise I never would have looked at such a book for myself. I feel enlightened and hope that others will pick this up too. I can see it being part of an educational curriculum on culture. Actually, I wish there were such readings available in the schools because I believe this is a writing that helps bring about an understanding of the Vietnamese culture, something we don't often study, thus do not have the ability to appreciate.Good luck Lac Su on your future endeavors, I truly enjoyed the sincerity and honesty you put into this book of your life."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2450538-louise", "userReview": "I normally wouldn't have read this book, but it was recommended to me by a co-worker who said it was hilarious.

I really liked it!It's a coming-of-age story of a Vietnamese immigrant and the trials he goes through trying to acclimate himself to American and Asian-American culture in the San Gabriel valley.

I'd read some reviews and thought it sounded right up my alley - it is the memoir of a Vietnamese refugee growing up in California. I feel like a horrible person for saying this because it was a very sad story, but it was just so horribly written that I could barely get through it. For a very emotional story, there seemed to be no emotion in the writing. The author went through a lot of emotional turmoil and changes (coming to the US, joining a gang, trying to get out of the gang life) but there was never any insight into the struggles of these changes. Huge events would be described in passing and mundane events described in detail. The dialogue was incredibly unrealistic and the characters changed drastically without any explanation. Even though it is about a topic that I am very passionate about, I didn't feel any connection to the story. And the epilogue, which I thought would have summed up the story and given insight into how the events narrated in the book changed the author was instead an in depth description of the author's night eating dog meat on his return trip to Vietnam. While it was somewhat relevant to his journey throughout the book, mostly it just felt extraneous. I was, in short, very disappointed by this book."}, {"userName": "Hana Candelaria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2114927-hana-candelaria", "userReview": "A fascinating book I never would have noticed had it not been referred by someone who'd commented online about 'Push.' This is the first description of Vietnam-to-US by-boat I've ever read. As eloquently depicted through the eyes of the son [Lac Su, then 5yrs old:], the family of 4 escapes Communist Vietnam under a hail of gunfire, survives the boat ride with 300 people on a 60-footer [their two companion boats perished:], and ends up in East LA where they meet a host of other 'adventures.' This is a rollercoaster read involving the trials of assimilation/fight for survival in a strange land, search for friendship, struggle to please a demanding/abusive father. Many memories of sometimes funny, often sad lessons...from which Lac Su emerges [as seen on back cover:] with multiple degrees, a company of his own, and a fine family.

Being poor means living in rough places, and young Lac quickly picks up on who has the power in school, on the streets, and in the family. Violence plays a large part throughout the book - meted out by Lac's father, neighborhood bullies, and Lac himself. Drugs and alcohol provide an outlet for many disenfranchised youth, and while Lac tries to find his place among various gangs structures.This memoir is sure to put up red flags for teens tottering on the edge of delinquency, and will provide hope, as well, to those already incarcerated. This is a truly inspirational book, written in a style that will appeal to teens and reluctant readers. The F bomb makes many appearances, but not in an exaggerated way - this is the way Lac Su and the people around him really sound.Many thanks to Amy Cheney from Alameda (CA) Write to Read Juvenile Hall Literacy Library for turning me on to this title."}, {"userName": "Iahc", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1119118-iahc", "userReview": "This book deserves all the praise and awards it has received. The story is about a Vietnamese refugee family who come to America, land up literally in Hollywood, and find (at first) the American Nightmare: violence, gangs, poverty, isolation. Yet the author narrates his own travails with such grace, and at times humor, the story is infinitely readable despite many heartbreaking, and at times infuriating, events. Despite the abuse he suffers from his father, a molester cousin, and gangmembers, Lac Su remains a likeable narrator. I marveled at his ability to overcome so much hardship and still retain not only a sense of humor but also a remarkable love for the human race. I know it's a clich\u00e9 to say a book is \"inspirational\" or \"full of hope\" yet I LOVE YOUS ARE FOR WHITE PEOPLE ultimately IS uplifting and hopeful. The writing is cinematic, told in fast-paced scenes. It would make a great movie. (If anyone in Hollywood is reading GoodReads, pay attention to this book!) The book tells a story that many people do not get to hear because too often the children who grow up in harsh environments, victimized violence, and who turn to gangs for the family and acceptance they do not find at home, do not grow up period, much less grow up to get a Ph.D. and write a memoir, as Lac Su has done. This book is about one boy who grew up to overcome the odds against him, but it also reveals how heavily stacked those odds can be against poor young men (and women), and especially refugees."}, {"userName": "Jodie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2974894-jodie", "userReview": "I think I am getting a bit jaded when it comes to memoirs.

Though Lac doesn't hold anything back, there is a lot of emotional and analytical work he leaves to do with the material he introduces. For my own academic work, Su offers new ways to think about what it meant for him to become an American -it cannot be read as an assimilation narrative, though I would argue this is a terrible model to seek out anyway, and lends support to the ideas I am developing about the intermeshing of transnational and global influences which create very specific cultural hybridities-in this case, Hollywood and East Los Angeles. The father is seen through the eyes of both the child and the adult, neither of whom understand Pa fully. Pa, a tiny man beset by illness is terrifying, close-minded and banal, but he is also terrified and insightful. He inflicts painful and enduring wounds and he must have been wounded and damaged. Lac's speculation regarding his father's actions at the beginning of the memoir, though presented as authoritative, are merely guesses about his father's culturally determined beliefs. The Vietnamese diaspora represents a very diverse array of positionalities, and Lac's perspective is underrepresented so I consider it a valuable resource from a sociological standpoint. Though he quite sensibly lists Augusten Burroughs as a literary mentor, Catfish and Mandala by Andrew Pham could be considered an antecedent to Lac's book as it covers similar territory with parental abuse in the Vietnamese diaspora. There is also a masculine theme of individuation through violence which I choose to compare to Frederick Douglass rather than Hegel as only a literary and not a historical analogy. When he defies his father to beat him, I was thinking of Frederick Douglass taking his stand against Covey. In the extensive \"About the Book\" section of this edition, Lac says he was inspired by potential readers. Addressing the reader, he ends with this amazing invitation: \"And if I'm ever given the chance to meet you in person, don't be surprised if I tell you that I love you. I can't seem to say it enough these days\" (11). Lac, I love that little boy you were and I love the person who is in the process of becoming who I believe will succeed in showing your children how to be happy, which requires an experience with sadness according to your father (and I agree), but without brutalizing them. Your book will offer a way for them into your sadness."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83319-christina", "userReview": "Memoirs are tricky.I'm reminded of that time in Fiction I when I read a classmate's story and wrote her out a very thoughtful critique about how the subject matter was potentially very moving but here were some tips on making dialogue realistic (nothing fancy, just the usual tricks of \"read it aloud to see if it flows,\" etc.), and maybe try to make the whole thing flow more smoothly and introduce some conflict. It was a story about a twelve year-old girl whose best friend died: that's it, there weren't really any interesting characters or even a plot to speak of.Then, before I handed in my critique, the author had to read the story aloud in class (a quirk of this particular professor's), and wouldn't you know it, she breaks down towards the end of her reading and the professor had to finish. Turns out she hadn't quite grasped the concept of \"fiction\" and had just written down something that had happened to her. Professor even suggested adding some additional dialogue and the girl said \"But he didn't say that!\" Needless to say, my critique now seemed heartless and I decided against handing it in.Pointless story introduced because, well: I kind of feel the same way right now. This book is much better than the Fiction I incident, obviously. Lac Su overcame some horrific experiences in his youth and I can't even imagine the amount of courage it must have taken to write about some of this stuff. I have nothing but respect for this man as a person. I just don't think it's a very good book. It doesn't flow at all, and the writing is uneven. What on earth happened to the sister Quy, who is barely even mentioned after about halfway through the book? How did he ever achieve any kind of peace with his abusive father? (Social worker note: as a general rule of thumb, it's considered abuse if it's abnormal within the family's cultural context.) I feel terrible even saying these things because clearly I was just privileged to read a very personal story about horrible things that happened to someone kind enough to share the personal story with the world.

The chapters can stand alone as separate essays, but they are arranged chronologically; I can see this book being used in schools and colleges. That being said, it does cover three of the current standard-issue memoir topics: the immigrant experience, the father-son relationship, poverty, and how all three can contribute to the attraction of gang life for young men. I was moved--me being me--by his stories about his experiences in school. One of the professors I work for uses Dick Gregory's \"Shame\" as the topic of one of his assignments. I never fail to be moved by the students who tell stories of the humiliations they endured in their schooldays and I always want to go back in time and make things right for them. I felt the same way here--why couldn't the elementary school be more understanding of Lac and his family? Sigh.Now for the nit-picking. The author points out in his afterword that he stops the book just before he began a new chapter in his life that would affect his future, which made me think, \"hey, yeah, he did kind of stop the story before it got really interesting!\"--I'm not sure if that's the idea you want to plant in your reader's brain. But he also promises to take up his story in future memoirs. Because of the story he alluded to, I do want to read his next memoir, but I admit I feel a little manipulated by the technique. I was also put off by--and I'm sure you're thinking I'm REALLY nit-picking at this point--a comment he made in his \"thank yous\" about getting \"the story on the screen.\" I'm hoping he meant, thanks for helping me get my story on the COMPUTER screen, and not, \"I can't wait til I make my movie deal off of this book!\" because that's really depressing."}, {"userName": "Leonor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7182258-leonor", "userReview": "I love you is for white people By Lac Su \u2013 Memoir One day Lac hugs his father and tells him he loves him, his father answer is simply \u201cI love you are for white people\u201d Drawing for deep within him, in order to transcend his limitations he needs to create a better life for himself.

The adrenaline rush gives way to a flood of other emotions as you learn that that was just the beginning of what he endured growing up. The stories are disturbing and at some points, I had to just stop reading for awhile. It is courageous that the author, only in his 30's, has been able to go back and mentally revisit these relatively recent wounds in such a frank and public way. This is definitely a different kind of voice than the Asian immigrant works I'd read in the past.My criticism is that the book seems to end abruptly. In the discussion of his work, Lac Su explains that there was more that he wanted to tell. I realize memoirs don't have a natural stopping point, since the author continues to accrue experiences, but I wish he would have at least included one more chapter--a glimpse of life at his new school, where it seems that things began to turn around and he had a shift in his perception.

I've known families from other cultures (including European ones) who did not say \"I love you.\" The chapter in which the title is explained is so painful, I wished I could give Lac a hug--or give *any* kid a hug who's going through that kind of isolation.If your edition has the \"P.S.\" section, read that, too--even the part about the favorite songs. His story about Whitney Houston's \"The Greatest Love of All\" is heartbreaking.Like most memoirs, this book isn't all sad. Some is funny, and some is gross, and some is educational--one of my favorite parts to read is his reconstruction of the events that catapulted his family out of Vietnam. I would like to read more about that part of our national and world history.I am bummed that he counts among his greatest inspirations the memoirist Augusten Burroughs. I think Burroughs is a fine satirist and I love his novel Sellevision. And I enjoyed his first memoir the first time I read it. But on re-reading it, I became unconvinced that it was truthful, and I've been unable to enjoy his memoirs since then. Burroughs seems to have come out favorably in the lawsuit that alleged his work was phony, but I never got over the sense that he was making stuff up--stuff that hurt people. I did not get that same sense from Su's book, but I was disappointed that he views Burroughs' work uncritically.I don't question the major facts of the book, but a detail that rang a bit false was his caricature of a white person who helped him after he'd been beaten up. He was trying to portray the guy as corny. I don't doubt that the guy had that corniness about him, nor that Lac picked up on it in the moment because of his precocious street wisdom. But the dialog he gave the guy to illustrate the corniness rang false. I don't expect a memoirist to accurately recreate dialog from 20 or 30 years ago. But the stuff one makes up to fill in the blanks should ring true. Bad dialog in a memoir is like a bad line in a movie. It takes you out of the story.Also, a minor quibble that says more about the editing than about Su: I'm not the kind of reader who looks for this kind of thing, but I noticed two mis-spelled homonyms. (\"Peak\" instead of \"peek\" and \"pour\" instead of \"pore.\") His publisher should have treated this story with the respect it deserves and fixed these minor but distracting mistakes.Big ups to Lac Su for creating a happy life and for chronicling the sadness and danger that preceded the happiness."}, {"userName": "Erica Kan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37650225-erica-kan", "userReview": "After reading I Love Yous Are for White People by Lac Su, I felt a need to tell my family and friends that I love them. I usually read books that are positive and happy, but this was an exception. Some of the events that happened in the story felt and sounded unimaginable. It felt surreal reading about a cousin who crosses the line of your comfort zone or about uncles who catch live ducks to eat. This book helped me become more open minded to different cultures and their perspective of love. While I was reading this book I felt sympathy, anger, and motivation for Lac. I thought his relationship with his father and the pain from it was unacceptable. I felt anger because no child deserves to be beaten and should be told that they\u2019re loved. But, I also cheered Lac on for enduring his father\u2019s physical abuse and hoped that there would be a resolution towards the end of the book.  The book\u2019s strengths are the dialogue between Pa and Lac and the main events that occur in each chapter. They showcase the way Pa talks and acts around his family and how it impacts Lac. The dialogue made me feel like I was a bystander of the scene. The book does not have any weaknesses. I would recommend this book to a friend or a student of high school level or higher. A middle schooler might not understand the book as well as a high schooler and the content could be too overwhelming. Depending on a middle schooler\u2019s level of maturity and knowledge, I don\u2019t think they would understand what Lac\u2019s toy actually was in Chapter 2. For a friend I think they would find the events in this book funny and inspirational. I also feel like an adult would understand this book depending on their culture and where they came from. Due to a person\u2019s experiences, they can either relate to Lac and empathize with him or try to understand his life. I think that even if you like or don\u2019t like this book you will learn something and take away lessons from it."}, {"userName": "Angel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23267775-angel", "userReview": "I'm white and not an immigrant, but I still connected with the book in some ways. It took me back to my college years when I lived with and was often surrounded by Vietnamese friends. I started missing the sound of the language and craving rice, summer rolls, fish sauce, and even pickled eggplant. Surprisingly I don't think he ever eats pho^ in the book. Some of the other dishes he eats- intestines, tripe, and even dog- inspired more of a \"um, no thanks\" from my tummy. I connected to more than just the food- but it's dinnertime and my stomach is grumbly.It's a very sad book. Lac endures a lot of hunger, frustration, and anger. As a child he learns English quicker than his parents, leaving him the translator when, for example, his dad tries to pay for the family's dinner at a restuarant in food stamps (which they don't accept). \"My life still centers around a tiny man\"... his dad plays a central, if painful and unstable, role in his life. He strives to be the son his father wants, to get the good grades so he can get into college, etc. The whole while he feels isolated, looking for the love his father won't show in peers, art, and a number of vices. It's hard being a teen, being an immigrant one seems tougher.Though the book was a quick read, it was at times confusing and difficult to read. It seems he just strung together memories from different points in his life. That would be fine except he doesn't segue between them- he'll recount memories of his family living in a studio apartment and start talking about his dad learning to drive in the lane in front of the house... 3 or 4 paragraphs in he suddenly goes of into a description of the new house and how he moved in/felt about it and then goes back to the car story. I think with a little smoothing and shifting about of paragraphs to create better segues this book would be much easier to read."}, {"userName": "Colin McKay Miller", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/739464-colin-mckay-miller", "userReview": "Sadly, the best part of Lac Su\u2019s I Love Yous Are For White People is the title. Admittedly, it\u2019s a great title, but you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into. It\u2019s about people who aren\u2019t white, right? And if you had to guess what kind of memoir it is, you\u2019d have decent odds of calling it out as an Asian immigration story. The memoir begins with Lac Su\u2019s family escaping from Communist Vietnam. Upon immigrating to Los Angeles, they struggle to blend in to the American Dream. Lac Su\u2019s father is stern and unaffectionate, constantly pushing his son to do better in school. Meanwhile Lac Su wants to fit in as an American, wants to appreciate his Vietnamese heritage (even if he is uncertain of some of the food and customs), but winds up falling in with the L.A. gangs.It all seems so familiar and, unfortunately, played out. I mean, this is what happened to Lac Su, he can\u2019t help if the stereotypes have held true, but frankly, he\u2019s not a good enough writer to rise above the narrative already well worn. Maybe if everyone else hadn\u2019t already written about the same thing, he\u2019d win by default. Doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t enjoy certain anecdotes about clashing cultures, or have enough interest to wish that Lac Su hadn\u2019t just abruptly dropped the narrative about his sexual abuse, but I stumbled upon I Love Yous Are For White People too late to see it as anything other than forming to a memoir mold long since set.

Their relationship is the backbone that connects these short stories together. But for me, it wasn't enough to keep me from being, at times, disconnected and frustrated. Presenting this memoir as a collection of short stories, told chronologically loses its impact, in that there is not a continuous flow. Some chapters are short and to the point and propels the story forward, while others are long and goes nowhere and ends abruptly without a lingering thought. The first few chapters are strung together beautifully and told as a cohesive story that flows from one into the next. I see my own past experiences looking back at me -- escaping Vietnam with my family at a young age, starting a new life in a new country, attending ESL special classes, making friends,I got teary eyed and a lump in my throat. I thought about my own family as I was reading this. I wanted to really really love this book, but in the end I was disappointed. But, congratulations to Lac Su for putting it down on paper, and dedicating it to his father, who is clearly the central figure in life.

I got plenty of I Love Yous amidst a lot of pain so I am not sure if Lac would have wanted that.... His Pa reminded me of my mom in some ways. She was tough, mean and strict in my early days but as our lives got easier, so did she in a way. One thing that struck me is the whole butterfly affect, one or two decisions you make have life changing consequences. If Lac did not get that beating, would he have transferred to the magnet school. People always tell me after they hear my story how amazing it is that I did not turn out like my parents. I still maintain most of that is luck... the right place at the right time! If I had a complaint about the book, I wanted a little more of the transformation story at the end. How did he pull it together? How did it end with the Ratz? Did he ever see Dragon Head again (and what happened to him)? Maybe the needed an epilogue so we could get that closure. At any rate, I'm glad the author shared his story as it is not one I will forget easily."}, {"userName": "Chairness", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7336108-chairness", "userReview": "A very engrossing, moving memoir about Lac Su's journey from Vietnam to PhD-hood that I literally could not put down. Su's prose is paradoxically matter of fact and yet simultaneously emotive, but only a way that adds to us understanding the situation of his life. He threads together numerous memories of his childhood with a bitterness and a tenderness, but in the end he is not angry with the beatings he suffered from his father or insecure about his life affiliated with two gangs and the subsequent trouble that came from that (no spoilers, but shit gets real). Instead of anger Su has a solemn reverence for the childhood he had and makes no attempt to lecture us about how childhood is \"supposed\" to be; we're merely given a string of memories and his take on them. While I initially wished that Su, now a psychologist, would have expanded a little more on what he wants us to take away from his memoir, but as I reflect his memories truly do speak for themselves.

Lac Su is genious. This makes you laugh out loud and cry. It is very reminscent of Augusten Burroughs. The first chapter begins with Lac running through the Vietnamese jungle with his father, sister, and mother. They barely make it out of communist Vietnam alive, and then move to LA. Lac deals with the physical abuse from his father, sexual abuse from a cousin, and the violence and drugs he lives around. He gets himself involved with a Vietnamese gang, the Street Ratz, and ends up stealing and lying as a daily habit. I love this book. It is honest and real. Lac details what it is like to grow up with food stamps, an abusive father, and how it is to live around gangs and thugs. Lac nearly dies a few times in his retelling of his childhood and adolescence. After reading this, I was so much more appreciative of what I have had and definitely count my blessings even more.
