Set in Philadelphia, Lee Cuddy is the invisible girl, vulnerable to any attention that she gets to secure validation of her existence, leaving her wide open to being the fall girl, taken advantage of, and facing betrayal from almost every quarter. She's a thief, professionally expert, a readymade thief that parallels the readymade art of the avante-garde artist Marcel Duchamps. The trajectory of Lee's life feels surreal in the novel, structured like a cubist painting, a puzzle where the pieces feel discordant until they begin to connect. This is a story of love, loss, art, obsession, science and the efforts of Lee to carve her own path, free from shadowy entities with their own sinister plans for her. Lee ends up in a Juvenile Detention Centre thanks to her 'friend' Edie's treachery until she manages to escape. She gets signs that help will come from the Station Master. This brings her to the Crystal Castle where strange happenings and a disturbing photograph of a woman who looks like her has Lee leaving with a stolen object. There are missing young people and exclusive invitation only parties at the Silo where people are dressed up and Lee becomes the 'Bride'. She is the focus of attention of what appears to be a cult group known as the Societe Anonyme, and the 9 Batchelors, including the Priest, Undertaker, and the Station Master. Lee meets Tomi, and goes on creeps in the city at night with him to abandoned sites like the aquarium, and underground places in the city. Trailing Lee is an intense aura of menace, a rising pile of dead bodies, where places of safety prove to be extraordinarily elusive. Lee encounters love, a deeper knowledge of Marcel Duchamps as she realises she is the target of a murderous group obsessed with the artist, his works and driven with the belief that Duchamps had the answers to the deepest conundrums in the universe.This is a beautifully written and atmospheric novel that weaves a compulsive hold on the reader. It weaves a mystery, with art, science and the metaphysical interpretations of Duchamps art pieces. Amidst all this, is Lee, a complex and hypnotic character, forced into homelessness and precarious living as the world crumbles around her, fighting a losing battle to untangle herself from the whims of the Societe Anonyme's batchelors and a blood soaked trail of death that touches those close to her. Augustus Rose has penned an erudite and imaginative debut novel which ensnares the reader with ease. It is hard to believe this is his first book. I highly recommend this to those who like intelligent, imaginative and thrilling mysteries.

It\u2019s a real pickle we got here, folks.Let\u2019s start with the basic plot which is about an introverted teenage girl named Lee who thinks of herself as being completely invisible and unremarkable except for her talent for shoplifting. Lee\u2019s life is derailed when she\u2019s falsely accused of a crime, and eventually she ends hiding among the homeless on the streets of Philadelphia. (That Bruce Springsteen reference was not intentional.) Eventually she finds shelter in an old building dubbed the Crystal Castle run by a strange group of people that Lee soon grows to distrust. When Lee ends up on their bad side she once again finds herself on the run and caught up in a conspiracy centered around the works of French artist Marcel Duchamp.That description makes it sound like this is just The Da Vinci Code, but that really sells the book short and would be misleading because while this definitely has elements of a conspiracy thriller it\u2019s closer to being serious Lit-A-Chur than a genre book even though it also has some sci-fi elements to it. Plus, it\u2019s not terrible. So it\u2019s probably better to compare it to Night Film which is another book that blends some solid real-world thriller aspects with a general tone of uncertainty that makes you scratch your head a lot while reading because you\u2019re pleasantly baffled.The writing is deceptively straight-forward. There\u2019s no real lines that blew me away in and off themselves, but where Rose excels is in creating haunting imagery. Whether it\u2019s an abandoned aquarium at night or a rave in an old missile silo with an inflatable clown head by the entrance or a guy in old-timey clothes riding an antique bicycle down the street you really see these things, and they all combine to help create the aura of mystery that hangs over everything. He also does a very good job of breaking down the visual aspects of Duchamp\u2019s work which ties into his philosophy about the observation of art.Since it isn\u2019t a straight line thriller that\u2019s as concerned with atmosphere as plot there are some points where I found myself wishing that things would move along and that Lee didn\u2019t spend quite as much time on the run and in hiding as she does. There\u2019s one sub-plot in particular that didn\u2019t seem to go much of anywhere other than to provide Lee with one skill that\u2019s critical for her a couple of key points. And in fairness the sense of desperation Lee has is built by these extended periods of her in survival mode.While I enjoyed this quite a bit I also think it\u2019s going to be a real Love-It or Hate-It book that will be impossible to predict how another person might react to. It\u2019s general WTF tone for much of the book leaves a reader on uncertain footing and that\u2019s not everybody\u2019s cup of tea, and the payoff is only going to appeal to some folks, not all. Still, it checked off a lot of boxes for me, and it\u2019s one of the more unique and original things I\u2019ve read in a while despite it\u2019s basic familiarity of starting out as a conspiracy thriller. It\u2019s an intriguing debut novel, and I\u2019ll be looking for more work from Augustus Rose."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13592557-mohammed-arabey", "userReview": "A \u2018Readymade\u2019 Novel..Creative overall.. but with a very ordinary plot..Could\u2019ve used the Conspiracy Theories & Mind-blowing twists here in much better -faster- plot.\nThe Duchamp CodeA young girl became a \u2018ready-made\u2019 thief due to her sad, lonely childhood.Mysterious 1920s-style parties for selective teens....some mysteriously disappear after.....or back with \u2018lost\u2019 behavior..Then our young protagonist \u201cheroine?!\u201d finds herself amidst all that..all by chance..Discovering that she has been watched by some strange mysterious cult or organisation for a long time.And, also by chance, amidst her tragic, bizarre falling apart life, she steals something that made everything more bizarre..A \u2018Readymade\u2019 Art.. by a visionary artist from the early 20th century..Marcel Duchamp.. the inventor of this kind of art..\nThe Readymade Art ;\u201cAn ordinary object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist.\u201d\n\nAnd That's exactly what I felt about the plot..The Plot's very ordinary.. kinda slow -too slow for my taste- It lingered too much on the drama in a slow way.. and kept skipping wide-open-doors for a massive creepy and fast action scenes and potential wilder storylines. The drugs.. the parties.. the strange watchers.. the Darknet....even the whole theories on Duchamp\u2019s works that preceded Einstein\u2019s theories on physics.. which introduced brilliantly interesting.... \u201cThere\u2019s a contradiction in physics that no one has yet been able to solve.

And quantum theory explains with equal precision the workings of the subatomic universe\u2014 photons and neutrons and quarks and all the rest.The problem is that these two theories are incompatible.

Come on.. I didn't see a resampling but in the word 'ready' and 2 pages of her living in van at an old car dumb...And a hint of Orwellian government that never mentioned later but briefly once after the first page...-Her encounter with the creepy parts like the Silo and parties invitations and the weird eyed young girls was drown into the slow pace.Those who has been following her, the strange people ... all that almost came and gone without much explanations or answers.. ir even proper ends..Even the character of her boy-friend-father-of-unborn-child wasn't strong for me... unlike Lee. Then I should be back to the ;\n*** The Pros *** \nAs I said, Yet.. the detailed theories was a good read.. but detailed drama wasn't matching at all..The drama of Lee was too much, so sad.. BUT I won't say that didn't help me feeling more sympathy for her character .. her need of a friend most of the time, her feeling of betrayal...yet she kept caring for her friends and family..And I felt really close to her... felt the anticipations of unlocking the secret why she had been watched all that time... and kinda disappointed after.\n\u201cIt was a book about a man who was hired to investigate another man, unaware that the man he was investigating was himself.

Let me explain!The title is misleading in my option because while yes the main character is in a way a thief, its not a book ABOUT thieves!And the summary does say it is about a young woman plunging into the world of secret society with a dark agenda but it also says that she is a thief and enjoys being exactly that. And while yes she is a thief and she does steal stuff its not at all about that. Its all about -in my option!- rather stupidly done secret society things that make NO sense!I have nothing against secret societies! If you they done well those books can be fantastic!

It is by no means a happy story, but somehow, you still come away from it feeling hopeful for her. Augustus Rose takes Lee, and us readers, on a wild ride in this genre-defying novel. And it\u2019s a ride a recommend you take.The book follows Lee through just over a year in her life. When we meet her, she is a normal-ish 17-year-old high school student, trying to fit in and make friends and stealing/selling drugs to make money for college. But then things take some pretty crazy turns, a betrayal from a \u201cfriend\u201d that lands her in juve, abandoned by her family and, eventually, on the run. Homeless and without friends/funds, Lee thinks she finds refuge with a group of others living \u201cunderground,\u201d but things are definitely not what they seem. Somehow, Lee gets sucked into the world of a hidden society, founded by a group of fanatical men attempting to decode the secrets of a higher understanding, a mix of science and art and alchemy, left behind by the early 20th century French artist Marcel Duchamp. A society that, for some reason, thinks she holds the key to Duchamp\u2019s secrets and seem willing to do anything (literally anything), or go through anyone, to get their hands on her. And she meets a young artist/computer genius, Tomi, who may or may not be involved with this secret society, that nevertheless manages to insinuate himself deeply into her life (and maybe her heart?).This was an interesting mix of page turner and slow-moving plot development. I am not actually sure how else to describe it. I was literally always on the edge of my seat, because you never knew when the next development, or devolvement, would happen \u2013 it was always fast and sudden. But at the same time, I sometimes felt like some of the details (especially regarding the descriptions on the specifics of \u201ccreeping\u201d - the practice of exploring abandoned buildings, \u201cthief training\u201d \u2013 for last of a better term, and some of the art and philosophy discussions) dragged on a little. I\u2019ve taken a whole day between finishing the book and writing this review to think about how to categorize this story, but, as I mentioned above, it truly is unclassifiable. I actually wrote to myself at the beginning, probably through the first third or so, that I got a creepy 21st century Oliver Twist sort of vibe. Then, things started to turn a little more mystery/thriller, lots of danger and looking over one\u2019s shoulder at all times. As we start to learn more about the S.A., the secret society tracking Lee, things turn super theoretical and philosophical and treasure hunt-y (with a Dan Brown sort of vibe, but grittier, gothic-ier, crepuscular - in general, way cooler than Dan Brown). And throughout it all, there\u2019s a heavy air of classic tragedy, with everything that Lee deals with, feeling left behind, let down, unable to trust anyone, and struggling to get by without a home or way to make money. Honestly, I have no idea how the author got all that into one book in a way that truly does fit together. Plus, the amount of research, on such a huge variety of topics \u2013 from juve to alchemy to hacking/the Darknet to Duchamp, just to name a few - is impressive, really.A couple things rubbed me the wrong way while reading \u2013 there were some times where a person, or persons, took care of or helped Lee to an extent that seemed unrealistic to me (not because I don\u2019t have faith in people, but just based on the logistics of the situations). I felt like Lee was able to accomplish things that bordered on too fantastic/lucky a few too many times (like her return to the Silo at the very end, and what she finds there). At times, as I mentioned earlier, I got a little lost in the descriptions/explanations and things slowed down more than I wanted them too. And, though it is, in fact, totally realistic/possible, it just made me sad how alone Lee was at times.However, on a larger scale, there were a lot of things I loved about this book. I think Tomi was amazing, as a character in general and also the way his relationship with Lee was written and developed with time (even after things\u2026changed - *no spoilers*). I loved reading (almost) every scene he was in. And though I don\u2019t know anything about it (so this could be a completely false representation of it), the parts related to the Darknet/Subnet, the characters there, and the various roles it played in the story were some of my favorite parts to read. The way that Duchamp and his art, theories, and followers\u2019 devotion were woven through the entire story was done with great skill. The small things, like the way the title fits in, and how each section is named after one of his works, were nice touches. But it\u2019s the overall feel that it most impressive. It\u2019s the way that the book is focused around his art and the theories (whether true or not), spun around them regarding science and alchemy and explanations for the world that connect everything, and was simultaneously written to match. At one point, Duchamp is quoted as saying \u201c\u2026the artist is \u2018a mediumistic being who, from the labyrinth beyond time and space, seeks his way out to a clearing.\u2019\u201d And that metaphysical outlook seems exactly the inspiration for the way this story was written. The way the author creates that feel throughout the entirety of this tale was beautiful. In addition, you could really tell how much time and effort went into each of the details in this story. There are no ends left hanging or unexplained side storylines. At all. That alone is evidence of the care the author took. But it\u2019s more than that too: everything is tied up very adroitly. A clean ending to a very messy tale.Truly this story defies labels and classifications. It seemed to morph as I read, representing many different genres, existing in a very philosophical, experimental dimension (very apt, really, considering what it\u2019s about).

I enjoyed this book despite starting it at slightly the wrong time\u2014perhaps don\u2019t start a thriller when you\u2019re already struggling to fall asleep. Augustus Rose has woven a wild tale of a cult that wades into brain-changing drugs and prostitution in order to fund their exploration of a deep mystery left to them by artist Marcel Duchamp. Lee is a normal teenager who likes to steal and likes to sell, who raises enough money to send herself to college, but a friend\u2019s betrayal will send her life careening off its path. The baseline of this tale is Lee\u2019s story of reaching, grasping for success, of wanting to go to college and regain normalcy, and the overlay is a cult that for some reason is desperate to have her. The twists never stop coming, and Rose gives Lee a veracity that comes from both her ability to survive anything and her ongoing panic attacks. The characterization is brilliant, tough but complex. Meanwhile, the novel never gives up, despite the grisly and cruel acts of the cult, on the kindness of the human race, demonstrating itself in the people who take Lee under their wings. It\u2019s a fascinating story about so many things, from gaslighting to feeling like you can\u2019t trust a soul in the world, to the staunch determination of a young woman that she will escape, will survive, and will somehow make it through to the end.

Okay, first of all? Plot. Plot plot plot plot. I'm not exceedingly used to such a plot-heavy literary novel, and this one blew my brain for a while. But it's the kind of twisty, tricksy plot that blew my mind more for the intelligence and the amount of research (GOOD GOD HOW DID HE DO THE RESEARCH - Duchamp, obviously, but there were so many specifics of so many different niche specialties that I really had to marvel at the Rose's skill) that had to go into it to make all the pieces of the book fall into place believably.

It takes the works of artist Marcel Duchamp and imbues them with meaning. The puzzle to be solved involves artefacts, experimental drugs, and the nefarious profits to be made from hedonism.Lee considers herself to be invisible. Her dad walked out on his wife and daughter when Lee was seven years old and she reacted by starting to shoplift. This activity developes into a lucrative sideline and gains her the attention of Edie, one of the cool kids in her class at high school. Their friendship makes Lee feel that she belongs.The girls dream of college but Lee\u2019s stepfather points out the costs, unaware that Lee could now fund herself. Her ill-gained money comes to light when she is unfairly blamed for drug dealing. With her future in tatters she eventually ends up on the streets where she encounters The Station Master. His operations are a part of something bigger and Lee determines to help those whose well-being he sacrifices, for motives she cannot yet fathom.There is a link with a rave scene that girls like Edie regard as the epitome of cool. As Lee delves deeper she is discomfited to discover that she has been watched for many years. She has something that the organisation wants, and it is more than her latest light fingered acquisition.Contemporary resources are used to good effect with hackers, the dark web and mass surveillance enabling both sides to hide and search. It was refreshing to have a young female lead able to think and act for herself.The taut and slick writing encourages the reader to keep turning the pages but my interest in the plot waned when I began to understand what the organisation was seeking \u2013 it has been done so many times before. There were false flags that fell by the wayside, threads left to dangle. I wonder if this is to be the start of a series.Although easy to read I felt dissatisfaction with the tale. It started well, but I struggled to maintain interest in yet another secret society operating from within hidden rooms, beyond the law, for age old ends.My copy of this book was provided gratis by the publisher, William Heinemann."}, {"userName": "Cassie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1453376-cassie", "userReview": "4.5 stars.I'm not sure why The Readymade Thief hasn't gotten more attention. This book is so good. Full disclosure, I may be biased, because I'm fascinated by the exploration of abandoned and forgotten places, and a large portion of this novel is set in off-the-grid locations. So this was definitely right up my alley.Lee began stealing at a very young age. After taking the fall for a friend in high school, she's sent to a juvenile detention center, which she escapes from almost by accident. She takes refuge in a home for runaways known as the Crystal Castle, but something sinister lurks beneath the surface. It isn't long before she finds herself on the run, fleeing through forgotten places in Philadelphia while being pursued by members of a secret society who will stop at nothing to claim what they believe belongs to them.This is such a hard book to classify. It's an intellectual thrill ride of a novel with perfect pacing, full of secret societies and unsolvable encryptions and abandoned urban places and art history. It's an enjoyable page-turner, but it's also really smart (admittedly, a lot of the metaphysical discussions went right over my head). But my favorite thing about The Readymade Thief is that its protagonist is brilliantly-wrought; Lee is tougher than she thinks she is, and full of heart. She holds this audacious plot together, and is a heroine I won't soon forget."}, {"userName": "Suzanne (The Bookish Libra)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991422-suzanne-the-bookish-libra", "userReview": "I just finished reading The Readymade Thief and have very mixed feelings about it. Some parts were really great -- in many ways it reminded me of The DaVinci Code except with a younger protagonist. The plot was complex with lots of twists and turns and a huge puzzle to solve, and Lee Cuddy was definitely a protagonist that I could sympathize with and root for since she is clearly an underdog for much of the book. Where I struggled was with pacing and the fact that the book seemed to spend way too much time on things that didn't seem all that relevant to the main storyline. The seemingly unnecessary scenes left me bored several times throughout the novel and I nearly gave up on it a couple of times. I am glad I stuck it out though because the second half of the book reads a lot better than the first half and I thought the ending was very satisfying. For me the first half of the book was probably a 2, but then the second half was a solid 4 so I've split the difference and rated it a 3.Thanks to Penguin First to Read, the author, and the publisher for providing me with an advance copy of this book.

This book has mystery, secret societies and alchemy all rolled into one.Lee Cuddy, a 17 year old runaway, finds herself in the midst of a conspiracy and a secret society. Having spent some time in juvenile detention, she learned to take care of herself and escaped from that awful place and now was out on her own looking for places to stay. She learned from an older man, Mr. Valesquez, how to pick locks and how to figure which houses in town were unoccupied due to families going on vacation and were available for her to stay in until their return. He taught her, also, how to pick out different items in the homes that would be worth stealing and making some money to get her by. She moved around a lot.Lee tries so hard to figure out the many secrets that were out there especially with the artist Duchamp and why so many were interested in his art or whatever.

I did love the first half. I was all set to recommend it to a long list of my friends and I could not stop reading it, read it straight through nonstop for 150-200 pages. Then, it just started to fall apart. The timeline stopped making sense; once you have a character who is pregnant, you can't stretch your plot out as needed to make things happen that you need to happen. Babies come in nine months. Trimesters go by and the body changes. How can you shimmy through an air duct when you're something like 6 months pregnant? So the suspension of disbelief required surrounding Lee's pregnancy and all the other shit she was doing frustrated me. Then there was the issue of it turning into an ekphrastic half-baked dissertation on Duchamp.

She isn't seen by her father, who leaves without a goodbye or even a forwarding address. She isn't seen by her mother, who quickly succumbs to her new boyfriends whims and wishes. She isn't even really seen by her peers, until she becomes useful to them.\"It wasn't that they teased her or ostracized her or thought her weird, but none of them seemed to see her, either.\"All of this invisibility makes stealing easy and she quickly graduates to shoplifting. This readymade ability quickly gives her a reputation and she finds a place in popularity as Edie takes her under her wing.But, easy come, easy go, and betrayal follows when Edie finds her the easiest way out of her own troubles.Lee quickly sees that it isn't just Edie that is quick to dispose of her. Her own mother, guided by Steve, allows her to take the fall, refusing to even give her the money she stashed for her defense. Life in the Juvenile Detention Center is worse than anything thrown at her so far, and a nervous breakdown lands her in the psych ward. But lower security also provides the opportunity for a quiet and invisible girl to find a way out.The Readymade Thief is a novel that is both fast paced and maddeningly slow. This combination doesn't seem possible, and yet it is. Every page is written so that you know something is happening, but you aren't quite sure what. The result is you feel as on edge and unsure as Lee.Once Lee escapes from JDC we are introduced to even more subterfuge and intrigue. We are thrown into the world of secret societies and underground movements. The S.A. parties continue to pop up, inviting her to join their world, except her gut instinct screams to stay away. Fear for her friend Edie, even after her betrayal, compels her to go searching and almost leads to disaster.Tomi, a mysterious young man, saves her and takes her in. He introduces her to life underground, the world of abandoned building hunts and secrets of the Subnet. She wants to trust him but every turn in her life has led to betrayal and lies. Still, it's easy to fall into his earnestness, especially given her connection to him.Lee discovers that S.A., a secret society devoted to uncovering the hidden puzzles and meanings behind the artwork of Marcel Duchamp. She unwillingly and unknowingly finds herself at the heart of their obsession. Somehow they think she is a key to their mystery, even though she has no idea how. No matter where she turns, or what she does, she finds herself a pawn in their games, time and time again. They are always one step ahead, always surrounding her, always controlling the circumstances of her life.This secret society is obsessed with more than just art. They are also responsible for a chilling new drug that leaves its users docile and empty. Creatures willing to do anything suggested with little or no reaction. Unable to take care of themselves, many of them end up in JDC or worse; the Crystal Castle.This book has a lot of layers going on in it. It is easy to get overwhelmed, or lost in the information. You want to keep pushing ahead to find out what is happening, but I found myself going back to reread portions at a slower pace to really understand what was being said. This is a book that needs more than one read through to really appreciate all the detail and nuance written into the plot.One of the examples of the level of detail and intricacy is the title. Duchamp created artworks that he called 'readymades'. Essentially, he viewed art of the time as 'retinal art'. Easy to look at and pleasing to the eye, but there wasn't anything more in depth than that. His response was to take everyday items and make minor changes to them, thus instantly turning them into art. Readymade art.\u00a0The title, Readymade Thief, refers to Lee, already a shoplifter and petty thief, who has been repurposed for the societies use.Usually, reading the line of phrase that uses the title of a book is a quick AHA moment. One that makes sense in terms of a character or event. In this case, the moment isn't written out or explained by the author so much as hinted at. You are led to it, able to uncover it's meaning as you read. I think it's very clever.There is a lot of art history, specifically to the work of Duchamp. I have no idea how much is based in truth and how much created for fiction. Some parts of this history lesson got very confusing for me. It was a lot of information given. Again, I think this is an example of why the book needs more than one reading. There is just so much to dissect at once.Rose manages to pull off quite an elaborate story. There are clues placed at the very beginning that aren't noticed until they are pointed out later. Things suddenly make sense, and the level of betrayal in Lee's life is astounding. Everything in this novel is connected somehow, even if you can't see how or why, you will in the end. The pure genius is that the end answers questions you didn't even know you had.This book will be enjoyable for anyone who loves mysteries and suspense novels. The art history is impressive and I can't imagine the amount of research that went into composing this plot. It's astounding! Weaving the art into a secret society will delight any conspiracy theory lover.Thank you First to Read, Penguin Random House and Viking books for giving me an early copy in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20910065-matthew", "userReview": "It's been documented that famed painter/sculptor/writer/visionary Marcel Duchamp \"wanted to use art to serve the mind\". One can only assume he'd be as satisfied -and perhaps as blown away - as I was with Augustus Rose's thrilling debut The Readymade Thief. And not just because he played a central figure within its twisty, exhilarating storyline. If anything, he'd champion Rose's ability to manipulate a reader's thought process, to test one's beliefs and senses.While I'd hate to pigeonhole a singularly original novel with comparisons to others, it bears mentioning a few The Readymade Thief brought to mind: The Goldfinch, Station Eleven, and Dark Matter, specifically. Elements of this trio are summoned throughout Rose's work, though it never feels like a retread or even an homage. The Readymade Thief stands alongside these aforementioned greats; like them it'll be a novel I'm sure I'll revisit, if not think about for some time.The tale begins in a future state with our heroine, Lee, a pregnant teenager on the lam. It's unclear who she's running from or whom the father of her child may be. What is clear, however, is that she's been through a tumultuous sequence of events. We soon learn of these events, starting with Lee's troubled home life and subsequent rebellion. Along with her innate ability to steal, she and her closest friend Edie procure items for their fellow schoolmates in exchange for cash; the items are at first harmless, but soon requests become less so. Lee & Edie are suddenly the source of all drug trafficking in their high school. This plot line - coupled with Edie's betrayal of her friend and Lee's incarceration because of it - would make for an interesting story, yet it's only scratching the surface. In prison Lee is even more an outsider than she was when free; she has few allies. She manages to escape but has nowhere to go. And this is the point in which The Readymade Thief begins to pick up steam. It's a locomotive until the very end. On the run from the law and her past, with seemingly no hope or future, Lee finds herself caught up within the underbelly of Philadelphia, struggling to survive. She learns of and begins squatting in an abandoned building called the Crystal Castle, overseen by a mysterious figure known only as the Station Master. Her stay starts innocently enough but quickly turns for the worse; through an invitation to a secretly thrown and bizarrely elaborate party, Lee discovers the Castle for what it truly is: an extension of a secret society obsessed with decoding the puzzles that make up the work of - yep, you guessed it - Marcel Duchamp. Fleeing the Castle, fearing for her life, and followed by members of the society who seek her for unknown reasons, Lee finds solace in a hacker named Tomi. Together they set part on a wild adventure to determine the purpose of the society and why Lee is wanted by them. What follows is nothing short of a whirlwind, a confluence of events that left me dizzied in the best possible way.For a story so complex and densely layered, I'm certain I've missed some of the pertinent details. But that's why The Readymade Thief is so special; there's so much within the details it's damn near impossible to grasp during the first read. At time I felt as though I were along for the ride, an invisible cohort to Lee and Tomi's antics, the only difference being our fears - they wanted to find a conclusion to their story, whereas I never wanted it to end.

Comparisons to The Da Vinci Code are unavoidable, but the delinquent youth protagonist and the mystery being science- and alchemy-based rather than about Jesus made it more interesting to me. Rose puts his homeless, pregnant teenage protagonist, Lee, through a LOT - much more than we could expect to believe in the timeframe - and the narrative could have been culled into something much tighter with a better emotional punch. Still, it drew me in more than the first chapter suggested, and I stayed up too late two nights in a row to finish it before my digital ARC expired. I appreciated what must have been years of research into abandoned buildings, the deep web, and the art and conceptual theories of Marcel Duchamp.

However, let me say this the descriptions were an amazing part of this book. I really felt myself \"creeping\" with Lee and Tomi inside those abandoned buildings.

Some of the book is clever and you will definitely learn a lot about Marcel DuChamp's artwork as well as scientific theory. Urbexing is also featured, the Subnet (the author's creation), a secret society and on and on. It's a lot, too much I think. You feel sorry for Lee, but I never really connected to her. I never felt in on the action. I started to when she felt like she was being watched and she didn't know who to trust, but then it turns again to all this string of short term variety of drama and the original terror was lost.
