Living with her uncle since the age of fourteen she has spent those years with him defeated. Having seen and lived the worst that life could possible offer. Sarah's uncle, Dwight, is a horrid man. He's done unthinkable thinks to Sarah to break her and thinks of her only as his property. The things that she has endured in that tin box of a house still sickens me. With the help of her only friend, Miri, she is given the gift of hope.Nathan is on a path of redemption. A few years back he experienced the a horrible situation that he still struggles with everyday. Now he's just trying to focus solely on his sister, nephew and getting back his career in hockey. He lives inside his head and does his best to just stay calm and concentrate. Nathan is sweet as American pie. Due to his sister, Kayla, coming out of an abusive relationship he's learned to have patience and kindness that will just melt your heart.Sarah takes a chance.... With fear in her heart and someone she can finally call a friend, she finds her escape.. She runs.. Sarah starts up in a new town with nothing but hope. She's determined to get the right set of mind to succeed and make a life for herself. Sarah strives everyday for the most simple things out of life. A book.. A meal.. A necklace she can call her own. With the help of her only friend she was able to land a job in a salon. That's when Nathan walks in the door...The chemistry was immediate. Sarah's calm shy behavior intrigued Nathan. He just couldn't stay away. A little awkward himself and not wanting to scare her off he approached Sarah cautiously. Little by little they begin a very sweet loving relationship. After everything that Sarah has went through it was exactly what she needed. But in the back of her head and always casting a shadow is the knowledge that Dwight is out there. He'll never give up trying to find her...I did enjoy the story very much. Like I've been noticing more and more from newly released books this one could of used a good edit as well. Grammatical, spelling, or incomplete sentences splattered throughout the book. I don't like to harp on these things but it would of made the book so much better. Now for the likes... I loved the different POVs. Being able to not only see what was going on in Sarah and Nathan's head but having Dwight's POV was great. Not that I wanted to get into a monsters head but it gave so much more to the story. I loved loved Nathan's patience and kindness. Don't get me wrong he was certainly all man but having that sweet spot just made me like him so much more. Seeing Sarah start to grow and heal was up lifting. A bit naive but what could you expect with the life she lead.Great story and can't wait to pick up a few more title from this author."}, {"userName": "Jami", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1342477-jami", "userReview": "Wonderful sports romance.

Come on he is a goalie!!Nice simple story line that takes you away from the typically romance or erotic novels of just sex... you follow her through as she takes on her new life with the fear of her old haunting her, but she is determined and a strong women. then she meets the goalie, who doesnt really phase her at first as she has no inkly about hockey! I mean come on who doesnt know about hockey... but as the story progresses the love story blooms and you see these two characters fall in love and fight the demons. Just a nice relaxing storyline.Would enjoy more from this author!!"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5809955-nicole", "userReview": "I give it 3-3.5. It was a cute book (obviously not the painful scars she had), but it was a little predictable and cheesy.. Mostly what was cheesy was the dialogue in a lot of places.. It just wasn't natural feeling. 'Oh you've made me so very happy'... Who says that?? I found myself skimming a few places, which is never a good sign, but I had a happy feeling when I finished, so I guess it redeemed itself.."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19625123-jodi", "userReview": "I thought this was a cute book. A wee bit predictable but I really enjoyed her writing and am on to her next book. I loved the characters and how you were let into Dwight's mind as well.

She lives in hell and is subjected to horrible things by her own blood... Her uncle. Although her uncle tries everything in his power to break her spirit every single day, Sarah still maintains her desire to find a better life. With the help of her only real friend Sarah manages to flee to Red Valley and has a job waiting for her thanks to said friend. After a few days in Red Valley, Sarah meets Nathan Connors. Nathan has his own demons that he fights with every day. He is broken just like Sarah is and perhaps that is what drew them to each other. It was satisfying to see Sarah make it. She takes lives on a day to day basis always looking over her shoulders. You see even though Sarah broke free from her oppressor, this does not mean he will let her go that easily. Even though this book dealt with real heavy issues, it only skimmed the surface of it not really delving too deeply perhaps because the book was not that long. You know that Sarah suffered immensely but you only get snips of it. Although they were young, life made them older than they were but there were still actions and decision made that reflected their age."}, {"userName": "Paula  Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1969584-paula-phillips", "userReview": "Sarah has had a rough life that would make many break and others squirm, when she was sixteen she was sold to her Uncle Dwight by her parents in exchange for Heroin.

The pace was good and the characters sweet, the sex scenes were good also but some dialogues were a bit cheesy. The parts with Dwight and his son Troy were like a evil version of Dumb and Dumber.
