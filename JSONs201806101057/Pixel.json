Seriously, how does Isaac Marion do it? I know I'm not the hardest person to please when it comes to books and stories, but it takes a lot for a writer to communicate certain feelings directly to my brain and heart. And this little story did just that.Written beautifully, as usual; and with a message that might be subtle but grand. Loved every word formed by pixels!"}, {"userName": "Kayleigh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7418667-kayleigh", "userReview": "I am in love with Marion's writing. He takes a simple way of life that's normal and changes the perspective of it completely, giving it a voice in an interesting way and creating an intriguing story to go with it, all whilst making it look easy! I believe to be in his mind whilst writing one of his short stories would be a beautiful experience, almost as beautiful as reading one."}, {"userName": "Alex (TheLibraryOfAlex)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29036431-alex-thelibraryofalex", "userReview": "Did I just get feels for a pixel?Yeah, I did.*rings up Pixar to tell them their next big thing is pixels with feelings*This is was a nice short story about a pixel in a computer, and the adventures he's had with the three users of his computer.I quite liked it and thought it was nice and to the point."}, {"userName": "Lia Ung", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31986889-lia-ung", "userReview": "I wonder if Isaac Marion just woke up one day and thought \"What would be the most bizarre narrator to have in a story?'.

It made me realize about sometimes, the littlest things (or people!) are those with the biggest hearts and are the greatest observers. Too bad they always feel like they're powerless or are forced to stay silent because of certain reasons.The last line actually gave me chills. Not sure why but I take that as a good thing :)"}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5613462-jess", "userReview": "This was such a cute short story!
