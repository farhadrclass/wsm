I am truly BLOWN AWAY by how fantastic this story is. I would recommend it to absolutely everyone.CW: teen pregnancy, adoption, foster care system, alcoholismI don't feel I even have the words to express how fantastic this book is. It is touching, emotional, heart-warming and heart-wrenching at the exact same time. Far From The Tree  is one of those books that causes you to have a weight on your chest the entire time you are reading. I cried from sadness and happiness all throughout the novel.

Missed me?(No.)Just yesterday I was telling myself how wonderful my reads have been lately. And voil\u00e0! I have jinxed myself instantly. I tried, I really did. Then I tried some more, because I am familiar with this author, but alas nothing.Nothing. My heart feels nothing. It should be devastated or filled with admiration or, I don\u2019t know, just *feel* something. Goddamn, why can\u2019t you feel something, heart?Now I don\u2019t want my heart to be giving me a heart attack out of spite, so I will stop insulting it. It is what it is. I won\u2019t deny that this is an important book. Three siblings who are reunited? That\u2019s incredible! I\u2019ve seen it on TV many times before, and I\u2019ve read different stories with characters in the foster care system (try One for the Murphys right now!) but I thought I should give this a chance nonetheless.And it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s readable. The story didn\u2019t impress me, and I found the writing dry, and the characters two-dimensional, but I guess I could have finished it if I had had the time, but I knew that by the end of it I wouldn\u2019t be able to give it higher than three stars, and that\u2019s just sad.The author\u2019s choice to write it in the third person point of view befuddles me. Why oh why did you do that, dear Robin Benway? I have read books from her written in the first person point of view and I enjoyed them much more. It would have been fine if it hadn\u2019t made me feel disconnected from the characters. Again, they\u2019re alright, but I couldn\u2019t care enough to imagine myself being in their situation and I try as much as I can to do that in order to understand them better and, again, *connect*.I might give this another try in the future. Or I might not. Anyways, it\u2019s a DNF at 25% for now.

It's a beautiful, thought-provoking tearjerker of a book, a meditation about family and its different forms, as well as the fears we don't share with those we love, and how what we don't say is often more of a roadblock than the things we do.At times this book had me like:\nWhile at other times it had me like:\nGrace is an only child, although she's always known that she was adopted. But shortly after she gives birth to her own daughter while she's still in high school, and gives the baby up for adoption, she decides that it's time to start looking for her biological mother. She more than surprised to find out from her parents that Grace had two biological siblings\u2014an older brother, Joaquin, and a younger sister, Maya, whom she never knew existed.Maya is tremendously outspoken about everything, perhaps because she's the lone brunette in a house full of redheads. Her adopted parents' marriage is floundering, her mother has a drinking problem, and she's always felt the outsider in her family, since her younger sister was born shortly after her parents adopted her. She's not sure what she hopes to find in her biological siblings, but she hopes it brings her security.While Grace and Maya were adopted as babies, Joaquin has spent his life in and out of foster families. Even the times he let his guard and his heart down, he ultimately was disappointed and hurt, so he's determined not to let that happen again, even when the situation looks promising. More than anything, he's afraid that he believes he can hurt the people who care about him, so he's afraid to let anyone get too close, even Grace and Maya.Each of the siblings has their emotional wounds and their secrets, which poses challenges for their relationship but also demonstrates just how much they have in common. Beyond their mutual love of eating their French fries with mayonnaise, and their similar physical characteristics, the three share the fear of telling the people they care about the truth, about letting them see all of their problems, which has resulted in friction with others in their lives. But little by little, they let their walls down with one another and try to help each other face those fears\u2014which is far easier said than done.\"Maya wondered if it would ever be like this with Grace and Joaquin, the ability to just sit quietly side by side, content in the knowledge that no matter what happened with your parents, or your girlfriend, that your siblings will still be there, like a bookend that keeps you upright when you feel like toppling over.\"There is a lot of emotional upheaval in this book, as the siblings deal with their own issues as well as search for their biological mother. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but I'll admit I found their inability to verbalize the things they were afraid of/angry about tremendously frustrating. I know this was a realistic depiction of how people, particularly teenagers, often handle their problems, but to have it be the case with three people at the same time was a bit bothersome.Beyond wanting to shake the characters so they'd finally say what needed to be said, I really enjoyed this book and was tremendously moved by it. It was a very real reminder about the fears and anxieties adopted children and children in the foster care system face, and it also demonstrated how feeling like you belong for the first time can truly make a difference.This is a really well-written book. Benway had an ear for dialogue that was on-target for teenagers without making them sound so much wiser and more sarcastic than their years. I'm always a big fan of books which make me feel while they make me think, which is why I definitely recommend Far from the Tree.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "maymay\u2740", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49148508-maymay", "userReview": "Sap Warning\nI come from a big family and even though at times they can be annoying as heck and other times make me want to jump out of a window, theyre literally my life and I would die without themokay im done my sap \u2013 grossAND THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT FAMILY AND ITS AMAZING AND PERFECT AND SO SPECIAL kermit gets me-\t BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL and honest sibling rep. this was done so sosososooso well-\tTheyre annoying and irritating and you want to punch them sometimes but like they got your back no matter what and damn boi that\u2019s some hardcore loyalty -\tI loved how the book expressed how dysfunctional families can be, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less important -\tDamn im really getting sappy but I CANT HELP IT THIS BOOK MAKES ME LIKE THIS-\tSo much character development-\tSo much multi-layered characters-\tIt feels so bloody real-\tOkay so listen, I cried\u2026.like a lot\u2026its NOT my fault these KIDS, THEY KILLED ME theyre so precious and sweet darling little teddy bears and they hurt my heart -\tI literally had to stop reading more than once just to contain myself bc I was just not doing well with the feels-\tRobin benway is hilarious and I want to be her friend-\tRAFE MY SWEET SUN CHILD, I NEED MORE ON RAFE PLEASE THAT\u2019S ALL I ASK-\tI really really really loved how the whole thing with the mom was handled, wow, you got me robin benway, I was properly surprised-\tAlso this is a contemporary but like benway shooks you up so many times, legit from the first paragraph you will be like !!??!!???!11?!1?!!??!-\tAnd like it deals with SO MANY important and serious topics-\tBut still manages to perfectly balance that with the humour and cuteness -\tThe conversations between the siblings were literally me and my brothers like I relate so hard I had to punch a pillow -\tMaya\u2019s sarcasm/humour tho, girl, yes-\tSo just like please read it because its beautiful and funny and sweet and it hurts so much-\t\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe it now, I know you might not ever believe it, but Mark and Linda are like those training wheels, too.

The narrator was so good -I picked up feelings from every sigh and cough. I laughed and I cried.......( definitely cried with Joaquin once) - I rolled my eyes - with Maya a few times, and was incredibly heartbroken for Grace and Joaquin in different ways. I felt sadness for Maya too - but kinda different - I felt she was a little more resilient. I loved Grace, Maya, and Joaquin. All of them are Permanente Book Friends living inside me!!! I REALLY THINK MOST OF MY GIRLFRIENDS WOULD *LOVE* THESE CHARACTERS - guys too- AND THE AUDIOBOOK IS TERRIFICALLY ENGROSSING!!!Maya kept me laughing. I needed her sarcastic personality- and cherished it for tension relief.

Far From the Tree is an exploration of family, the one you find and the one you're born into. Great concept, right? But I definitely did not guess just how good this would be. A story like this is one that can only succeed based off stellar character work, and my expectations for character work in contemporary is often quite low. But this was so lovely.This book revolves around three siblings, each with their own conflicts. \ud83c\udf39Grace has recently given birth and put a girl up for adoption. Ostracized at school and by her ex-boyfriend, she\u2019s trying to fit in. \ud83c\udf41 Maya is living with divorcing parents and a dysfunctional home situation. And also her first girlfriend. \ud83c\udf43Joaquin is a foster child trying to decide whether to trust his maybe adoptees. And guess what: I loved all three of them. I don\u2019t want to give away much about this book, because it\u2019s one best experienced. But if I were to sum this book up, it feels so personal. With such fantastic characters, the friendship and family element totally stands out. \n\u201cThe older she got, the more human her parents seemed, and that was one of the scariest things in the world. She missed being little, when they were the all-knowing gods of her world, but at the same time, seeing them as human made it easier to see herself that way, too.\u201d\nThis book feels so personal, and so emotional, but also so hopeful. It\u2019s the perfect tone for this kind of story. Would highly, highly recommend.

On a scale of 1 to 10, definitely a 10!Robin Benway is an amazing writer. I could not put this book down. I was reading it at school in-between classes, in the car (which I NEVER do) and I think at one point I actually read while walking. I think it\u2019s safe to say I was obsessed.This is the story of three adopted siblings who find each other at just the right moment.We get three POVs, told in the third person (which I think was definitely the way to go). There\u2019s Joaquin (older child), Grace (middle child) and Maya (the younger child. I love Grace\u2019s character because she seemed very real and non-fictional to me. Maya is the one I relate to because of the sarcasm and the upbeat attitude. And Joaquin is so sweet and lovable, I wanted to wrap him up in a blanket and hug him! The relationship between the siblings is awkward at first but they soon become closer and more comfortable around each other. They each have special traits and qualities that complement the other two. Every time they acknowledge each other as brother or sister, I felt like crying. I never realized how important and personal those words are before now. Not only do the characters have to deal with the stress and emotions of meeting for the first time, but they\u2019re also experiencing changes in their household (a teenage pregnancy, a divorce, among other things). I loved how supportive they were of each other through all the lows and how they celebrated the highs.I\u2019m not sure how much thought went into writing this book but it seems like a lot. The author managed to build each personality individually, include realistic and believable conflict and wrap it all up nicely in just 300 pages. I honestly think this should\u2019ve been longer. I want to see more of their interactions; I want to know what happens with their love interests and what about Grace\u2019s baby? Oh how I wish I knew\u2026(Side note: I was shocked to realize I haven\u2019t read many books involving teen pregnancy. Not sure if YA authors don\u2019t know how to handle the topic or I haven\u2019t looked enough)Overall, an excellent book that I think EVERYONE should read and 100% worth the hype"}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "Okay. First, we must talk about the most important thing, and that is that cover. Holy sh*t that thing is beautiful. Man oh man. I hate myself for reading this as an ebook out of excitement instead of waiting to buy a copy. I\u2019m way too materialistic for this BS.Now we can talk about the actual contents.I first heard about this book because it won the National Book Award for Young Adult Literature, and I was doing a very grown-up blog post for the very grown up college-affiliated blog I\u2019m part of on the best books of the year. (Objectively speaking. Like, awards and stuff. Offering up my measly weird pickings from last year would have been...not awesome.)I was p surprised??? I read Emmy and Oliver by Robin Benway, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Let alone write the National Book Award about! Hahahaha.Anyway. It\u2019s a contemporary and it has a pretty cover and it won a Big Award, so I figured may as well.And that\u2019s pretty much what I got. It\u2019s a contemporary. It has a pretty cover. I see why it won an award. But it just didn\u2019t...click for me.It\u2019s diverse, which I like. It\u2019s a new, unique story. I haven\u2019t read that many books about adopted families, let alone biological siblings adopted into different families. And I did really like the budding sibling relationship between the three! I have a soft spot for siblings.But other than that...I don\u2019t know. I feel like this book is like. The Mona Lisa, or something. I can recognize what\u2019s rad about it from an objective standpoint. It\u2019s nice looking. I would keep it in my home. But it doesn\u2019t make me feel anything.I sound sociopathic now. I didn\u2019t aaaaaactualllyyyy feel nothing while I read this! Their family development is so good. There are emotional moments. But I didn\u2019t connect with the characters that much. They felt kind of half developed to me. Maybe afterthoughts to their plotlines?I don\u2019t know. This wasn\u2019t bad. I don\u2019t not recommend.What I do not recommend is this review!!!

It\u2019s only the second audiobook I\u2019ve listen to till the very end and it\u2019s YA.Here\u2019s what I loved:The Characters \u2013 Grace, Maya, and Joaquin were well-developed characters to love. They\u2019re all basically good kids carrying more baggage than most adults could bear. Some of their baggage is shared and some is very specific to the character.The Story \u2013 There\u2019s a lot going on here but it all blends seamlessly. Themes explored include teen pregnancy, racism, family dynamics, bullying, and behavioral health and substance abuse issues. Yes, lots of heavy stuff! Yet throughout there\u2019s an underlying sense of hope and healing.The Feels \u2013 As you might guess from reading the above, this is a very emotional read. Sadness, despair, joy, fear, etc. All the feels are there! Be prepared for teary eyes.The Writing/Narration \u2013 I can\u2019t speak to how it would be to read this in print but the language was very easy to listen to. The narrator, Julia Whelan did a fantastic job giving each character a very specific voice.The Takeaway \u2013 Far From the Tree is a beautiful story. It\u2019s YA that\u2019s perfect for readers of adult literary fiction."}, {"userName": "Glitterbomb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30307187-glitterbomb", "userReview": "So, I may or may not have shaken the the shit out of this thing and yelled WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!!!

I would recommend it to everyone, I thought it was so heart-warming, but also so heart-breaking at times. Seriously guys, read this! It's one of those books that makes you feel so many things and it takes serious willpower for me not to recommend this to everyone I come across. Once I finished this book, I realised it actually dealt with so many issues and it was done so eloquently. Sometimes when books deal with quite a lot, it can feel either too heavy or too light (light as in when it feels like books just use topics to shock you etc. and they don't actually explore the issue in a proper way). This book perfectly dealt with every issue. Without going into too much detail or giving anything away, I will just say I loved the overall themes of family, love, loss and friendship. Everything just fitted together so brilliantly to create this wonderful book. The characters were all so great. Every main character was so different and refined. I really liked how the book was split into three different POV's because we got to see just how distinctive each character was. They were all dealing with different things and it was just great to see how each of them dealt with everything. Overall, the story was perfect. I did feel like the end was a teeny bit rushed but that was just a minor thing for me. I will say though, that the ending is filled with so much hope but it didn't feel forced, it felt like a very genuine, positive ending. The writing was so good. This was my first book by Robin Benway and I really really enjoyed her writing style. I also felt like this book was written with so much love and care, and books that feel like that are always extra special to read. I would 100% recommend this book to everyone.

She comes to know younger sister Maya, and eventually THEY come to know older brother Joaquin (different father, as he is part Mexican). Grace is being bullied in school because she had a child and thus, to the tormentors, is a \"slut.\" Maya is the requisite (for YA these days) LGBT character with a rapier wit and a mouth that won't quit. Joaquin is the angry young man (cue Billy Joel).All told, it gets a bit old as it heads for the high 300s. And it suffers two peculiar YA problems -- coincidences and \"perfect\" characters (often boyfriends--in this case, Grace's understanding and oh-so-sensitive bf Rafe whose humor looks too similar to Maya's, truth be told).Enjoyable in its way. A bit bloated in its way. Talky in the typical way. And they all live happily ever after *sob*...."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "It\u2019s a perfectly fine feel-good novel about adoption and sibling love, with abundance of compassionate people and HEA for all.

Okay wow this book is beautiful. This story follows three siblings who have been separated - adopted & fostered - when they were younger into different families. It has such amazing and honest representation of family, friends and relationships. I laughed and I cried with this book. It affected me in a personal way as I have a large family myself. It also had a good representation of LGBT, families, foster care, adoption etc etc. This is a story that will most definitely stick with me.I would recommend this to everybody to read.**I am planning to do a reread sometime this year so I can do a full review**"}, {"userName": "Alexis  (TheSlothReader)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36907106-alexis-theslothreader", "userReview": "4.5 starsThis book was so beautiful. It follows three biological siblings as they discover each other. They're all dealing with their own heap of issues and they're all such unique characters. I absolutely loved each of the siblings and I especially loved getting to watch them grow together as people and as family. Maya, the youngest, is a lesbian and I loved how accepting every character was of her sexuality. She felt so authentic and she was hilarious. Grace, the middle child, absolutely broke my heart every chapter since she was dealing with the aftermath of having given up her newborn baby for adoption. Joaquin, the oldest, had such a sad story and watching him undergo a healing process with Grace and Maya's help was so beautiful. This book is a quiet novel that packs such an emotional punch as it deals with family and overcoming the ways in which people have wronged you in order to conquer your past.I didn't give it full marks because there were certain parts when I was invested in some characters more than others, but I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Kate (GirlReading)", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29599654-kate-girlreading", "userReview": "A heartwarming story of family, identity and discovering your place in the world. This the second of Robin Benway\u2019s books I\u2019ve read and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Her writing is so comfortable to read, her stories easy to follow and her characters are undeniably quick to warm to. I throughly enjoyed the multitude of topics this book covered, whilst simultaneously keeping them intertwined but not overwhelming the plot with \u2018too much\u2019. I thought the various relationships explored throughout were wonderful and the diverse cast of characters and their individual narratives were brilliant to read. Overall this was a lovely and unique YA read and one I\u2019d definitely recommend."}, {"userName": "rachel \u2022 typed truths", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17290119-rachel-typed-truths", "userReview": "pls can i read more books like this"}, {"userName": "Donalyn", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/829035-donalyn", "userReview": "I haven\u2019t cried so much reading a book in a long time.

Well, I didn\u2019t read it technically. I listened to the audiobook and it was splendid. Heartwarming, the right tones at all the right places; the narration was brilliant. And I,... it is not easy to point out exactly why I loved it so much. You know the times when you read an awful book and have LOTS to say about it? But then you read a really good book and you just can\u2019t find the words to describe how it felt. Well, I\u2019m there now, and I\u2026 uhh forget it.4.5/5 stars\nTHE PLOT\nGrace is sixteen years old, and she has birthed a child already. She calls her Peach, but her adoptive parents name her Amelia, Millie for short. Grace is depressed after putting her up for adoption. Grace was adopted too, and she couldn\u2019t have asked for better parents. But her grief over Peach leads her to think of HER biological parents. The search leads her to her siblings \u2013 Maya, a younger sister, and Joaquin, her elder brother. Maya is living with her adoptive parents, who are on the verge of splitting up; and her sister Lauren. Joaquin, on the other hand, was put up late for adoption, and due to anger issues in the past, finds himself still under foster care. The three siblings meet and share their woes, supporting one another through thick and thin, and finally go on to find their Mom.Told through alternating narratives of Grace, Maya and Joaquin, the story takes the reader through heartbreaks, laughter, and an overwhelming emotive ride, questioning relationships and human behavior as they go.\nWHY IT WASN\u2019T A FIVE-STAR READ\n\n\u25cf The character development was mazing and all, and the plot in itself was really good and touchy, except the story was a little too predictable\u25cf Everything wrapped up rather too conveniently. I mean, I did like the way it ended and all that, but I wouldn\u2019t say they were realistic. Because it was not.\u25cf Okay, I admit it. This was just my second audiobook, but I really can\u2019t bring myself to rate it five stars, because, it didn\u2019t feel like a book. Uh, I am not saying audiobooks are trashy, they\u2019re really convenient actually, but still I feel I would have LOVED it had I actually read the book. It\u2019s not fair, I know. But still.\nOverall, this book was really well written, \nreally good\n. I never felt bored at any single moment, and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. It deserves the National Book Award, you know. That\u2019s how good it is."}, {"userName": "Maria (Big City Bookworm)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2567068-maria-big-city-bookworm", "userReview": "--I absolutely loved this one.
