I wanted more when I met him in Pushing the Limits, and after reading Dare You To, I just knew he needed his own book and hea. Isaiah hasn\u2019t had an easy life. Living in foster homes, the only family he truly has is his best friend Noah, and Noah\u2019s girl Echo. He had Beth, but now that she\u2019s moved on, it\u2019s pretty much just Noah and Isaiah. Isaiah may look like a bad ass, but looks can be deceiving. He\u2019s actually a really great guy with a heart of gold. He has his tattoos and piercings, he loves to work on cars, he\u2019s loyal to a fault and he\u2019s smart, sweet, and kind. \nRachel Young is from a totally different world than Isaiah. She lives at home with both of her parents and her 4 brothers. Yes, 4 brothers. She is the baby of the family, the \u2018replacement\u2019 daughter. Rachel feels like she can\u2019t be herself at home. She has to hide who she is and what she loves for her mothers sake. But what about Rachel? The constant lies, public speaking and deception cause her to have panic attacks. It\u2019s not normal, not healthy, but Rachel deals. She doesn\u2019t want to disappoint anyone. The only time she feels free, feels like herself, is when she\u2019s on the road- just her and her car. \nIsaiah and Rachel meet at a race. Neither one should be there, and things go bad. They get out together. Both help each other out and develop a sort of friendship. Theres a moment between them, a spark. But with the race going bad and Rachel getting some of the blame, Isaiah feels its best to stay away for a while. He\u2019s only doing it to protect her. When things come to light, Isaiah and Rachel are in it together. He owes her and he\u2019s going to help. Rachel is hesitant about Isaiah. She really cared for him and he just never called, so she doesn\u2019t know how to act around her. Isaiah has other plans...\n\u201cYou can ignore me, Rachel, and you can try to treat me as a friend, but none of that will erase the fact that I think about kissing you every second I\u2019m awake and dream at night of my hands on your body. And it sure as hell won\u2019t erase that I\u2019m terrified by how much I like you.\u201d\nSure enough, the more time these two spend together, the more they start to fall for one another. There are SO MANY obstacles in their way. Dealing with the racing troubles, issues with her brothers and family problems, worrying how her parents would react to Isaiah. It\u2019s a lot for one couple to deal with. But it doesn\u2019t stop them from falling for each other.\n\u201cOne day I\u2019ll get a tattoo for you... I will. It\u2019s what I do. Each tattoo represents the only happy memories I\u2019ve had. And you, Rachel, you\u2019re the happiest.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe this is what happens when you fall in love. On the outside a lighter is nothing amazing, but it holds all the ingredients that can create something wonderful. With a few pushes in the right direction, you can inspire something so brilliant that it pushes back the darkness.\u201d\nThese two just get each other. No matter how different they are, they are perfect for one another. With all the obstacles against them, will their love be able to conquer all?\nThis is one of my all time favorite YA series. They all have the sweetest romances, some broken characters, obstacles, drama, friendship, love... they are just fantastic. I\u2019ve really developed some strong feelings for these fictional characters! A really beautiful story. I didn\u2019t love it quite as much as Pushing the Limits, but I did like it better than Beth\u2019s book. Regardless, they have all been 5 star reads for me! I\u2019m pretty sure Isaiah is my most favorite character from the series, period. I can\u2019t wait for the fourth book to come out, it\u2019s going to be about Rachel\u2019s brother, West. If you\u2019ve met West, you\u2019ve just gotta love him! \n\u201cYou don\u2019t kiss boys. Boys shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near you. Guys only want one thing, Rach, and it ain\u2019t conversation. I should know.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great YA series- pick this one up!"}, {"userName": "Devyani", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6250148-devyani", "userReview": "I'm not much of a gif user, But...IT'S ISAIAH'S BOOK!!!!!!And after that sneak peak in Dare You To....GO AHEAD.

But Crash Into You is everything I wanted and more."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "Isaiah has been a favorite character of mine since book 1. He's got a badass look but the kindest heart and most gentle soul. Crash Into You, written in his POV, made me adore him even more. We get to see what's going on in that hard-to-crack head of his. Having had a difficult childhood in the foster care system, he's developed a rough edge, but to give a big eff you to stereotypes he's positively one of the most generous and loyal person I know (yes I have met him in real life - be jealous! >.<). He doesn't always get the best hands to play with, though, which makes it all the more harder to watch - the more he tries to stay out of trouble, the more it seems to find him. In turn, you get this urgent need to know how everything turns out Right. This. Minute! This book will see a lot of 3AMs! It also brings to light the heartbreaking, but real issue of kids aging out of the foster care system. This is something teenagers face at an age where they have yet to figure themselves out, let alone the harsh world they suddenly find themselves in - most times alone.Standing by Isaiah is the delicate, but radiant car obsessed Rachel. Rachel is a private school, straight-A, good girl type, at least until she decides to drag race herself into trouble. Her innocent nature could have easily been overwhelmingly annoying, but instead she gives the book so much heart and perfectly balances out Isaiah's tough shell. She does come with her own secrets, which she hides from not only Isaiah but her whole family. While it's undoubtedly a sad situation she was born into, I appreciated the lack of an extreme worst-case-scenario that seems oh-so-popular in contemporary fiction - particularly in New Adult. Overall I found Rachel likeable in an effortless sort of way, plus she comes with a handful of brothers to add to an already fantastic cast. As usual, from protagonists to the smallest of roles, every single character is molded with a personality and life of their own. I especially loved Rachel's brothers who are all distinctly quirky and older brother like. Though what stood out to me was how bigger of a role the characters from the previous books had in this one compared to its predecessor. We get longer and more significant glimpses at Noah and Echo, both being fairly important in this story, actually. Beth also makes a few appearances that leads to some developments on that front as well. On the subject of Beth, I'm happy that she and Isaiah didn't end up together. It seemed like the obvious choice from book 1, but after reading Beth's and Isaiah's individual stories it's clear that a romantic relationship between these two would have been a disaster. They need someone to balance their bold personalities out; they would have likely crashed and burned. In contrast, the romance between Isaiah and Rachel is full of sparks and raging chemistry. Not having been a fan of the hot and cold nature of Ryan and Beth's relationship, it was with relief that I found this one drama free in comparison. Don't get me wrong, they do have their share of bumps in the road, and although some of it could have been avoided had they communicated better, it was much easier to emotionally immerse myself in this relationship. One thing about Eric, the \"villain\" of this story, is that I didn't completely feel the fear that he was rubbing off on everybody. Sure he has \"friends with bats\" but this is a 19year old kid that people treat like a mob boss! This was obviously not even enough to steer my rating, but I wouldn't have minded more show of the power he wields.After all is said and done, what may be the best part of the book is finding out it's not over!--An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Lady Vigilante (Feifei)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2551178-lady-vigilante-feifei", "userReview": "[car accidents for BOTH MCs???

Isaiah is the hero I'm most drawn to, and the drag racing plot device has a certain throwback appeal.Unfortunately, when you get to book 3 of a series and find yourself getting frustrated over the same things which frustrated you in the first couple of books, it's hard to overlook that.Frankly, I was bored when I wasn't frustrated. I'm over the poor-bad-boy-meets-uppity-and-or-inexperienced-rich-girl angle. Rachel's issues had me doing a \"who the hell cares\" reaction. I could honestly give a shit about her panic attacks and how she couldn't take care of herself. And she was the youngest sibling of several older, hot brothers who were very overprotective? This fantasy of being the helpless female who everyone wants to protect is also old beyond belief.Let's talk about Rachel, the girl who chose to be who everyone else wanted her to be in order not to further hurt her damaged loved ones. I say : she reaps what she sows. If you aren't going to tell the truth to people out of fear, then you can deal with the fallout and expect me not to care. Maybe he already knows I'm weak.Unrelated side note : who notes about themselves that they \"lazily glanced\" at someone from under their eyelashes? Isn't that something you'd notice another person doing, not yourself?Let's talk about Isaiah, the bad boy who would slip into thoughts and language which seemed to contradict his rebellious image. Examples :She has skin so soft that I worry about damaging her with a gentle touch.The sound of her voice creates a contact high.I've seen roses the color of her lips.Let's also talk about things that I don't like. Eyes softening to liquid silver makes me feel like I'm witnessing a bad channeling of Jennifer Armentrout. NON PARANORMAL people don't have liquid silver eyes. What was wrong with the normal gray Isaiah had before?The continuation of scent cataloging rolls on - in a painfully embarrassing way.I suck in a breath through my mouth to avoid her scent and step back.The scent of the ocean enters my nose and my jeans tighten.The demonization of weed smoking continues. Seriously. Can someone please have a chat with this author and tell her that this isn't abnormal behavior only limited to kids in trouble? How do you write books about kids coming from a sketchy upbringing and not know that a decent portion of the teenage population partakes, even the \"good\" kids? It's not all that different from social drinking anymore.We're three books in and the repetitiveness has me unsure whether I'll continue with the series. West is up next with his book and he already strikes me as the stereotypical bad boy character. I don't know if I want to go there or not.

I know I'm not the only girl who's been pining after Isaiah since Pushing the Limits first came out. And then after his role in Beth's story and his extremely evident devotion to her...I could feel the collective hearts breaking for him, mine included. I was SO looking forward to him getting his happy times. And I'm more than happy with his outcome in Crash Into You. I did have some small issues, but the story itself was gripping and gritty, intense and passionate while retaining an innocence without preachiness that this author is so good at. MY SYNOPSIS:Isaiah, the forgotten kid with loyalty more un-bendable than steel. He has very few friends in life; actually, just one since Beth left. Noah and he are still living together, barely scraping enough money together to pay for rent, often not scraping enough money together for other necessities. But Isaiah is still in high school, attempting to get a job at a fairly prestigious auto mechanic shop after graduation while Noah takes college courses, trying to give his brothers and Echo a better life.Isaiah meets Rachel at the most unlikely place to find a rich good girl: the back streets street racing circuit. Some bad people are involved with this gig, and the moment Isaiah sees Rachel there, he knows she's too innocent to race with the big boys. Being who he is, Isaiah saves the day...and the girl...but now both he and Rachel are stuck in a tough spot. Rachel, because she has some truly bad street thugs after her, and Isaiah because he feels like he owes Rachel his help.In order to get these guys off Rachel's back, they have to work closely together for quite some time, and the attraction between the proverbial bad boy and poor little rich girl comes into play. The Isaiah that he shows the world isn't easy to hide when in close proximity for a long time, and even Rachel's secrets start to come out fairly quickly. But how in the world can they both overcome not only their current circumstances but their social statuses as well? And all the while, Isaiah's missing parent tries to come back into his life via his social worker...after more than a decade of being gone. MY THOUGHTS: My Isaiah and Rachel:I heart Isaiah, so flippin' much! He is my favorite hero of this series so far. He's a bad boy with a heart of gold, and it just doesn't get much more sexy or romantic than that. Not to mention that Rachel doesn't want to change him...no, what she really wants is just to be a part of his life. They both love cars and speed, and despite their differences, they both really, really like whatever is happening between them.Just like McGarry's other two books in this series, I was completely invested in all of the goings on in this book. Rachel's family unit frustrated me to no end, and the way that Rachel was a virtual doormat when it came to them was a big source of frustration for me. I'm wondering how McGarry will make me fall in love with the next up hero, who is Rachel's older brother. Not one single person in her family endeared themselves to me. The way they in turns coddled her, protected her to the point of smothering, and held this immovable authority over this young woman was bordering on crazy. And she continued to let them...up until the end, I never felt vindication or closure there, so this is the point that keeps the fifth star away for me. I will add in some quotes after publication, because this is one uber quotable book! Isaiah goes on my favorite heroes shelf...he is so selfless and stoic and brave, not to mention how steadfast a friend he is. I wish there were a real life Isaiah...he would be mine!ARC provided by Harlequin Teen via Net Galley"}, {"userName": "Shambhawi P.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8936537-shambhawi-p", "userReview": "This is going to be a really short review - especially given the fact that how long I took to actually get on with writing it after reading the book itself.I've still not completely made up my mind yet.The source of my confusion? It's simple:I loved Isaiah. He was undoubtedly the best hero in the Pushing the Limits series so far. Sweet, strong and damaged - all at the same time. I loved him.I hated Rachel. She was undoubtedly the worst heroine in the Pushing the limits series so far. Shallow, stupid and dependent - all at the same time. I hated her.And the plot was fine. Nothing new, nothing exceptional. It was intriguing while reading but nothing really memorable afterwards. Except for Isaiah. Nothing too squeal-worthy or hate-worthy. Except maybe the insta-ish love for the latter point.But Isaiah was amazing enough for me to forgive all the other shortcomings this book may have.

And I liked it, but it didn't blow me out of the water.I'm thinking that either these particular characters just weren't my cuppa, or maybe I need to take a break from the angsty stuff.I should also note that I'm a bit sick of the Good girl/Bad boy thing at the moment.So Rachel has a weird life. Sure, her family has money, but they're beyond strange. ALL of them.Let's start with her oddly overprotective brothers, ok? I've never seen a group (I believe there's 4 of them) of older brothers act like they have nothing better to do than escort their little sister around so that no guy ever speaks to her.A lot of brothers tend to get pissed when guys mess with their sisters. Especially if the guy in question is a douchebag. That's normal. What's not normal is screaming death threats at every male that attempts to talk to her. You would think at least one of them would be on her side, right? But, no.Protectively eyeballing her date...SANE.Acting like a psycho over a conversation between her an a random dude at a wedding...INSANE.Yeah. So I had a problem buying into the over-the-top dynamics with her brothers.Then there's her parents. Years ago they lost their oldest daughter to Leukemia. Very tragic, no? Yes, yes it is.But.In an effort to make the mother happy again, they kept having children until Rachel was born, so that the mom would have a replacement daughter.Wha...?Unfortunately, kids aren't replaceable, so Rachael lives in the shadow of her perfect older sister.Worse, she's expected to speak at charity functions on her dead sister's behalf. Or she was until she started having panic attacks when she was younger. The panic attacks took the form of severe vomiting, and eventually she was hospitalized because she was throwing up blood.Skip to present day, and Rachel is supposedly over her fear of public speaking and panic attacks. Of course, she's not. She's only pretending to feel better about it so that everyone will stop treating her like she's breakable.And now Dad wants her to start speaking at her mother's fundraising events again...so that mommy won't be sad.Again, I felt the parents were overblown caricatures of people, and not realistic enough for me to sympathize with or even hate.To keep Rachel from seeming like she was made out of some boring jello mold, we find out that she loves cars. Reallyreallyreally loves cars.And that's how she meets Isaiah...who also reallyreallyreally loves cars.He protects her when she wanders out of her element and into an illegal street race. Naturally, there's an evil guy who run the race. This same evil guy blames Rachel for selling them out to the cops/stealing his money. And also (naturally), they have to find a way to pay him back...or else!That whole plotline felt like something out of a 50's movie, and I kept expecting them to break out into some sort of a dance-off to settle the score. Or some such nonsense. As the fear for their lives increased, the obvious answer just sat there staring them in the face.Call the cops (who are actively looking for a reason to arrest the guy) and report him for threatening to kill you!But wait. They can't do that. Rachel doesn't want her parents to find out she was involved in illegal street race!Well. That's an awesome reason to get killed by a scummy wannabe mobster. Sorry I questioned your logic, Einstein.Ok. Sorry, I'm making it sound like this book is total crap, but in reality it's not. I didn't have a hard time getting through the story, and there are tons of absolutely glowing reviews out there for this one. New Adult is a genre that thrives on drama and angst, so I'm not going to fault an author for giving readers exactly what they came to the party looking for. So.My personal opinion is that this one was overly...everything. But even I know that my opinion doesn't count for much.

And that fact forced him to cross paths with Rachel....Rachel was the good girl.... She was trying so hard to be the perfect daughter and the perfect sister... You see, her family was strucked by a tragedy before even she was born, but that fact guided all her life... She is sensitive and everyone around her think that she is weak since the panic attacks... But the last two years she is forcing herself to hide the truth from her family and she is trying to be the girl that her parents want... But with what cost????? Her only fun is when she sneak out from the house and drive her car....A difficult evening, two preppy assholes, an illegal street race, a dangerous man, a police chasing, some help to each other and an awful depth bound Isaiah and Rachel forever... Their love got through many waves and from one look to them, everybody could claim that they were like the day and the night. But first of all, they were bound from a common great love of them... They were both love insanely cars... Especially fast cars....\"Jesus, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve met my twin. One glance at her slim figure and I erase that thought. I wouldn\u2019t be attracted to someone I was related to.\"But the most wonderfull thing was that they could see each other souls....Isaiah loved Rachel because he could see the real herself and he was a steady rock that she could count on him... And Rachel saw Isaiah beyond the tatoo... She saw his kindness... after all, he took in his shoulders a depth that wasn't his... The bond between the two of them was so strong...Now, about my anger issues.... I'm still angry with her family... I didn't like the fact that they never saw beyond what they wanted to see... They didn't see Rachel's struggle and every single one of them forced her to do things that was killing her... And all of that, because they want to be calm and their life as easy as possible... I hated that more than everything else... I wanted to break something for feeling better.... I wanted to shake them up... to force them to see the truth that was in front of their eyes... And at the end, when they found out about Isaiah, her father's action was... unbearable and the results was unforgetable.... Oh, God!!! I'm still very mad.... and that's why i'm thinking so much to read immediately the next book, because it's about one of her brothers and i want to see if the things went better about Rachel and Isaiah...."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "3.5 StarsI\u2019ve been a huge fan of Katie McGarry since Pushing the Limits and then Dare to Me so I\u2019ve been anxiously awaiting Isaiah\u2019s story. While Crash Into You wasn\u2019t my favorite of the three it was still a compelling read.When we last left Isaiah he was angry and hurt by Beth. They had been best friends but with Isaiah always hoping for more. Unfortunately, Beth didn\u2019t feel the same. Because he doesn\u2019t want to stay with Beth\u2019s aunt and uncle anymore, Isaiah is now on his own renting a crappy apartment with Noah, but barely getting by. Trying to stay afloat he gets embroiled in a street race gone wrong and this is where he meets Rachel and is completely knocked over: \nGod does exist and he sent an angel in a white Mustang to prove it.\nRachel comes from privilege and wealth and from all outside appearances she leads a perfect life. But if you look closer, she\u2019s quite a mess. She was conceived basically as a replacement for a sister who died of cancer, so she lives in her shadow. Trying to live up to expectations and fill the hole left in her family, there\u2019s no room for the real Rachel, and she suffers panic attacks from all the pressure. Real Rachel loves cars, working on them and driving them fast. This is how she meets Isaiah. Isaiah and Rachel\u2019s lives become intertwined and even though they come from very different social circles, there\u2019s an immediate attraction. Because Rachel has led such a sheltered life she\u2019s socially awkward and very different from any girl Isaiah has met. He finds her innocence and honesty refreshing. There are no games when it comes to Rachel. Isaiah is used to everyone having an ulterior motive or only looking out for themselves with the exception of Noah and Echo, so the fact that Rachel worries and cares what happens to him touches him deeply. The fact that Isaiah sees Rachel how she really is and likes it fills her with joy. In his eyes she\u2019s strong, capable and far from the weakling her family considers her to be. There shared passion for cars just seals the deal for these two and it\u2019s not long before they\u2019ve fallen head over heels. \n\u201cYou can ignore me, Rachel, and you can try to treat me as a friend, but none of that will erase the fact that I think about kissing you every second I'm awake and dream at night of my hands on your body. And it sure as hell won\u2019t erase that I\u2019m terrified by how much I like you.\"\nWith danger, expectations, and self-doubt, Isaiah and Rachel\u2019s relationship is not smooth sailing. However, Ms. McGarry has a talent for writing swoony scenes that make your heart race, and she manages to gift us with these juicy moments often, in between all the drama. Like I said in the outset Crash Into Me wasn\u2019t my favorite of the three and I think it\u2019s partially because so much is going on not any one thing is dealt with in depth. There was the drama of Isaiah\u2019s mother coming back into his life, Isaiah trying to make it on his own, and then we have Rachel with her family troubles and resulting panic attacks. On top of all that Rachel and Isaiah have a street racing thug after them for money. Add in their romance, and I just think there were too many issues to do any one of them justice, even with the near 500 page count. I\u2019m still a huge fan of Katie McGarry. I don\u2019t expect an author to write a 5 star story for me every time, and even with my issues was a very addictive read. I\u2019m still anxious to read anything she writes, and I can\u2019t wait for West\u2019s story next! A copy was provided by Harlequin Teen through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

I mean we have been waiting for Isaiah's story for so long. Boy, finally.Glass: I've been waiting for Isaiah's story... forever. My heart broke for that sweet, tattooed bad boy in the first book, Pushing the Limits.Tanja: Yes, also I'm so happy that we finally see him more than just a tattooed bad boy. He is so more than that. Remember when in Dare You To, Beth broke his heart? I cried so much for him and here I continued to do so. Basically my heart ached for him throughout all three books. Even though deep down you know he'll find his safe heaven, Katie throw some unexpected twists here. But let's introduce Rachel first. What do you think girl? I always wanted to have a huge family and few older brothers, but now I'm not so sure.Glass: Me too, but I think it was more that we were delusional that they would be our big, strong protectors and we'd be little princesses. Well, we know better now. To be completely honest with you, I wasn't the biggest fan of Rachel when I first started reading Crash into You - she looked too dramatic for me and not very convincing with whole fragile good girl/cars lover image. I'm still not one hundred percent sold on that idea, but I got to understand her. But, speaking about Beth, I kind of hated her in this book...Tanja: I wasn't convinced at the start either. But yeah I could understand her, that's for sure. We all want to make our parents happy, I guess. Ah, yes! I wanted to slap her when she started acting like nothing happened. What do you say about Abby, Isaiah's friend? I really liked her and I'd love to see her book too.Glass: Oh, she is my favorite female character in this book - you know how much I love kick-ass girls. I really hope that Katie McGarry will give us her story too, but I think hers would be the darkest book in the series so far. It looks like she had tough life and that she was forced to do a lot of things she didn't want to.But let me tell you - Crash into You has the best first kiss scene ever!Tanja: Oh, hell yes!! It was the hottest and the most innocent first kiss in the world of YA first kisses I've read so far. Even I got goosebumps. I don't think that any kiss after that one was so strong and emotional. But then again we're used to Katie writing emotional and powerful scenes. Did you have any troubles with this book. I've got a few. First one is Rachel's parents. I wanted to slap them both. (and I do respect older people)Glass: Me too. At first I was most annoyed with her mother, but later her father. Even older brothers had few not very likable moments. My biggest problem with this book is the fact that it reminded me too much of Perfect Chemistry series and lot less of previous books Katie McGarry's novels. All that street/ghetto background of the story wasn't quite believable - it felt little bit \"fake\". It's not that I didn't loved this book, I just had impression as if I was reading modern fairy tale about princess and stable boy.Tanja: True that. I loved every emotional aspect of this story but like you said, setting was sometimes off. That's basically the main reason why for me, this book is the weakest in this series. It's still a five star read but Dare You To was more coherent to me. So West's story is next. What are your expectations?Glass: Honestly, not much. I'm not completely sure how long this series will be interesting to the readers. She already gave us stories of three central characters - everything else is just playing on safe card. I think it is time for her to write something completely different, don't you think? But Tanja, we will read sequel! No matter everything I said. Got it?Tanja: I totally agree, Somehow I think Katie should move on and give us something new (but after we get Abby's story). You're the boss, girl. Till then we're gonna reread that first kiss scene. *wink****Copy of this book provided by publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.***"}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "i barely remember this book. i think i blocked it out? i believe i found it cheesy and overwrought and bonkers emotional and just Too Much. so much drama. unlikable characters.from a time in which i had just discovered contemporaries and would pick up any book categorized in that genre.what a loser i was. not anymore, obviously.anyway.bye.(this is part of a project i am doing in which i write mini-reviews for books i read a long time ago.)"}, {"userName": "Jess-i-ca ~Sometimes a Gif Witch~", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8740772-jess-i-ca-sometimes-a-gif-witch", "userReview": "4.5 Stars!I absolutely love this series!

She's quiet and typically a loner. It also doesn't help that she's not your girlie-girl, she'd rather dive under the hood of a car and change the oil instead of shopping at the mall like a \"normal\" teenage girl. Then she meets bad boy Isaiah who brings out the best in her. When they both end up in trouble with a criminal on the streets, they have to work together and end up teaching each other that love is the most powerful force that drives them.Told in alternate point of views from both Rachel and Isaiah, we get to see how strongly vivid and different their personalities and livelihood really is. It's the cliche rich girl meets bad boy story, but it has a lot of heart and emotion. Though the way they fall in love so quickly, I don't really dismiss it because at that age it can happen. I didn't even think it was super cheesy because the two characters thought out the best in one another and that's what real love does. I wasn't a big fan of the overly dramatic torture that both characters went through..it was almost like they weren't ever going to get their happy ending and you know they needed it desperately. I love how there was a big part of the dysfunctional family dynamics at play. No one is perfect, no one is exempt to circumstance and it's fairly evident Katie McGarry was showing this. I also loved how her brothers are like overprotective bears. They really just love her and want to shield her from pain. Not to mention that they're all pretty swoon-worthy themselves LOLOverall, if you're looking for a contemporary, emotional, sizzling, dramatic YA read, pick one of McGarry's books.

Well then, methinks I\u2019m batshit crazy because I just never learn. Even though I\u2019m fully aware that she has many, many fans, Katie McGarry\u2019s books never quite worked for me. I often found her approach to certain subjects too shallow, her characters just a tiny bit plastic and her writing awfully clich\u00e9d. They are, for me, the type of books I can finish in one sitting, and then promptly forget they exist.The same stands true for Crash Into You, albeit somewhat amplified. Despite my lukewarm feelings towards the previous two books, I found myself looking forward to Isaiah\u2019s story. Of all McGarry\u2019s characters, he\u2019s the one I felt had the most potential. But instead of building upon the promising foundations, McGarry turned him into one of those bad-on-the-outside-decent-on-the-inside archetypal romance heroes, thus effectively ruining his character and the overall story for me. Where was the expected depth? Mommy issues and a few false rumors do not a hero make.Back when Isaiah thought himself in love with Beth, I wholeheartedly agreed that they weren\u2019t right for each other. Two severely damaged individuals would always drag each other down, no matter their intentions. But who he got instead wasn\u2019t much better for him, and she was a disappointment for me as a reader as well. I was promised a street racer, and instead I got a skittish, never-been-kissed girl with no backbone and more issues than I could count. So even though Isaiah ended up being as stereotypical as they come, the real letdown was Rachel.With her personality and her will practically smothered by her family, Rachel grew up into a weak, strange girl prone to panic attacks. Her small rebellion, the street race where she met Isaiah, was a once-in-a-lifetime deal, not a common occurrence like the book description led me to believe. There were so many times I wanted to shake some sense into Rachel, make her stand up to her family instead of cowering and throwing up until her throat was raw and bleeding. Their relationship was at times exaggerated to the point of being ridiculous, which is exactly what McGarry usually does and why her books rarely work for me. As always, secondary characters were far more interesting, probably because they haven\u2019t been turned into clich\u00e9s just yet. Abby has a great story to tell, McGarry has hinted at a horrible past that I would normally be excited to explore. My problem is that I don\u2019t trust this author to do it properly, without turning Abby into a textbook teen martyr, a troubled girl only waiting for the right boy to solve all her problems. The next book isn\u2019t Abby\u2019s, however, that dubious honor belongs to Rachel\u2019s brother West.I\u2019ve decided to part ways with McGarry so many times, only to pick up the newest title as soon as it becomes available. This time, I know better than to make such statements. I don\u2019t feel particularly drawn to West\u2019s story, but once it comes out\u2026 who knows?"}, {"userName": "Kassidy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8937622-kassidy", "userReview": "Can I please give this book more than 5 stars?!This is an absolutely take-your-breath-away, tears-streaming-down-your-face, AMAZING read!I love Isaiah and Rachel so much it's insane. I was captivated by their love and how it made them stronger and overcame all of the struggles in their lives. I completely believed that as long as they had each other, everything would work out. This book got super intense and serious and I just felt so pulled in to the story and couldn't help but keep turning the pages. This is the kind of book that you read and all of a sudden you realize you've read 100 pages and didn't even know it. There is never a slow point! I feel like their love is real and they are real. I don't want this story to be over!!! I love the whole car and racing elements, it made it super unique and interesting. Rachel is a very relatable character and I felt like I could relate to her on some levels, and I'm sure many other people can too. I love how Isaiah has a hard exterior, but in reality he has just had a hard life, and wants to be loved. I want to just give him a hug! Both of these characters had to learn what loving someone means, and how to let yourself be loved. Their journey is a beautiful one.That ending almost killed me though, but I love how it turned out and it just made the story so real. It truly shows the depth of Rachel and Isaiah's love and how pure it is.Wonderful contemporary read!!"}, {"userName": "AJ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3143126-aj", "userReview": "After Pushing the Limits completely rocked my world last year, I promised myself that I would read everything that Katie McGarry publishes, and three books later, I\u2019m not regretting my decision one little bit. Crash Into You finally brings the story of Isaiah \u2013 the tattooed, pierced, car-obsessed bad boy that I fell for when I first met him as Noah\u2019s best friend in PTL. At 17 years old he is a true victim of \u2018the system\u2019, he has been moved from foster home to foster home since he was 6 years old, feeling completely unwanted and unloved, and has developed a tough persona to help him survive. After being left broken hearted by the girl he thought he loved, Isaiah is one angry boy, but on the inside, he considers himself broken. But OMG, you\u2019ve gotta love him! Despite his badass exterior, he has a massive heart, is determined to make a good life for himself, and is unwaveringly loyal to those he considers his family. \n\u201cNoah and I \u2014 we\u2019re brothers despite not sharing blood, and Echo became my sister the day she put a smile on his face. They\u2019re my family and I\u2019m going to fight to keep what\u2019s mine.\u201d\nBut to have the life he wants, he needs money, and the only way to get it is to do what he does best \u2013 race cars. A bit of a legend on the street racing scene, he is all geared up to race one night when ridiculously na\u00efve and innocent Rachel rocks up looking for a race of her own. Also 17 years old, Rachel leads a very sheltered life. She is rich and privileged, but has a severely effed up family life that has left her shy and frightened with significant anxiety issues. She lives her life to please others, but secretly cars are her passion, and she craves the excitement of racing in order to have something for herself. When she gets in way over her head, good guy Isaiah comes to her rescue, and the two of them find themselves in a situation where their very lives are in danger and they have to work together in order to save themselves. What follows is a beautifully unfolding love story of two teenagers from completely different backgrounds who are fighting not only to be together, but also to live their lives on their own terms.Oh Isaiah! How I love you! Instantly drawn to Rachel, he is beautifully protective of her, and incredibly respectful, recognizing that she is not from his world. She\u2019s adorably innocent - good, pure, and trusting, and everything that Isaiah has never had, or thinks that he deserves. \n\u201cI\u2019m still not good enough for a girl like her, but she\u2019s back in my life and she needs someone to protect her. I\u2019ll fill the role and absorb as much of her light as I can before she leaves me behind in the darkness.\u201d\nI have found that when you have a romantic storyline where one person doesn\u2019t feel worthy of the other, it\u2019s a very fine line between heartache and absolute irritation, but Katie McGarry does it brilliantly. Isaiah\u2019s battle to recover from his heartbreak, realize and accept his feelings for Rachel and then find the strength and the confidence to act on them is absolutely beautiful. He is understandably wary, but isn\u2019t afraid to let his feelings be known, and the way he opens up to Rachel and gives her his heart is absolutely beautiful. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be without you. I like who I am with you, and I don\u2019t want to go back to who I was before.\u201d \u201cI love you, Rachel. So this will work. No matter what or who stands in our way.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t give you the world, Rachel, but I\u2019ll give you all I got.\u201d\nRachel is an interesting heroine. Her home life is awful, and she has all sorts of issues stemming from that. But she finds that she is different around Isaiah, feeling a connection with him that puts her at ease and gives her the confidence to be the kind of person she\u2019s always wanted to be, and I loved seeing her come out of her shell. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t me. None of it. I\u2019m not the girl who hangs in a bar. I\u2019m not the girl who is comfortable talking to guys. And I\u2019m sure not the girl who leans over the table to be close to anyone. Yet I\u2019m doing all those things and I\u2019m loving every freaking second.\u201d\nShe does have major confidence issues, and that leads to a few moments of regression that made me want to smack her, but I love that once they start to open up to each other, Isaiah is the kind of guy who is going to let her be stupid, and he manages to set her straight. And while the overprotectiveness of her four older brothers is stifling (including the hero of the next book in the series, West \u2013 another bad boy), it\u2019s clear that they love and care for her deeply, and I really liked her moments with them. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t kiss boys,\u201d says West. \u201cBoys shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near you. Guys only want one thing, Rach, and it ain\u2019t conversation. I should know.\u201d He waves off the subject in frustration, then shakes his head as he speaks again. \u201cWhy are we even talking about this? You aren\u2019t seeing anyone.\u201d \u201cAh, hell,\u201d mumbles Jack. \u201cWe\u2019re having the sex talk with my baby sister.\u201d \u201cIs she dating?\u201d Gavin demands of West and Ethan. \u201cShe can\u2019t be dating. Now we have to beat the snot out of some horny teenager. You should have told me this was going on.\u201d \u201cMake them stop,\u201d I whisper to Ethan. Along with the dread of speeches and vomiting, I\u2019m also dying of embarrassment. \u201cShe\u2019s not dating!\u201d West shudders as if spiders cover him. \u201cThat\u2019s just sick, Rach. Don\u2019t talk like that. Ever. Again.\u201d\nWith chapters in alternating POVs, Isaiah and Rachel\u2019s individual stories are really well developed and a little bit heartbreaking. I loved the inclusion of Noah, Echo, Beth, Logan, and even Mrs Collins in the story, and new character Abby is definitely one I hope we\u2019ll see again.But as usual it\u2019s all about the romance, and this is absolutely gorgeous. Rachel is new to boys, and so she just blindly throws herself out there, which is really refreshing. And Isaiah is so incredibly sweet with her - the little grins whenever he sees her, the linking of their fingers, the sweet way he brushes his fingers over her cheeks and steamy kisses in the backseat of the car. It\u2019s a YA swoon-fest, and I absolutely loved it! With all of this intertwined with the complex world of street racing, there\u2019s a lot going on. And although I did find this book really long and a little bit slow going at times, there were definitely a few surprises in there and the overall story is a really beautiful one \u2013 and I loved getting to see Isaiah finally get his HEA. \n\u201cThe way she curls in my arms makes me feel like I\u2019m the hero. I like being her hero. I like the way her eyes shine at me, the way her body melts when I touch her, her soft lips on mine. I love her warmth and every curve. I love her.\u201d\nOh swoon!Loved it \u2013 4 stars."}, {"userName": "J *deep in the heart of Texas*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9072385-j-deep-in-the-heart-of-texas", "userReview": "[stole the money and ratted Rachel out (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11588440-amy", "userReview": "Katie McGarry knocks it out of the park yet again!

I like who I am with you, and I don\u2019t want to go back to who I was before.\u201d\nI love Isaiah and Rachel\u2019s journey, even with the obstacles they have to overcome. I love the way Katie McGarry tells a story. Her writing holds my attention like few can. I become so attached to the characters she creates. I can\u2019t wait for the rest of this series. I hear the next book is Rachel\u2019s brother, West!ARC kindly provided by publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jeanne ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16160718-jeanne", "userReview": "[ So in this one book, they have a gang member chasing them.

It was just too much. I think she should limit herself to one major hospitalization per book! I felt the same way in the last book. It gets to the point where I'm kind of rolling my eyes.

Isaiah the foster kid and Rachel the rich girl. An encounter at a street race ties them together.The main problem I had was although I felt sorry for both characters, I didnt like them. Isaiah has a long list of issues to deal with but I didnt care much about him. Rachel has such a messed up family. I thought I would grow to like her but it never came.This was quite a serious YA book. I thought through the drama I would find a sweet first love romance, but their connection never clicked for me. Ive given 3 stars because despite not liking much, the storyline was entertaining and kept me turning the pages."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10890208-melanie", "userReview": "See more reviews at YA Midnight ReadsThank you Harlequin Australia for sending me this copy. No comepensation was given or taken to alter this review. \n\u201cI love you, Rachel. So this will work. No matter what or who stands in our way.\u201d\nI see a trend going on. Third book syndrome. Where books get underwhelming (Allegiant, Requiem etc). It's not to say that Crash Into You was a complete disaster, but definitely not what I had in mind from such a promising and fun series so far.We start off with two total opposites. Rachel comes from a wealthy family, she gets what she wants. She's seen as a perfect child--but that's not who she really is. Her mother tries to make Rachel a replica of her deceased older sister, Colleen and her overbearing brothers are always protecting Rachel from other people at school, but it feels like it makes matters worse. She also gets panic attacks. Only she doesn't dare to tell her family. Her job is to make her mother happy. And she's getting sick of it. I genuinely believe that I would slip into Rachel's shoes smoothly, empathy her suffocating situation. Unfortunately, I could not. Her constant inner-wallowing about her convoluted family crept underneath my skin. In other words--crazily annoying. Per contra, I loved the intricate family that Katie McGarry constructed. It felt authentic despite the large amount of problems--believable or not--that channelled around.We all knew and fell in love with Isaiah in Pushing The Limits and Dare You To, so when we found out he was to have his own book, no one couldn't wait. And, when I finally got my hands on this novel, I wasn't disappointed. Isaiah's POV was my favourite. He has his struggles but is mentally strong to battle them. With him recently hurt by Beth's rejection of his love and now living with Noah (yes we get some Noah and Echo! Even Beth :D) and reunited with his mum again, he is only just keeping his head above water.My main issue with Crash Into You, apart from my repulsion towards Rachel, was the chemistry. Why? Instant. Love. Angst. No go. However, unlike other romances, Crash Into You still had a convincing relationship, but it fast fowarded too quickly. A build-up between the two would have been much better. Furthermore, I appreciated that there was a plot line going on. I have a huge COLOSSAL love for a plot line other than: he loves me, he loves me not. She loves me, she loves me not.Even though I was not head over heels about Rachel and the romance, Crash Into You was still a very much likable and entertaining novel. Katie McGarry is still on my auto-read list."}, {"userName": "Patrycja", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6852653-patrycja", "userReview": "I was anticipating Isaiah\u2019s story, more than I did with Beth and Ryan\u2019s. From the beginning I was very smitten with him \u2013 I was literally hooked on his \u2018bad boy\u2019 image, tortured past and broken heart. Isaiah\u2019s passion for tattoos, cars and racing is definitely panty dropping, so I hoped Katie McGarry will show her true talent and picture amazing, swoon worthy male that will make my heart beat faster. Partly, she did so. Why only partly? I think I forgot Crash Into You is young adult novel which made me miss steam factor and maturity in characters. I found myslef hoping for 18+ version ;)Despite that, I really enjoyed Crash Into You. For seventeen year old, Isaiah was phenomenal character and I would love to read about twenty seven year old version of him. That would be something off the charts amazing! He totally would steal my heart then. I wasn\u2019t very happy with Rachel\u2019s creation, though. I was hoping she\u2019d be more badass and crazy chick. I thought kick ass girl would be wonderful match for Isaiah. Instead, Rachel is same old good, rich girl that is a fan of cars. Here, I honestly hoped for more. Her family drama was well thought, but few times I wanted to scream and shake Rachel\u2019s brothers and parents. I was shocked how incredibly blind and selfish a family could be.What I did enjoy? I definitely liked the car racing parts. I\u2019m not a fan of mechanics in real life, but I absolutely had fun while reading about it. I think car racers are exceptionally sexy, and McGarry really well pictured them. I also did like Rachel and Isaiah together. Of course, I craved a little bit of sexy times, but still on young adult level they did get pretty hot and bothered without being completely intimate. Overall, Crash Into You is a book I would swoon and melt over two years ago, when I was in young adult phase. Now, I\u2019m kind of one or two levels up, and I miss the maturity and intimate aspects that are pictured in adult romance novels. Yet, I did enjoy Isaiah and Rachel\u2019s story. And I greatly believe that fans of \u2018lighter\u2019 romance books or people who are not comfortable with sexual encounters on the pages, will fall head over heels in love with Katie McGarry\u2019s book."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1609377-kara", "userReview": "\"The tattoos won't wash off.
