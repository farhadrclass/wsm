Julie Klassen creates an ensemble set of characters in the fictional village of Ivy Hill, not too far from London, in the 1820s. Jane Bell is the innkeeper, a young widow who married down socially and now has no idea what to do with the inn that she's inherited. The story alternates between Jane, her widowed mother-in-law, and some other local characters. It's all very reminiscent of The Widow of Larkspur Inn, so if you like that type of book you'll probably enjoy this. It's sweet at heart but a bit predictable (though a couple of plot twists surprised me). The spiritual/inspirational element is also there, but fairly low-key.This novel is the first in a trilogy (I think? maybe more), and while it doesn't end on a cliffhanger, it definitely leaves several major plot threads not tied up. The second book was recently published, and the third is supposed to come later in 2018."}, {"userName": "Aerykah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5920961-aerykah", "userReview": "Slow and steady. That may not sound like a compliment for a book, but I do mean it that way.This isn't a fast-paced, gripping kind of story that you start reading and can't stand to put down until you've sat reading for hours and finally turned the last page with a sense of relieved satisfaction. However, neither is it the kind of slow story that just drags on and on until you simply can't bear to force yourself to read any more. It's... Well, it's kind of like hot chocolate. It's warm and comforting and enjoyable, but you have to sip it slowly, taking it in bit by bit to truly enjoy it to it's fullest.Yeah... that's the best way I can think to describe this book. It's like hot chocolate. Which made it just the perfect kind of book to read on the cold days of late January and early February, eh? ;)I did really enjoy this book. No, I wasn't entirely sure about it at first-- I worried that it might be a bit too slow for my taste, but that worry didn't last long. I was quickly pulled into the story and enjoyed it more and more as it went along.Jane still isn't one of my favorite characters, but she's definitely growing on me. I've enjoyed seeing her character develop and grow as she's started taking possession and charge of the inn. I think she has a lot of potential and I'm hoping to see her grow even more. I really liked Thora a lot. She reminded me very much of Mrs. Thornton in the North & South mini-series. I haven't read that book yet, but I could seriously hear the voice of Mrs. Thornton (played by Sin\u00e9ad Cusack) in my head as I read Thora's dialogue! They are quite a bit alike, I think... Thinking of that, I could sense hints of a few different classics throughout this book. I would just be reading along and suddenly something I'd read would conger and image in my mind from a classic I'd read or a film adaptation I had seen. I rather liked that. :)But back to the characters... I must say I'm still not quite sure what I think of Patrick. I don't like him, I know that. But I just can't decide if I'm supposed to be starting to like him because he's going to turn out to be a truly likable bloke-- or if the author is going to try to make us readers like him just to confuse us and have him turn out to be quite the scoundrel after all. If I am supposed to like him, though, it's going to take a bit more time and effort to get me to that point. I do like Gabriel, though I'm sure we're all supposed to like him even while being slightly suspicious of him. I don't hesitate to say that I'm going to be very disappointed if he turns out to be the scoundrel and Patrick turns out to be....... Well, I've probably already said too much on that subject so I'll say no more. Suffice it to say, as I have already said, that I currently like Gabriel & dislike Patrick. I'll be interested to look back on this after the series has finished to see if I still agree with those statements.By the end of this story, things are really up in the air as far as any romance for Jane is concerned. I mean, she has-- how many?-- at least 3 potential suitors. And, while there's no actual relationship between Jane and any of these men by the end of this book (sorry if I just spoiled anything for anyone!), that's okay. I will be interested to see how Rachel's and Mercy's stories turn out. Rachel's, at least, already seems to be taking an interesting turn. Thora's own personal story turned out to be a bigger part of this book than I anticipated. I do have a bit of a gripe in regards to that... her story seemed to move in leaps and bounds toward the end and I did feel like it was rushed a bit too much, though I suppose that could be explained away in one way or another (ways which I have considered, but won't mention due to potential spoilers).To sum it up (because I'm afraid if I don't stop now, I'll just keep rambling on and on about this book...), I did really enjoy this book, and while it didn't quite make it to my favorites list, I do give it 4 1/2 stars and a recommendation. I think anyone who loves the old classics like Austen, Gaskell, and Bront\u00eb will enjoy this book (and any of Julie's book, really).I received a free copy of this book through the Bethany House Blogger Review Program in exchange for an honest review.

Say what?! Sign me up for every single book please!Well, what can I say? Klassen has once again fully captivated my attention with every single character. I\u2019m so glad this is a series, because I want more! The book is very much a character driven story and I loved it. It\u2019s not her normal story telling style, but I so enjoyed that it wasn\u2019t fully what I expected and the various points of view worked so well for this one.I loved that for many characters it was a journey of them learning to become people they didn't think they could be. I am really looking forward to what\u2019s next, who\u2019s story will continue and what comes next for the people of Ivy Hill!Have you had a chance to read much of Klassen\u2019s books?

Before reading it I had heard that it was different from Klassen's other books, and I agree- but definitely not in a bad way. There is less suspense, but still a good amount of intrigue. The story is told from the perspective of three main characters: Jane, the innkeeper; Thora, her mother-in-law; and Rachel, Jane's estranged childhood friend. There is a wide cast of community members that interact with the ladies, but not too many to keep track of, especially since they are introduced gradually and each is so individual. I loved the steady weaving in and out of the story and relationships and how each flawed character grew and progressed through the challenges they faced. The workings of the countryside inn reminded me of other favorite books with a similar setting (Doing No Harm by Carla Kelly and Jackaroo by Cynthia Voigt) and it was so skillfully represented that I was fascinated by the historical details without being overwhelmed by them. The romance and potential for romance is subtle but definitely an undercurrent. I am so glad I gave this book a chance and am looking forward to continuing the series!

And I'm not sure if the stars just aligned perfectly with my reading mood, but I adored this story. I typically don't prefer stories that focus on several different characters, and I knew this one did, but that didn't bother me in the least. I enjoyed each characters' story, and I liked their different perspectives. Sure, I didn't warm to one of them as much as the others, but that's also because her story wasn't the focus just yet, but will be the focus of book two.Some readers described this story as slower moving, and perhaps that is somewhat true. The story is definitely character-driven, with very little immediate suspense, however, there are still a few mysterious threads. The pace and tone of the story match each other perfectly, adding a sense of realism to the story. The focus is on true-to-life issues, such as widowhood, saving a livelihood, stillbirth, prejudices between the classes, and more. Because the focus is on real issues, rather than unnecessary drama, the story has a heartfelt, genuine feel. For the most part, reading this book felt like a warm, cozy blanket, full of moments of both sweetness and sorrow. The setting is just lovely and winsome. I especially enjoyed learning about the inner-workings of a coaching inn. The historical details about the inn and life in Ivy Hill are just enough without being overdone. The romantic thread is evident but not overwhelming, and while there are several potential suitors, I never felt misled about who I was supposed to be rooting for (like in Lady Maybe), nor did I feel that the either of the ladies were wishy-washy in the emotions (like in The Apothecary's Daughter). The character development is spot-on for both Thora and Jane, and while there is one happy ending, there are also several loose ends that I'm eager to see revealed, in fact, so eager that I've already started book two.Though this story presents a different style than Klassen's previous novels, it is one that works for this reader. Highly recommended to fans of cozy historicals with sweet romances and a vibrant setting. Off to read book two!"}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22090735-christy", "userReview": "I would describe this read as a warm family drama. Three women points of view are written in this novel and I was elated that the mans view was left out. My favorite to read about was Thora a fifty something plain spoken breath of fresh air. Jane came across a little dull for me. I wanted to see courage and fire and a touch of wisdom from her. There is plenty of romance in this book and actually a little more than what I wanted; but I do realize The Innkeeper of Ivy Hill is low romance for most Historical Fiction out there. I was hoping for a more village feel but instead the focus is a lot with Jane. I wanted more humor, wit and eccentrics to read about; instead I had these three women and their love interests at the helm of saving the Inn. This is the first Julie Klassen novel I have been able to actually finish and frankly I found it just too long. It was a nice read though with a slow and subtle romantic pace that I did appreciate. My favorite moment was when Jerome was spoken to. That was the kind of writing I wanted more of.

Brought up as a gentlewoman, Jane was not raised to work, and struggles with maintaining a business. She gets help from her farrier, Gabriel Locke, but little to none from her brother-in-law Patrick. And Jane is beginning to learn that John was keeping secrets from her, financial and maybe worse.As if Jane weren\u2019t stressed out enough, she has to make room for her uptight, disapproving mother-in-law, Thora. Thora\u2019s presence is not entirely unwelcome\u2014she knows this inn better than anyone. But Thora only cares about the establishment. She never liked Jane, and the younger woman suspects that the elder Mrs. Bell wants her to fail.There\u2019s also a hotelier named Mr. James Drake, who just bought Jane\u2019s childhood home and plans to rehabilitate it as a coaching inn to rival hers. But while he\u2019s set up a competition between himself and Jane, James doesn\u2019t want to be enemies\u2026Julie Klassen weaves an intricate web of friendships and courtships forged and sundered and sometimes healed in this novel, the first in a series. The characters and their relationships are very well-developed. Even though Thora garners two suitors and Jane gets three, everyone is so low-key and subtle and English about it that the story never feels like a soap opera.No content advisory included because none is needed. YA and middle-grade readers might find the subject matter dull, but there\u2019s nothing in here that would be inappropriate for them to read. The Christian element of the novel is very discrete and well-integrated; the characters act consistently like Anglicans from Regency England. While marketed as Christian fiction, I can see non-Christian readers who enjoy the Regency genre enjoying it thoroughly.There is an adorable, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it bonus for Jane Austen fans in the last few chapters. Nothing shall induce me to give it away.Are you looking for a cozy historical fiction free of violence, sex, and melodrama? Are you a fan of Cranford, Downton Abbey or Lark Rise to Candleford?

I am so impressed by Julie Klassen right now... Her very first novel Series!The setting of this beautiful country side village is so appealing with all the English charm you would expect from Mrs. Klassen's writing. Though not the pace you would expect, I love how Julie stays true to the time, allowing history to breathe through her stories and her characters. Being Scottish by blood only, I loved Charlie's character. But I could'na say who was my favourite out of the lot. Even the sour characters--or so I thought were sour--I simply adored. Each distinct voice portrayed as real, poignant, determined, exuberant, kind, loving... just utterly attaching themselves to you through their wit, tender embraces, cunningness, depravities and intrigue. Also, something I found tastefully and wonderfully done, was having an older main (side) character. This character we follow heavily and is 51 years of age. I found this to be so refreshing, as well as relatable! The only negative I need to comment on in this book was the drinking. Though I understand this was acceptable at the time, in that era.

It centers on the Inn that is at the heart of a little coaching village in nineteenth century England. Jane Bell has been the new innkeeper for a year now, ever since her husband\u2019s death, but she has been in too deep grief to take much care of it. Just as it falls deeper into disrepair, she becomes aware of a large loan that her late husband had taken out without her knowledge. Jane now has a mere three months to repay the debt or she will lose everything. The Innkeeper of Ivy Hill is the story of a village full of charming characters, rather than a tale centered one only one or two characters. In that way, it is like the TV shows Downton Abbey, Poldark, and Little House on the Prairie. Each character has their own story and part to play in Jane\u2019s story, but it is not exclusively about Jane. They are all connected as inhabitants of the town and have some connection to either Jane or the inn that the entire town depends on to some degree. Several different romances and love triangles develop among the characters, friendships are created and mended, and discoveries are made. The book had a quaint, cozy feel to it, though it was interspersed with a little bit of drama and excitement. The characters and the setting had great development and truly portrayed the small town experience. I don\u2019t usually choose to read book like this because they tend to be a little slow and I prefer for the focus to be on only one or two characters. Because this book is like that, I did not enjoy it as well as I had hoped, coming from an author I adore. However, it was very well written and I enjoyed it enough to look forward to the second installment and would gladly recommend it to people who do enjoy that kind of novel.

Three very different women in the town of Ivy Hill have lost much recently. Jane was raised a gentle woman of means, but fell madly for a working man who owned the family's coaching inn. But a year ago she lost her husband and sense of purpose, and now with a huge loan she didn't know about, no business sense because she was not allowed to work at the inn, she may go under.Thora, Jane's mother-in-law, also lost her husband then most recently her son. After Jane inherited the inn, which had been in Thora's family for decades, Thora moved away to live with her sister. With the addition of a new husband, the situation changed and Thora felt it would be prudent to leave her sister and new husband to themselves, and return to the family inn hoping her daughter-in-law would let her live there. She arrived shocked at the run down condition and lack of customers.Rachel had been Jane's childhood friend, was raised with wealth as a gentle woman, is suffering her father's financial loss and now his death, leaving her with nothing. By law the family home must be inherited by a distant male heir.These three women must learn life's lessons the hard way. Jane must come out of her selfimposed exile and face the changes that the inn requires to survive. Thora must see Jane as a valuable member of this staff, as well as owner, and help her. And Rachel must take up a position she never expected, trying to earn her keep.The many people, old friends and new acquaintances that come into their lives are the gem of this book. The characters are all so well done, we know them and we care for them. Gabriel Locke, the lodge's farrier and resident horse expert, turns out to be something way more than they all know. Mercy was Jane's kind understanding friend who went from wealth to starting a boarding school, has a heart of gold. Two men come back into Thora's life and surprise her with such strong suits. Meanwhile, it appeared three men cared for Jane all at once. She seems fairly oblivious to their attraction to her, but that makes it fun. Once she left her lodge and threw herself into the business of bettering the lodge to get it out of debt, you can't help but like her. A generous lady of integrity and humility.Many learned about how capable you can be if you don't give up. Difficult leaps can be made, and the hope on the other side is pretty wonderful."}, {"userName": "Lindsey (Books for Christian Girls)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19266895-lindsey-books-for-christian-girls", "userReview": "About this book:\u201cWelcome to the English village of Ivy Hill, where friendships thrive, romance blossoms, and mysteries await. . . .

Book Two, The Ladies of Ivy Cottage, is scheduled to release December 2017.WHAT I LOVED:- A Charming English Village: This book introduces Ivy Hill, a picturesque English village, and the coaching inn, The Bell, which is of great importance to the village as it provides work and livelihood for many of its inhabitants. With descriptions of each street, building, and business and a helpful detailed picture map at the beginning the reader is really able to visualize and feel the authenticity of this bustling and charming village. I\u2019m so very glad that there will be more books that take place in this little town.- A Wonderful Host of Characters: Since this book is part of series, readers are introduced to an abundance of new characters with interesting personalities and pasts. Readers meet characters that work for the inn, are long-time residents of the area, and some that are newcomers to Ivy Hill. I loved learning about everyone\u2019s past in this story, especially Jane and her friends \u2013 Rachel, Mercy, and Sir Timothy. And I loved all the distinct personalities we meet in this series \u2013 some of my favorites are the flirtatious and charming Charlie Frazer, the kind and compassionate Mercy Grove, and the crotchety Lord Winspear! And I loved the more complex characters like Gabriel Locke and Thora Bell.- Intriguing Secrets and Unanswered Questions: One of things I love and appreciate most about Julie Klassen\u2019s writing is how she never reveals all the information readers need and want. It is fun to be in the dark and dying to know all the answers! This story, more than any other I\u2019ve read by Julie Klassen, has a lot of unanswered questions and secrets that are slowly revealed. I was dying to know: What happened to the loan money? What kind of mischief Patrick was scheming? What happened between Rachel and Sir Timothy? What was John Bell up to before his death? So much going on in this novel, so many questions swirling in my head!- Unique Relationship Focus: I really enjoyed the unique focus on the relationship between Jane and her mother-in-law, Thora. Especially since it was a tense relationship filled with misjudgments and insecurity between two independent and discordant women. Both characters have their flaws and jumped to the wrong conclusions often, but I love how real their relationship felt. I know many women who have similar relationships with their mother-in-laws!WHAT I WASN\u2019T TOO FOND OF:- It\u2019s Hard Being Patient: Oh! This is the hard part of reading a multi-book series! Not all the questions were answered and not every conflict was resolved. I know there is the promise of these things happening in Book 2 of this series, but it will be hard to wait!! And with how one relationship looked like it was on the precipice become something more, it gutted me to see it end on a bit of a cliff! Must. Have. Patience.CONCLUSION:Filled with endearing characters, history, and intriguing developments, The Innkeeper of Ivy Hill is a delightful and heartwarming introduction to the Tales from Ivy Hill series. I cannot wait to visit Ivy Hill again and follow the stories of these charming and likable characters!Austenesque Reviews"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28286656-amy", "userReview": "After much deliberation I have settled on 3.5 stars for Innkeeper of Ivy Hill. I've followed Julie's books for some time, and read them all. After her last book, which took us to a rather risqu\u00e9 new level for her, I'd decided I was done. Then, it appeared she had returned to Bethany House & they had another book listed for her. The first in Julie's series 'Ivy Hill'. Purely due to the publishers sterling reputation, I figured it was worth one more try. To begin with, I could not understand what was the intention of the rather confusing plot. Is this a book about the people of Ivy Hill? Or the Innkeeper, Jane? To be fair to the reader, Jane was not a solid single main character as is the usual case in a story. Rather, this book could have been more appropriately titled 'The Innkeepers of Ivy Hill' (plural), since this is as much about Thora, as it is Jane. The internal conflict between these two was well written, and added much to the depth of both of their relationship with each other and the daily running of The Bell Inn. Why, then such an extension of other characters in the village? Rachel for one has a large chunk of first person narration. The writing is flat and bland for a large chunk of the first 60 % of the story, never seeming to gel correctly, and jumping around people and places. As I came to understand what the author was intending here, I could see the reasons for the overwhelming character intros and first person accounts. However, this would have been more enjoyable by focusing on just Jane (with Thora being a minor character) - and actually making this about the Innkeeper. Next we could have been taken to Thornvale, and Rachel's story could have been told etc. I would have found this more cohesive and more engaging into the series. That's just my feelings overall, and the reasons I held off a 4/5 rating.Great mystery written within in regards to John, his character, Hetty & Johns death. That was well paced and thought out. Having Jane travel to Epsom and get to know Gabriel better was a needed development to the plot. I did wonder while reading that this felt very 'Far from the Madding Crowd', and had influenced Julie some.I've visited Lacock, Salisbury & this area of England. It is very picturesque and steeped in historical charm. It was not hard to imagine any of these locations as described. Good research on location and writing about the era accurately. I will look for the next book, though I was hoping we'd get to focus on one main character at a time from now on. You need to be able to connect as a reader, and this style is just a struggle. By the looks of the summary of future books, it looks like we are going to be following several people at once. Is Julie hoping for a TV series here? As you can see, other reviewers gave up on this book early on. I may have done too except for the fact I make a point of finishing everything I request to review, out of courtesy. To those who did put this down or are tempted to, it does pick up and come clearer the further in you go, but don't be surprised if it takes 3/4 of the book to do so. Thank you to Bethany House & Netgalley for the complimentary digital copy. This is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Sophia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063928-sophia", "userReview": "A bustling small English village of Ivy Hill and it's iconic coaching inn are the setting for this first in the Tales of Ivy Hill series. New colorful characters, complex relationships, and a troublesome situation that brings everyone together. In the spirit of Austen, Gaskell, and Hardy, the author weaves a heartwarming story that gently pulls the reader into the Ivy Hill world and had the reader cheering soundly for Jane and her friends to win against the odds and keep the inn from closing.The story begins with widow, Jane Bell, confronted with troubles that finally pull her out of the fugue she has been in since the death of her husband the year before. Jane was reared as a gentleman's daughter on a nearby estate and she shocked many when she married the local innkeeper's son and then inherited the family inn when he died. The local banker brings shocking news that Jane's husband took out a large loan and never paid it back and now the bank is set to call in the debt and will take the inn. Jane wavers at first with the possibility of just letting the inn go and trying to live on a pittance, but then the yard and horse handler, Gabriel Locke, opens her eyes to how many depend on the inn for their livelihood and that extends to many other businesses in the village. Jane owes it to everyone to try even though John kept her separate from the actual running of the inn and she has little concept of what it will take to turn things around and make a profit.Jane's mother in law, Thora, returns and Jane swallows her pride and partners with the stern and exacting, but hardworking Thora along with John's brother, Patrick, and former manager, Talbot, to turn things around in the three months they have left before they must report back to the bank on the status of the inn.Thora has her own peace to make with her decision to leave, her relationship with Jane, with Talbot, and with her former home, the Bell Inn. She is pursued by two men who see past her hard exterior to the woman inside. Will she take a chance on love with one of them or hold to her decision to avoid losing her independence?As the series title indicates this is more than the story of a person, but a whole village of people. This first book focuses on Jane Bell and her mother in law, Thora Bell, but also introduces several other characters and the set up for the series. There are some complicated relationship histories between Jane and the other Bells and other members of the village and for Thora Bell. I enjoyed how the author wrote these two ladies with strengths and flaws, that they heal as they are faced with challenges, and they both must face a life after losing a husband. Jane had the struggle to straddle the line between her former class as a gentleman's daughter and now being a working class woman as the widow of an innkeeper. She has her private sorrows, personal pride, and struggles now with her own ignorance and assumptions along with other's assumptions about her.Thora grew up an innkeeper's daughter and then was an innkeeper's wife and an innkeeper's mother. The inn is all she knows then she must give pride of place to a woman who has remained aloof and hasn't impressed her with being deserving of her son or the inn. Returning and making amends with Jane is difficult, but then Jane desperately needs her help and Thora realizes she has another chance to be involved in the life of the inn.This is a gently-paced blend of historical, sweet romance, and mystery in the tale. I liked seeing the strong nods to scenes and characters that harked back to more than one classic writer. Those little Easter eggs were fun to encounter along the way.The inspirational elements were suited to the story of growth and renewal- pride overcome, forgiveness and understanding of the past, compassion for others, and generosity to those hurting or in need.The historical aspect was obviously well researched and the details are fascinating throughout the story though there are times when they slow things down somewhat. I personally didn't mind this balance with the character and action side of the plot. I loved the focus on the coaching inn, the coaching industry at the time, women in business, village life and the upper working class of the day.In the background of Jane and Thora's story is also the story of Rachel, Mercy, Patrick and Timothy who all grew up together. The mysterious Gabriel Locke and the newcomer Nicholas Ashford also have their parts to play. The story tied up Thora's story, but left Jane's and these others open and on-going looking forward to more in the series. It doesn't feel like a cliffhanger since the main conflict was resolved just an ongoing story with installments.All in all, this was a grand start to a new series. I love the small village setting and the intro to the characters and series plot. I enjoy stories of the underdog and second chances and family and friends like this. I would recommend it to those who enjoy sweet historical romance, light historical fiction and inspirational fiction.My thanks to Bethany House Publishers for the opportunity to read this story in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27325082-jennifer", "userReview": "I gave this 5 stars because it was a wonderful story.

But after watching Downton Abbey I was addicted! Both in the lives of the wealthy and also those of the common folks as well. Something I think I would fall into if I had been born a long time ago. One thing is certain, the rights of women have definitely come a long way. In those days if a woman was married but her husband died, all of her property, wealth and assets went to the next male in the family. Either a brother, cousin, son or even second or third cousins that may have no knowledge of that family whatsoever. Best-selling author Julie Klassen takes readers into a new series, the Tales of Ivy Hill in her first novel, The Innkeeper of Ivy Hill. It is here that we meet Jane Bell who is still mourning the unexpected death of her husband John and has been left to care for a dilapidated coaching inn, known as the Bell. She has no means to bring it back to its former glory and somehow she finds it odd that her husband would have left the Inn to her over his brother Patrick. When the bank informs Jane that her husband took out a loan of 15,000 pounds and hasn't paid a penny of it back, they give her 90 days to find a way to begin making the necessary repairs to the Inn, come up with a business proposal to show how she might turn a profit in the coming year, or pay off the loan. Jane's mother-in-law, Thora returns to the Inn without realizing the trouble Jane is now facing. She has no way of being able to help Jane and her reputation within the town is less than stellar knowing how difficult and stern she can be. John's brother, Patrick has offered to take over the Inn for Jane so she doesn't have to deal with trying to figure out the logistics of what she will face, but is encouraged by the staff of the Inn and those who work with them, to figure out a way to keep it going. It means the livelihood of town's residents by keeping the Inn operating and to sell it would mean that they would all lose their sources of income as well. All the businesses in town are interconnected in one way helping one another out. When an unexpected guest arrives at the Inn, Jane believes her future might just change, she just isn't sure if it's for the best or worse. I received The Innkeeper of Ivy Hill by Julie Klassen compliments of Bethany House Publishers and Net Galley. The one thing I enjoyed the most about this novel is that Julie Klassen wasn't in a rush to finish the first novel and took her time exploring the complex relationships that Jane and Thora have. From the common people Jane's Inn employs from the coachmen to the maids, and even those she does business with like the butcher and laundress. In a time when it wasn't easy for a woman to make it, I love how well both Thora and Jane dig in to find resources they can utilize when they lack the experience to pull off this endeavor. While I was hoping for more romance between Jane and Gabriel, I am optimistic it may happen in a future novel in this charming and heartwarming series set in England. I definitely learned quite a bit about the coaching inns and how they contributed to the financial well being of the town. I would rate this novel a 5 out of 5 stars and anxiously await the next one!"}, {"userName": "Tammie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3506989-tammie", "userReview": "On a rise overlooking the Wiltshire countryside stands the village of Ivy Hill. Its coaching inn, The Bell, is its lifeblood--along with the coach lines that stop there daily, bringing news, mail, travelers, and much-needed trade.Jane Bell lives on the edge of the inn property. She had been a genteel lady until she married the charming innkeeper who promised she would never have to work in his family's inn. But when he dies, Jane finds herself The Bell's owner, and worse, she has three months to pay a large loan or lose the place. The innkeeper of Ivy Hill is the first series Julie Klassen has written and so far I like it. I was expecting this to have more romance in it since Klassen is known for writing historical Christian romances, but the focus here is more on other types of relationships, with the main focus being on telling Jane's story, while touching on other characters in the town of Ivy Hill as well. There is also very little focus on religion in the book, making this a straight up historical fiction. The author mentioned classics like Cranford as inspiration for the series. The author also said she used the cute historic town of Lacock as the layout for the town of Ivy Hill. That was helpful to me when it came to picturing the town since I've actually been there.Except for a few details that I would have liked to have been included in the book, one being why and how Jane fell in love with John - an innkeeper-to begin with, I think the author has done a good job. I look forward to reading more.Review also posted at Writings of a Reader"}, {"userName": "Kav", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6025638-kav", "userReview": "Opening up this book is like settling in for a binge-viewing of a British mini-series. It put me in mind of Larkrise to Candleford or Cranford. Has the same sense of community and village life -- including all the tension and drama that goes with it. Not to mention the strong women who make a place for themselves in a male dominated society. I made that BBC connection early in my reading so imagine my surprise and delight when the author mentions the same shows as a source of inspiration in her notes at the end of the book! Kind of tickled that I'm on the same wave length as a multi-published author!The story unfolds with an unhurried grace as Klassen transports her readers into another time and place. It celebrates the unique connections found within a community. Every action has a reaction. I couldn't read fast enough to see how things played out -- even though I wanted to slow down and savor every descriptive word.I love the sweeping multi-character approach Klassen uses. She writes from the viewpoints of very different women facing unique challenges. Exquisite detail and subtle nuances sparked my imagination and kept me desperate to for answers. Mind you, I didn't find them all...the author has left some loose ends to continue with in the next installment of the Tales of Ivy Hill series. But there is some closure and the story ends on a high note, for all that there are still questions left unanswered. But I'm fine with that. I'll bask in the glow of a story well told while eagerly anticipating what comes next in 'season 2'.

I often find myself comparing other novels to Klassen\u2019s so it\u2019s only natural that I would compare a Klassen to all the other Klassens that have come before. I must say that while The InnKeeper of Ivy Hill was not as gripping as what I\u2019m used to finding, there was a sense of mystery throughout the story that kept my attention. I\u2019ve come to notice two things about Klassen\u2019s work: She tends to weave in threads of mystery and she KNOWS how to write a love triangle that keeps the reader guessing. And for me, THIS is where the book really shines.I make no secret of my love for an old-fashioned love triangle. But what Klassen did here will certainly become a highlight of my reading year. You have three main heroines here and each of them has multiple options. Not only did Klassen keep me guessing at every turn, but I also couldn\u2019t decide which hero I wanted to see win the lady\u2019s hand.Aside from the mystery and romance, I enjoyed all the historic detail involving an early 1800s English Inn.While the beginning started off in a more subdued fashion, the last third picked up the pace and became the engaging story that I knew Klassen was gifted at. There were twists and turns around every corner. And I cannot wait to see what is in store for these characters next!Rating and Recommendation: I\u2019m giving The Innkeeper of Ivy Hill 5 stars and highly recommend it to Regency fans and Christian Historical Fiction fans.~ I received a copy from Net Galley.

I enjoyed each page and found myself wishing for more time to read about Jane and Thora. While there are hints of romance between several characters, this story is really the story of Jane and her mother-in-law Thora and their efforts to save the family's inn. I almost wonder if Ruth and Naomi are a bit of inspiration, though the romances don't flow from that Biblical account. Jane has allowed life to flow around her for years, and now she is forced with the option of drown or do something. Reluctantly she decides to engage and crawl from her grief. Thora must also decide what she wants her life to look like as she is a widow in her middle years. Both are fighting for the Bell, but must also decide whether to fight for the lives they want to lead. This story drew me back page after page and I am eager for future installments.

Lots of historical details, especially dealing with women's lack of power: their husband's controlled everything and even as a widow she wouldn't necessarily be seen as someone who could manage her affairs (and at the first she certainly couldn't).
