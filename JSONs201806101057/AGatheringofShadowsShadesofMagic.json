Read it in a single day and I cannot wait for the next book.I think I'm a bit of an unintentionally picky reader when it comes to fantasy. A lot of YA fantasy is heavy on the romance and low on the substance, which irks me, but I don't take much pleasure in overlong, dense, wordy adult fantasy series either. I want exciting world-building, strong characters and good pacing that doesn't sacrifice depth. And I feel like Schwab totally gets that.The writing style is detailed and evocative - you can picture this world so easily, even though it is highly sensational, and you can feel the magic running through it. Schwab crafts scenes with both description and tension, firmly cementing her as one of my favourite fantasy authors.It is a world for those who admire imagination. Alternate Londons, some with magic and some without, magic wielders, evil rulers, pirates and - in this installment - a magical tournament called the Essen Tasch. The author uses this tournament to draw the characters together, to create action and excitement, whilst behind it all there looms a dark threat.With rich, evocative storytelling, an original, fantastically-conceived fantasy world, and colourful, weird characters, it's hard to complain. The book buzzes with magical secrets and new discoveries; like an adult version of Narnia, it is a way of walking through the wardrobe and facing all the wonderful and horrifying possibilities.I enjoyed Kell's new experiences, as he comes to term with the lasting effects of what happened in the last book. I enjoyed all the backstabbing, cross-dressing and thievery. But, most of all, I just freaking love Lila. She is the baddest badass of them all and she doesn't give a shit.A Gathering of Shadows goes deeper, drawing us further into this world and developing all the characters. It ends with a promise of more horror and action in the next book. I can't wait.\nAfter all, you can kill people, but you cannot kill magic.Not truly.\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Victoria Schwab", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1695365-victoria-schwab", "userReview": "\u201cI know where you sleep, Bard.\u201dShe smirked. \u201cThen you know I sleep with knives.\u201d*It's hard to believe that A GATHERING OF SHADOWS comes out in less than three months!!!"}, {"userName": "Kat O'Keeffe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4672379-kat-o-keeffe", "userReview": "love the writing, love the world, LOVE THESE CHARACTERS. the ending hurt my soul but fortunately i have book 3 to jump into immediately."}, {"userName": "Petrik", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik", "userReview": "It\u2019s unbelievable how I started this book with the lowest possible expectation and it still managed to disappoint me. I know this is a beloved book in the YA community, you might wanna stay away from reading this review if you\u2019re easily offended. Seriously stay away.I think it\u2019s better for me to start off with the parts I like about the book first, there\u2019s only a few anyway. First, Holland, every single appearance from him made the plot and the book so much better, despite his appearance being rarer than the amount of Hinduism in my city. Second, the last 50 pages of the book were actually quite good, with some flaws but at least it\u2019s captivating. Finally, VE Schwab's prose remained great to read as always. Holland is literally the only character that pushed me into finishing this trilogy cause I need to know more about him and his fate.Now, for all the shit, A Gathering of Shadows, where do I even begin with the problem in this one? Let\u2019s start with an easy one first. This book is majorly afflicted with the infamous 2nd book syndrome, the first 350 pages are painful to read, pretty much a pointless filler. A cow\u2019s opinion is better than these 350 pages and for god sake a cow\u2019s dialogue is literally only \u201cmoo\u201d \u201cmoo\u201d \u201cmoo\u201d, see how pointless that sounds? Well, that\u2019s how the first 350 pages are. It\u2019s about preparing for a magical arena tournament, which ended up being a huge copycat of Avatar: The Legend of Korra.The battles in the arena itself are okay at best which made reading the 350 pages of nothing completely a worthless experience. Don't get me wrong, I love slow paced books, most adult fantasy books I read are slow paced and trust me, the books I love used these pages carefully. Building character developments, slowly building relationship, explain more on the world-building aspect etc. Not spending time brooding, doing insta-love, random making out and obsessing over Delilah fucking Bard, which I\u2019ll get into in a moment.I\u2019m also very disappointed with how much time the characters spent on Red London, seriously there are 4 London, make use of them please. What\u2019s the point of creating 4 London if the story is going to take place almost all the time in Red London?? What are you doing? Trying to make us see the color of apple in London? Every time the story shifted to White London (scarcely) it\u2019s actually so much better. However, the most significant problem I had with the book lies in one and one factor only. The damn characters, especially Lila fucking Bard or Lila fucking bad or Lila fucking Bald, whatever her special damned kind is.Kell and Rhy spent all their time here fighting and whining over being saved? \u201cWAHHH WAHHHHH YOU SAVED MEEEEE LET ME DIEEEEE BUT I WANNA LIVE AND I\u2019M SAD WAHHH WAHHH YOU PISSED ME OFF\u201dDude\u2026.. kill yourself\u2026 bite your tongue, chop your head off, climb the Big Ben like you belong in the Assassin Creed and jump yourself to death, I don\u2019t care just\u2026 stop whining over being saved. Seriously I can\u2019t stress this enough, other than Holland I seriously just want all these characters to die. BUT none of them can compare to the ultimate Mary Sue, Delilah fucking bard, the Wonder Woman, the alien, the predator, whatever she is cause she doesn\u2019t know too.I was led to believe the main character of this series is Kell, I was wrong. It was Lila, the narrative treated the reader as if we\u2019re brain damaged or have short term memory. It will remind us countless times during everyone\u2019s POV that Lila is unlike most girls. I liked her in the first book and I can\u2019t believe how much I hated her in this installment. She\u2019s an ultimate Mary Sue, apparently 4 months is enough to become a fluent speaker in a new language, and become a magician, from a thief. In the first book she was just a thief. In this one she\u2019s a female Voldemort but wait\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t call her a female because she\u2019s one of a damned kind.Here's most dialogues around Lila in the book, featuring meMe: Hi Lila\n\n\u201cI am one of a damned kind\u201d\n\nMe: urmm okay? So how are yo--\n\n\u201cI am not most girls.\u201d\n\nMe: \u2026.\n\n\u201cI am not most girls.\u201d\n\n Me: Okay I get it you\u2019re not most girl, you just said\u2014\n\n\u201cI am one of a damned kind\u201d\n\nMe: Okay you fucking E.T I get--\n\n\u201cI am not most girls.\u201d \n\nMe: Hey-\n\n\u201cI am not most girls.\u201d\n\nKell walking towards me with his endless angst and frown but then, seems like a random thought appeared in his head and he said:\n\n\u201cLila is unlike most girls.\u201d\n\nMe: STTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- \n\n\u201cI am not most girls.\u201d\n\nMe: HHHHHHHHHPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!\n\n\u201cI am one of a damned kind\u201d\n\nDrew Barrymore from the movie \u201850 First Dates\u2019 would\u2019ve remember Delilah fucking Bard for the endless repetition in the narrative to always remind the reader that she\u2019s one of a kind, badass, can do shit, put Lila in a Star Wars and she\u2019ll be the ultimate Jedi oh my lord.\n\n\u201cShe bent most of the rules. She broke the rest.\u201d\n\nYeah, including my brain for reading your stupidity.Here\u2019s one of the few trying so hard to be badass but idiotic dialogue.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s immortal until they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nNo shit. What\u2019s next? Everyone\u2019s dead when they\u2019re killed? Everyone\u2019s alive when they have a heartbeat? You can clap if you have hands?This is a book that should\u2019ve been condensed by at least 300 pages and it would\u2019ve been so much better. There\u2019s way too many useless information that wouldn\u2019t affect anything in the main story. Plus the ending left us in a cliffhanger just when the story FINALLY about to get interesting and now I have to continue because my momma didn\u2019t raise a quitter and I\u2019m not about to quit now. I\u2019ve prepared some alcohol for my next read, I hope it could be better but my expectation for the last book is minus zero.If you enjoy the book, I'm truly happy for you. I wish I could but I can't.. not for this one. Also, if you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m reading this series, it\u2019s because VE Schwab tricked me completely into thinking that this will be an adult oriented book like her \u2018Vicious\u2019 (which I love) and IT\u2019S NOT! If I knew what I\u2019m getting into, I wouldn't had spend any money I worked hard for into this trilogy.You can find the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "I'd like to propose a contender for the worst feeling in the world: going into a book with 100% certainty you\u2019ll like it, and then that confidence slowlyyyyy - almost imperceptibly - fading into hatred. Especially when the average rating of said book is a four-point-f*cking-three-five.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...But I can\u2019t not hate this book. So much of this is nightmare scenario after nightmare scenario wrapped into one misleading synopsis. I was, quite frankly, SHOCKED by how quickly universally adored author V.E. Schwab introduced the not-like-other-girls trope, which you all know I abhor. At least buy a girl dinner first, Victoria. I'll set the scene: Liiiiilaaaaa (read that in a sarcastically loving voice, please) is at a market. Literally looking at knives because she has no personality traits or sense of fun. Anyway, another stereotype on two legs the captain of her ship says, for no goddamn reason except, I presume, his own terribleness: \u201cMost girls covet dresses.\u201d Bad enough, right? Already enough to make me cringe hard and dock at least a star or so? IT GETS WORSE. Darling Lila\u2019s response: \u201cI am not most girls.\u201d It literally cannot get any more blatant. I was so disgusted I read the scene aloud to my sister, and she shuddered.In fact, it\u2019s kind of...strange how sexist this book is. The great thing about YA books is that a lot of them are written by feminists, but the subliminal messages here made my skin crawl. There\u2019s not just the not-like-other-girls stuff (or, as I call it, Sexism Lite: So Quirky Ladies Who Hate Other Women Can Still Claim to be Feminist). Every. Single. Female character is judged for her appearance. Strong women are stripped of their gender identity - a couple of times, characters question whether muscular women are truly women at all. Which, like, f*ck you forever. Are you kidding me? And don\u2019t forget the princess (from Vesk?). Her only character trait is boy-crazy. Instead of being a powerful female leader, she follows Kell around like a lovesick puppy...exactly, we are told, what she did to Rhy a couple years before. And don't forget the disapproving tone of the text when she's with any man. Subliminal slut shaming - cool! Oooh, and \u201cShe looked like the kind of girl who would point to something \u2014 or someone \u2014 and say, \u2018I want one of those.\u2019\u201d Wow! Please tell me more about how there are kinds of girls.More fun stuff: I literally hate all of these characters. How often does that happen?! Like, don\u2019t get me wrong, I am completely just a heartless vessel designed to carry as much bitterness and anger as possible, but usually I\u2019m at least neutral toward somebody. Not here. We follow four-ish main characters: Alucard, Rhy, Kell and Lila. (Putting Lila last because, if you couldn\u2019t already tell by the fury leaking through this, she is the crown jewel in my treasure trove of loathing.)The fun thing about this book is we get two - yes, two! - characters fighting for dominance over the same piece of sh*t stereotype! Yeah, Schwab had so much success with one character in that dumbass role that she went two for two in this one. I\u2019m talking about Rhy and Alucard, and I\u2019m talking about the YA male character archetype that I CANNOT ESCAPE. The roguish, flirty, handsome societal elite, who\u2019s just soooooo tired of his hard-knock life of wealth and luxury and because of it can\u2019t even stand to live up to expectations or within social bounds. Also, we\u2019re always supposed to find these types funny, and I have never cracked a smile at one of these dumbos.I feel like I can\u2019t goddamn escape these goons of late. They\u2019re the Will Herondales, the what\u2019s-his-name from Heartless (the jester guy who wore eyeliner), Adrian from Bloodlines (will I ever finish that series?), one or more of the 8000 guys from Throne of Glass (literally can\u2019t remember). Sorry I spaced on some of the names, but there\u2019s an epidemic of these bozos and they\u2019re SO unmemorable. But to have TWO of the same stereotype?! In the same book?! Extraordinary. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it (and pray I never will again).Now...Kell. There is no way on God\u2019s great green Earth I can fill a paragraph talking about Kell. He is the most boring character to ever boring up his way through a trilogy. Does the boy have any traits? Does he have a sense of humor? Fun, maybe? No? He\u2019s just going to grumble around for 500 pages and be in love with Lila for no reason? Okay.And...here we go. The moment I\u2019ve been waiting for since approximately page 17 of this book. Talking about why LILA SUCKS UP A STORM. The gal\u2019s a prime example of a really annoying factor of bad character-writing: telling and not showing. How many times are we TOLD, \u201cLila is smart. Lila is a quick study. Lila was born with the magical talent of the Chosen One, but maybe if we don\u2019t use that term then you won\u2019t notice and write about it in your reviews. Lila is brave. Lila is strong. Lila looks for trouble.\u201d Now, compare that to how often it\u2019s actually proven. Rarely, if ever. It\u2019s annoying and boring and makes me want to sign V.E. Schwab up for an intro to creative writing class.But that\u2019s not where my problems end with ol\u2019 Lila. No, it takes a bit more than that to end up on my most-hated characters list. Lila\u2019s an annoying, bossy brat with a death wish, an inferiority complex, and the impenetrable belief that she knows better than everyone else. She knows better than her captain: when she is so insubordinate that Alucard has to remind her \u201cI am your captain! You are my crew,\u201d she thinks, \u201cThe barb struck with unexpected force.\u201d NOT A BARB, LILA. YOU ARE NOT IN CHARGE. YOU ARE A PETTY THIEF ABOARD A SHIP. GET OVER YOURSELF!She does the same to the head-magicky-guy (I kind of never paid attention to the terms in this book). At one point in the last book, I guess, he told her he thought she had magic within her. Lila latches onto that and uses it as her justification for making a metric sh*t ton of bad decisions that could have extraordinarily negative impacts on her, her loved ones, and the entire goddamn world(s). When Chief Inspector Magic tries to prevent her from making one of these many dumb choices, she responds, \"You told me that I had magic in me. Now you don't think I have what it takes?\" Um, you\u2019re untrained and a full-on dumbass and you want this guy who actually knows his stuff to fan your already-enormous ego and tell you you can win a huge magic tournament?And she does it again, to Kell, who knows more about her and more about the kind of magic she wants to do than ANYONE. And she\u2019s just a total bitch to him and he\u2019s all, \u201cyeah ok\u201d and kisses her stupid face. Ugh. I\u2019m getting so angry AND putting off math homework that\u2019s due in 37 minutes. It\u2019s time to stop talking about Lila and try to wrap this shindig up.So much of this book is just...cliche to me. That moment when Lila is talking to the man at the mirror stall and he calls her Lila and she goes, all quasi-spook-ily, It wasn't until after I left that I realized I had never told him my name.................... or whatever? Made me GAG. And it wasn't even for anything! That guy never comes back. We never get more info, really, on the mirrors or on the shopkeeper or any of that. It's just a dumb cliche being used for a dumb cliched manner of foreshadowing. Like, omg, does she want the dark power slash thing she is entirely uneducated about?! Even though she shouldn't?? Even though the big strong experienced man warns her not to do whatever said thing is? Oh my god! I have never read anything like that before! Except, like, you know...The Winner's Kiss, Divergent, Siege and Storm, Throne of Glass, The 5th Wave, Passenger, Rebel Belle, Alice. I could definitely go on. Because that is one of my least favorite tropes that also manages to be super boring in every instance it is used. Seriously, shall I ever cease to be astounded by the untouched realms of young adult fantasy this book doth discover?And after all that, it\u2019s not even fun. I wanted to read about a magic tournament, but it took 350 pages to get there and only lasted about 100 (generously). The rest of the book is a carbon copy of the events of the last book. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but the grand cliffhanger of the book happens in the exact same way at the exact same event as the last book. It is, in other words, a snoozefest.Bottom line: clich\u00e9d, sexist, teeming with some of the worst characters I\u2019ve ever read, misleading, repetitive, occasionally illogical, and boring. Does that sum it up?

You feel safe when you finally get the next chapter. The tension that plagued you while reading the prior installment, coming ever closer as you neared the end, like footsteps speeding up behind you, making you curse your stupidity for taking a walk alone at night in an unfamiliar city . . . That tension isn't there.You've developed a trust, a camaraderie . . . an understanding with the author.You have been duly warned.When we last left Lila and Kell, they were parting ways. We were sad, but we expected no less. After all:\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNot till I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\u201cSeen what?\u201dHer smile widened. \u201cEverything.\u201d\nKell can't go with her. He has responsibilities . . . PLUS, you know, there's that thing that happened, that thing that tied him even closer to the royal family . . . The royal family he's meant to be part of . . . The royal family that instead treats him like a commodity . . . Lemme tell you, people--it gets WORSE.Lila, on the other hand, is having the adventure she's always dreamed of. On a PIRATE ship. *coughs* I mean, privateer ship. She got her position by killing another crew member. *shakes head at Lila* Buuuuut it turned out they didn't like the fellow much anyway, so it all worked out. A little too well, actually. Lila develops a sort-of friendship with the captain. She earns the respect of the crew. Worse, she begins to feel like she herself is a true part of the crew.Can't have that. So when Captain announces his intent to return to Red London and participate in a prestigious wizards' tournament, Lila decides that she won't be going with them when next they leave.And she doesn't. But not for the reasons she anticipated. You: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!Me:\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. Things happen in A DARKER SHADE OF MAGIC, and those things have CONSEQUENCES. CONSEQUENCES that you will not believe until you see them for yourself. What does it mean that Kell's life is now tied to another's? What will happen now that a living being from Grey London has permanently crossed over into Red London? And what would you say if I told you that you only think you've seen chaos in White London?Last year, A DARKER SHADE OF MAGIC made my Best Books of 2015 list. This year, A GATHERING OF SHADOWS is already a strong contender for the #1 spot. If you have yet to check out Schwab for yourself, what are you waiting for? The woman is GENIUS. This world and the characters that populate it are one of the most unique I've encountered in ages. I love it. Even as I'm screaming at Lila to THINK before she acts. For once. Even as my heart is breaking for Kell, b/c he can longer ignore the charade of his circumstances. Even as all the Londons hover on the edge of DOOM . . . I love it.

Truth is, when I started A Gathering of Shadows, one of my best friend asked me if I thought she would like, and strangely, I wasn't able to answer straight away. Color me surprised. How comes this series holds such a strong grip on me and still I am hesitating when recommending it? I understood, then. These books? They sneak up on you. There's honestly not that much action in the first halves of BOTH of them and yet you're never bored. You're enchanted, mesmerized like a child reading HP for the first time (YES, I'M GOING THERE), your eyes widening at the sight of this wondrous, original world served by its fascinating and real characters for whom you can't help but care deeply, including : \u2714 a kickass thief who's giving strong female-lead a new name (that's Lila, by the way) : Remember my complaints about Feyre in A Court of Thorns and Roses? I expressed how tired I was of the beloved (GAG) pattern implying that the only reason women fought was for their families, as if women couldn't, for the life of them, be badass for the thrill of it. Lila made a liar of me. Thank you, Lila.\n\"Delilah Bard had a way of finding trouble. She'd always thought it was better than letting trouble find her, but floating in the ocean in a two-person skiff with no oars, no view of land, and no real resources save the ropes binding her wrists, she was beginning to reconsider.\"\n\u2714 a loyal magician whose doubts and outbursts make you want to both smack and hug him (but mostly, hugs). Eaten by guilt, confused by his sudden thrives for darkness (am I bad to love that part?), in need to adapt to his bond with his brother, so freaking alone and caged, Kell stays one of my favorite characters because he's flawed and brave and endearing and oh, yes, often wrong. (MY FROWNING BOY!) (in redheads I trust) (\u2190how could I NOT love him now tell me?)\n\"You could at least pretend to be grateful.\"\"And you couldn't have picked something a little more...I don't know...imposing?\"\"...A bloody handprint?\" retorted Rhy. \"Oh, what about a glowing black eye?\"Kell glowered.\"You're right,\" continued Rhy, \"I should have just drawn a frowning face. But then everyone would know it's you.\"\n\u2714 a deceptive Captain who may or may not be a pirate (how's this for awesome?). Okay, okay, I have to admit that he made me narrow my eyes several times at first. What? I come from a loyal bunch (frowning boy, remember?). But in the end, his character added so much wit and fun to the story that he won me. Also, that development? YES YES YES. \n\"Alucard had shaken his head, exasperated. \"The accent of a royal and the sensibilities of a thief.\" But Lila had only smiled. She'd said something very similar once, to Kell. Before she knew he was a royal. And a thief, for that matter.\"\n\u2714 a lost prince who's endlessly trying to keep darkness at bay : Oh Rhy, Rhy, Rhy. I cannot say that I always agreed with his choices, but the complicity between him and Kell - the loyalty - prevents me for holding any grudge (if I was into grudges, that is)\n\"There was a new restlessness to his motions, a taut energy that mirrored Kell's. And yet, Rhy's was different. Manic. Dangerous. His moods were darker and their turn sharper, cutting the span of a second.\"\n\u2714 ... Oh, and those assholes (you know who I mean) (there're plenty to choose really) As for the plot, although I was more than excited to come back into this world, and that Kell and Lila own a special place in my heart, I have to admit that I spent the beginning feeling restless because I longed for them to be together - not necessarily romantically (WHO AM I KIDDING) (THE CHEMISTRY!! GAH!), but really, their interactions? They're the best, and they both balance each other's perfectly. Separated, they lose a little bit of their charm in my opinion. But. Now that I finished the book, I understand why Victoria Schwab made this choice and the last 40%? Brilliant, exhilarating, and as far as I'm concerned, PERFECTION. There's something to say about a fantasy plot that stays unpredictable, because trust me, when you read a lot of fantasy, it becomes rarer and rarer. \nThis\n is why I'm rounding up my rating. \u25b6 Give me thrill, give me peril, give me gasps, and I'm the happiest reader of the world.My heart, though. \nFor more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[ and i really hope she's not antari, missing eye or no, because i want her identity, her abilities, to be singular; something hers and hers alone, not part of a tradition or tribe. she's a monolith, not a link in some chain.

I cannot believe that I waited nearly a year between the first book and this one, but here we are, and now I\u2019m convinced that Victoria sacrificed an unhealthy number of virgins for her writing skills, because this series is absolute magnificence. I loved A Darker Shade of Magic so much that I was nervous to see if the second book would hold up, but let me tell you, it absolutely did, and now I am both horrified and desperately in need of seeing how it all ends up.\n \u201cI am Delilah Bard,\u201d she thought, as the ropes cut into her skin. \u201cI am a thief and a pirate and a traveler. I have set foot in three different worlds, and lived. I have shed the blood of royals and held magic in my hands.\u201d\nI only thought that I loved the characters of this series in the first book, but that was nothing compared to the feelings that I have for them by this point. There\u2019s Lila, who took me a little bit of time to be won over by in ADSOM, but who has me utterly captivated in this installment. Her brash, headstrong, clever nature is only magnified even further as she comes into her own in the world of Red London, and while she still feels this evident need to prove herself and to come out on top, her entire attitude has been tempered\u2014if only slightly\u2014by the pains that her previous actions have caused. She\u2019s also still determined to avoid dealing with her feelings towards a certain redheaded Antari, which lends beautifully to the incredible slow burn of the brief romantic undertones to these books.\n \u201cI do not know why you two are circling each other like stars. It is not my cosmic dance. But I do know that you come asking after one another, when only a few strides and a handful of stars divide you.\u201d\nPrecious Kell, on the other hand, is still my favorite; I\u2019m constantly torn between being amazed by his skills and abilities, and wanting to jump in and protect him from the cruelty he faces, not only as one of the last remaining Antari, but as the neglected adopted son of the King and Queen. My years of reading fantasy novels have taught me that it\u2019s difficult for me to relate to \u201clawful good\u201d characters who rely so heavily on their virtues and honor, as Kell does, but Victoria writes him so flawlessly that it never grows stale or predictable. On top of everything else, his relationship with his brother, Rhy, is one of the most wholesome, pure, and precious things I have ever seen in my entire life.\nRhy held Kell\u2019s pain in his hands, while Kell held Rhy\u2019s life in his.\nRhy Maresh is, I think, one of the most lovable fictional characters who has ever been written. I don\u2019t know if I have ever met a fan of this series who does not adore him at least a little bit, especially upon getting to know the quiet self-loathing that resides under his charisma and charm. He broke my heart so many times during his struggles with the lengths Kell has gone to in order to save him, and the fact that he values his own presence in the world so little is crushing, yet nevertheless, Rhy is a constant source of drama, amusement, and sweet brotherly love in a world full of violence and fear. The fact that both of these princes would so readily give up everything for one another is perhaps my single favorite aspect to this gorgeous series thus far.\n \u201cFix your crown, my prince,\u201d he called back as he reached the door. \u201cIt\u2019s crooked.\u201d\nOf course, this review would be wholly incomplete without taking a moment to talk about the utterly fantastic addition to the cast: Alucard Emery, privateer, playboy, magical aficionado, and captain of the Night Spire crew. He is hilarious, delightful in every way, and an absolute deviant who never fails to keep you guessing. I love his entire presence in the story, and though I am left with a million and one questions about his past and how it relates to the lives of the Maresh family, it is easily one of the things that I am most excited about tying up in A Conjuring of Light.\n \u201cMagic is tangled, so you must be smooth.Magic is wild, so you must be tame.Magic is chaos, so you must be calm.Are you calm, Kell?\u201d\nBesides the wonderful cast of characters (including one special individual who I\u2019m not going to mention here for fear of spoiling anyone, but let me say that I am absolutely ecstatic to see things through his perspective on occasion, and terrified to see what he will do next), there\u2019s also the fact that, once again, Victoria proves her writing prowess through incredible action scenes and magical world-building. There is a tournament featured in this installment that never grows stale or dull; despite its potential for repetition, as is frequent with \u201ctrials\u201d in books, not once did I lose the feeling of gripping the edge of my seat.\n \u201cI gave him my life, but you cannot ask me to stop living.\u201d\nThis sequel also delves much further into the history of Red London and its surrounding lands, as well as the political climate between the kingdom of Arnes and its allies and potential enemies. It was such a fantastic buildup of information, but I can\u2019t help but wonder how it can all possibly be addressed in the finale. That said, I have no doubts that I will be pleased with how everything turns out (and it doesn\u2019t hurt that I know there are further books coming along in the future, too!).\nThey crashed into each other as if propelled by gravity, and he didn\u2019t know which one of them was the object and which the earth, only that they were colliding.\nI don\u2019t think I can say too much more without spoiling any of the twists and turns in this installment, so I\u2019ll end this review on this note: if you enjoy fantasy worlds with lovable characters, a brilliant (yet never overdone) magic system, world-building and history for days, and enough twists and turns to never let you find a moment\u2019s rest, I cannot recommend this series highly enough\u2014and I cannot wait to read the final piece to the story!---Buddy read with Terry and Julie! \u2665\u2665\u2665You can find this review and more on my blog, or you can follow me on twitter, bookstagram, or facebook!"}, {"userName": "C.G.

It's not that I didn't miss or crave our favorite duo's crazy adventures together again, just as much as they probably must have themselves. (In fact, V Schwab better have a whole lotta that in store for us next!) But as they say, distance makes the heart grow fonder and the same is true for my fickle reader's heart.

If you have not picked up this series yet, pick it up now. Right now. I feel I can't even put into words how I feel about this book - but I'm going to try anyway.To start, I liked \"A Darker Shade of Magic\" (book #1 in this series) a lot - but I wasn't out of my mind in love. I liked the characters and the world building was so unique and engaging. The story was good- but it left me wanting more to happen to the characters (which was perfect, because I knew there was a sequel coming out.) And I'm not gonna lie... I wanted a spark between Kell and Lila. Sorry not sorry.This book took the story to a new level. I mean- I was totally mind blown. There are so many good points to hit on. Action. Magic. Pirates. Balls. Masks. Competitions. Serious chemistry. Yes you read that right. Chemistry.AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FEELS. DONT EVEN.Just to break it down a little bit though...Lila = Extreme badass extraordinaire. Heavens I love this girl.Kell = Pretty much a saint. I can't explain it.. he's just wonderful, and tormented, and wonderful...Alucard = I can't pinpoint him, and I LOVE that. Rhy  = King of banter... and of aggravating the living shit out of Kell in the most wonderful waysThe villian who shall remain unnamed for now = BETCHA DIDNT SEE THAT COMING.The characters are so beautifully woven together. The plot is absolutely fantastically and horribly unpredictable. Oh and the writing - oh it was superb. Beautiful in every way. \n\u201cPolitics is a dance until the moment it becomes a war. And we control the music.\u201d \nNow I want to prepare you, my fellow readers. Lila and Kell are apart for a very good chunk of this book. BUT I PROMISE it is well worth the agony of seeing them apart. SO so so so so worth it. Just you wait. Plus, there are so many great moments in their separate paths before they reunite. \n\u201cI know it\u2019s mad, but for a second I thought it was \u2026\u201d \"Saints, you\u2019re seeing her in everyone and everything now, Kell? There\u2019s a word for that.\u201d \"Hallucination?\u201d \"Infatuation.\u201d \nI refuse to discuss the ending right now. I refuse. But I promise you this- there are some very fulfilling moments before the ending. Superb. New favorite series.

I have shed the blood of royals and held magic in my hands. And a ship full of men cannot do what I can, I don't need any of you.

I feel it's just another set up for more things to come in the next book. At some point though, magic welders come together in The Element Games called Essen Tasch. Some people I didn't expect were in these games and against each other. It was pretty damn cool! I loved reading about Kell and Rhy together again. They are so funny and caring. They are so close in everything they do and it was so wonderful to see them fighting for each other. To read the things that only love for someone you consider your brother can bring to your heart. Rhy wants Kell to compete in the games but Kell doesn't want to for certain reasons. \"Kell. My greatest fear in life isn't dying. It's being the source of someone else's suffering. I know you feel trapped. I know I'm your cage. And I can't---\" His voice broke, and Kell could feel his brother's pain, everything he tried to smother until dark and drown until morning. \"You will do this, \" said Rhy. \"For me. For both of us.\" Kell held his brother's gaze. \"All right,\"he said.And Lila and Kell get to see each other again. And Rhy too, the whole gang. It was so great!

The dust has settled in Red London, but the memories and repercussions are still haunting our princes. And in this world there are four parallel Londons that coexist in this universe: \u27bd Grey London - (smells like smoke) is like our real world's London, with no magic. Delilah Bard is from this London.\u27bd Red London - (smells like flowers) is the home of the main protagonist, Kell, where he and his royal family rule. There is an abundance of magic in this London, most coming from a red river which lights up the whole city.\u27bd White London - (smells like blood) is a city in war with itself. It was ruled by evil twins, but now has a new king. Everyone in this London tries to fight for magic and power within this corrupt city.\u27bd Black London - (we don't know what it smells like) and is still basically a mystery. It is essentially a lost city, since regular people cannot travel between worlds.\n\n\u201cYou can kill people, but you cannot kill magic.\u201d\n\nI completely gushed about this in my A Darker Shade of Magic review, but this plot and concept is truly unique and unlike anything I've ever read before. I did enjoy this more than A Darker Shade of Magic, but I still wasn't as in love as most people are with this series. I am completely head over heels captivated with this cast, but the Tri-Wizard Tournament reminiscent storyline left a lot to be desired. This is a very character driven story and, bless V.E. Schwab, the characters in this are nothing short of amazing: \u27bd Kell - Our most powerful magician.\u27bd Rhy - Our king in waiting. \u27bd Delilah Bard - Our finally found pirate! \u27bd Alucard - Our brand new captain. Like, two amazing ships are full sails ahead, but I always feel so underwhelmed by the romantic scenes. Like, I know not every book has to have romance and/or sex, but throw a girl a freakin' bone. I would do sick and terrible things for a mutually romantic understanding with either of these OTPS, because the missed-connections are killing me. \n\n\u201cYou two are circling each other like stars. It is not my cosmic dance. But I do know that you come asking after one another, when only a few strides and a handful of stairs divide you.\u201d\n\nAnd let me say, I, Melanie Parker, was personally living for any interaction with Alucard and Rhy. Like, I was such a hot mess when the scene in Rhy's room happened. If you've read this book then you know the scene. Like, I was gasping, screeching, rolling around in my bed. It wasn't pretty. All I want in A Conjuring of Light is a play by play of their daily interactions with each other. It truly is all I need in this life.Delilah Bard is one of the best characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. Seriously, she is exactly the type of girl I would want my future daughter to read about. Seeing her overcome her past is one of the greatest things in this book. The fact that she always puts herself, her adventures, her needs, and wants first is so admirable and so important to see. Yet, seeing her struggle with being able to love and being able to be vulnerable is something I haven't got words for. Delilah Bard is so important to me. She is truly a 10 out of 10 character. \n\n\u201cPeople could only hurt you if you cared enough to let them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the opening scene in this book? Holy shit. One of the best I've ever read. I actually was unsure of what I was going to start in April, so I took like five books off my bookshelves and figured I'd read the first chapter of each and see what interested me the most. I started with this book, and I never picked up another, because this opening chapter was so freakin' outstanding! Thank you, Delilah Bard!And now I feel bad because I didn't write anything about our main protagonist, Kell, but he's a little cinnamon roll, too! I live for his brooding moments, and the amazing banter between him and Rhy! And the angst between him and Alucard was everything I could have ever asked for in a protective big brother! Seriously, I loved that backstory! I also love seeing Kell actually just enjoying life, even though those moments are few and far between. As much as I love this quartet of characters, I'll be honest, nothing really happened in most of this book. The pacing didn't feel slow, because, like I've said 100 times, the characters grow and develop a lot, but the events in between leave a lot to be desired. The start and the end of this book were action packed, tense, and completely amazing, but the middle of the story was very uneventful, even with a big tournament happening. I for sure wouldn't recommend this for people who don't like very character driven stories. But if you do like character driven stories, this book is home to four amazing ones! I do plan on reading A Conjuring of Light very soon, because I have to know how this series wraps up! Hopefully it wraps up into two relationships, because my heart can't deal with any other outcome.

But, with all this epicness so early in the year, there are also some fears arising, as well\u2026and that\u2019s if I can keep up all this win-It\u2019s a long year, and there\u2019s still a lot of disappointment to be had (Like a couple ends to a few of my favorite series that fell flat, unfortunately). But one thing is an absolute certainty: In a sea of losers, when it comes to second books in series and such, I never had any doubt about how amazing the Darker Shade second book would be\u2026.and I have no doubt that the end will take my breath away. \nBut he\u2019d missed her, and with the city so overrun, how was he supposed to find her again?Just follow the knives, said a voice in his head. And the bodies they\u2019re lodged in.\nI have this curse, you see, where I HATE second books-almost always. I will admit that that\u2019s began to change as of late, but I still find that a few eek in here and there. More often than not, though, it seems the third and final books have been the largest problem: Lack of execution, not tying things up, changing the whole premise of the story, changing characters, etc. etc.-And it has been a large disappointment, more often than not. It\u2019s starting to make the second book curse look tame!! But no, when I picked this book up, I immediately felt my weary muscles relax, my mood lighten, and my heart begin to beat faster and faster. \n Dangerous.Reckless.Foolish.Mad.\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that this fell into one of my least favorite second book tropes (was it a trope, though?? It was kind of a choice?), because every sentence, every page, every little thing was written so beautifully and made it so you couldn\u2019t help to read one more page, one more chapter\u2026and then, before you knew it, you were ten more percent in and still couldn\u2019t stop. \nLila stopped drawing her finger through the cider, and no one noticed that the spilled liquid kept moving, tracing patterns across the wood. Someone set a fresh drink in front of her.Alucard was calling for attention.\u201cTo London,\u201d he said, raising his glass.Lila raised her own.\u201cTo London,\u201d she said, smiling like a knife. \nThese characters just have a way about them. It\u2019s not so much that they are different from other characters we love, adore, cherish, admire, obsess about-No, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s something in their chemistry, in their DNA, something that, immediately upon meeting them, crawled under your skin without you even realizing it. It's something that made you think about them long after you had closed the book. It's something that had you thinking about them in the dark, longing for more of their adventure deep into the night. You just have this deeper understanding of them\u2026.and yet you still want to know more.\nHe didn\u2019t have anything on his person, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to find anything in his coat, not unless he wanted it to be found. He sometimes worried that the coat had a mind of its own. The only other person who\u2019d ever managed to find what they wanted in its pockets was Lila. He\u2019d never found out how she\u2019d done that. Traitorous coat. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to explain how much I adore this story, for I can\u2019t think of many books where something I hate becomes a giggle fest for me. A sleight of hand. A shadow in the corner. A lingering thought. A hopeless wish, or maybe even a longing so deep they saw each other everywhere-it\u2019s the simplest thing, yet it gets under your skin and becomes a part of you. I adore these characters so intensely that it became a visceral thing when one of them would hurt, when one of them would cry, when one of them was in absolute pain. And I know you all probably think it\u2019s all Kell and all Lila\u2026but it\u2019s not-Not even close.\nAs a thief in the night, Lila Bard knew that staying out of the light was the surest way to stay alive, but she couldn\u2019t help it, she relished this kind of trick. Standing right in front of a mark while you pocketed their coins. Smiling while you stole. Looking them in the eye and daring them to see past the ruse. Because the best tricks were the ones pulled off not while the mark\u2019s back was turned, but while they were watching. \nThere\u2019s Rhy. There\u2019s Alucard. There\u2019s Calla. And, ya know, there\u2019s Lila\u2019s crew\u2026but that\u2019s beside the point-YOU GET THE PICTURE. Rhy and Alucard became two characters who I couldn\u2019t live without, simply because they meant the world to my lovely Kell and my fierce Lila-they were central to the story and not only added to it, but enhanced every single scene. They brought forth extreme visceral, intense emotion that caused the most amazing feelings-Pain, heartache. Soul-crushing love. Unyielding friendship. Loyalty\u2026.Jealousy. Like I said, there really is no emotion I haven\u2019t felt while reading this series, and I can\u2019t help but to want to re-read it already. In fact, I could read these two books over and over and over again. But I\u2019m at work (SHHHHH, my laptop has gone to SHIT) and I can\u2019t keep going on and on and on and\u2026..yeah, I love this story, this could go on for a while. So! I will get onto what I want to anyway: My two beautiful lovebirds, Kell and Lila. \n\nI am Delilah Bard, she thought. Pirate, thief, magician.Her fingertips began to thrum.I have crossed worlds and taken ships. Fought queens and saved cities.Her bones shuddered and her blood raced.I am one of a kind.\n\nLila is a stubborn little shit, I\u2019ll admit, especially in this one, but she is so damn loyal, fierce, and she has a thirst for life I can\u2019t help but to admire. She longs to see the world, and she is finally seeing it\u2026but she can\u2019t help but to think back to the boy with one beautiful eye and one black, his face set in a perpetual frown with a little crease between his brows (Hey, I didn\u2019t say Lila was the only one who loved him\u2026.). And what better way to see him than to compete in the Essen Tasch\u2026a deadly competition showcasing magic from some of the most skilled magicians in their world-Something so dangerous only Lila would find a way into it.\n\n \u201cWhat brings you to my room?\u201d he asked, relief bleeding into annoyance. \u201cAdventure. Intrigue. Brotherly concern. Or,\u201d continued the prince lazily, \u201cperhaps I\u2019m just giving your mirror something to look at besides your constant pout.\u201dKell frowned, and Rhy smiled. \u201cAh, there it is! That famous scowl.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t scowl,\u201d grumbled Kell. \nAnd then my Kell\u2026my darling Kell. This book was hard for him, in more ways than one. He is lonely. He is tortured from the events in the previous installment (subtly so, but still there). He has a restlessness inside him that is unparalleled to anything he has ever felt before. And, now more than ever, he feels like he doesn\u2019t belong with the family he was brought into\u2026only Rhy makes him feel as he always has-Like a brother. They love each other so intensely, and it is beautiful to see-and then I just love their banter\u2026.it keeps Kell grounded and gives Rhy joy to make the forever frowning Kell smile or laugh. \n \u201cHow subtle,\u201d said Kell tonelessly.\u201cYou could at least pretend to be grateful.\u201d\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t have picked something a little more\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026imposing? A serpent? A great beast? A bird of prey?\u201d\u201cA bloody handprint?\u201d retorted Rhy. \u201cOh, what about a glowing black eye?\u201dKell glowered. \nBut my point in saying all that is he and Rhy are closer than ever *insert eye brow raise here* but there is something darker inside them, something that makes it harder to be who they once were. They feel the gravity of it weighing them down each passing day-They are beginning to feel suffocated and have no way to release it. \nBut Kell would do literally anything for his brother, something we saw many times in the last book, but we now see that Rhy would do the same\u2026and it warmed my soul. \nHe tipped his chin up so the men could see his eyes, and took a measure of grim satisfaction as the color bled from their faces. And then footsteps sounded, and Kell turned to find more men pouring into the alley. Drunk and angry and armed. Something stirred in him.His heart raced, and magic surged through his veins. He felt something on his face, and it took him a moment to realize he was smiling.\nIt was so hard to see how deeply Kell\u2019s loneliness went, how it effected him every moment of every day\u2026and how he buried it deep within himself so he could continue to help his brother. But when his brother comes to him with a proposition so dangerous, so deadly, so\u2026..exciting, Kell can\u2019t help but to consider it. He\u2019s an Antari\u2026so he can\u2019t compete\u2026but will they find a way around that loophole?? And, most importantly, why can\u2019t he stop thinking about his sharp-edged girl with two differently shaded brown eyes with a knack for knives, thievery, and trouble\u2026and why does he see her in every little person, shadow, and alley?\n \u201cHello,\u201d said Lila.\u201cHello,\u201d said Kell. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201dLila smirked. \u201cWhy, did you miss me?\u201dKell opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again before finally managing to answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \n\nThis story was naturally made for me, what with all the danger, the peril, the competition, the friendship, passion, and loyalty. I loved the pulse-pounding ending and this whole story, really, but the first admittedly holds my heart, if I\u2019m being honest. I just wanted people to know-the first may not be everyone\u2019s favorite-but it\u2019s mine *shrugs* I can\u2019t help it!!! I just adore first books SO MUCH!!! But, more than that, Kell makes this series for me. I love the writing, the atmosphere, everything about it\u2026.but Kell keeps me coming back because I adore every little thing about him. He would do anything for his brother Rhy\u2026.but he would for Lila, too. He\u2019d risk his life a million times over for them, and my heart swells even now as I type this out. He has my heart, and so does this series. I know I will surely die of anticipation before February 2017\u2026.but it will be completely worth the wait. And I know a certain Snake will be more than happy to finish this adventure with me. KELL!! \u2665For more of my reviews, please visit:\n\n \n \n \n \n**********************My feels for this series in GIF form...\nOMGGGGG MY POOR BOOOY!!!!! I just love this series and Kell so so much! What a cruel thing to have to wait until 2017 for the finale to this absolutely breathtaking, soul-crushing, heartbreaking series. I can't believe this series has reached me on such a deep, emotional level, but it has...I am completely obsessed with it. From it's characters to the setting to the intricate plot, there isn't a moment in either book where I haven't loved and adored it. These characters have such loyalty, such deep, heart-felt connections to those surrounding them-you just can't help but get sucked into the magic that is this world.I cannot WAIT to write a review for book two of one of my favorite series EVER!!! :PRTC (I WILL DO THIS)For more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "P ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25327841-p", "userReview": "[Alucard used to be lovers.

I quite liked A Darker Shade of Magic, well this is now 508 pages, this is going to be long, but it has a 4.32 average on goodreads so it must be good right?! Oh you fool Beth.Where do I even begin with this? If you love this book I\u2019d suggest you don\u2019t read this because I honestly couldn\u2019t stand it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been so let down by a second book in a series since Glass Sword, and we all know how that went. I just don\u2019t understand how it went from good, to bad? Characters I liked I now cannot stand, but we will get to that later.What is the second book about? Well there\u2019s a trial, and other characters are introduced, but seriously. I didn\u2019t start this book for a bit because this is 508 pages. What happened in those 508 pages? Well let me tell you this, for the first 300 pages NOTHING HAPPENED! Why on earth did it take so long for something\u2026 ANYTHING to happen?! I honestly just can\u2019t. I thought oooh we will get to see training, see other things happen, but WAIT it took 375 pages for us to get a glimpse into Lila\u2019s training, and even then it was about a page and a half. I seriously went into this with high hopes, and I came away thinking I\u2019ve read 300 pages of filler, 100 pages of Trials, 50 pages of filler and then 58 pages of tension. Even then there wasn't enough of the trials to be fun/engaging.Can I just also point out that this is supposed to be magical and have four Londons to me that is a selling point and unique, so why on earth did we only really see Red London? It really really annoys me that we get slight, and very small glimpses into the other Londons. I\u2019m just so meh about it all.CharactersFirstly we have Kell now don\u2019t get me wrong, I still really like Kell as a character, and at times I felt so sorry for him, but he was tiptoeing around everything and didn\u2019t want to hurt Rhy. He is supposed to be one of if not THE most powerful magician, and we didn\u2019t really see that. I love how much he cares for Rhy, I really do, but he can\u2019t stop living his life when Rhy does as he pleases anyway.Then we have Lila. My god. I was just so infuriated by her throughout the entirety of the book. She\u2019s a know it all who won\u2019t listen to what others tell her. How long has she been part of the magic world? 4 months, yet she just thinks she knows everything. I love sarcastic characters, I really do. However this time around, I honestly was so done with her and had, had enough of it all. My issues are, how did she become pretty fluent in a language she didn\u2019t know 4 months ago, why does she think she\u2019s better than everyone else. If I hear one more time \u201cI\u2019m not like other/most girls\u201d so help me god. What is \u201cother/most girls\u201d EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. You are not under any circumstances a precious snowflake. (Thanks Katie!)Alucard\u2026 I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ve spelt his name right, but what was the point in his character other than to flirt and to be someone part of the trials?We do not, I repeat DO NOT get enough of Holland the one character who is mysterious we get nothing on.So\u2026 hmmmm what did I actually like?- The mystery to Ojka- A teeny tiny glimpse into Black London, and this other thing in it, I have no idea what it\u2019s called- Rhy choosing Kells flag, and asking if it should of been a black eye (it made me laugh okay, I needed something)- HASTRA IS TOO PRECIOUS AND I LIKED HIM VERY VERY MUCH!- The bloody cliffhanger, okay I can\u2019t deny it.What I didn\u2019t like?- Pretty much 80% of the book.- Why did Lila annoy me so much in this book, my eye feels like it\u2019s going to start twitching with rage- Everything pretty much above.Overall, severely let down by this one, for me it had the second book syndrome and I\u2019m jus like right, how do I get my life back now? I\u2019m going to finish the final book in the series and hope it\u2019s better than this one.Yeah, I am salty AF right now, it can\u2019t be helped.

But they make an immensely entertaining team. Such exclusive characters this book has! -I love Jinnar already! Love his name! I like his element. His physical discrpition had me like, WOW!! The whole conversation between him and Alucard was very amusing. I was dying laughing the whole time. The very first thing Alucard says to him is;\"They let you out in public?\" LOL-I freaking adore Hastra (Kell's \"very handsome\" guard.) He is so cute, and funny. The other one I don't like, though i do feel bad for him. :(\"'You know, if you can rule half as well as you can lie, you're going to make an incredible King.' (Kell)Rhy's smile was a dazzling thing. 'Thank you.'\"-Okay, fine, I admit, Rhy is growing on me. \" '. . but your features are unique.''Why are you calling me ugly?' (Kell)Rhy snorted. 'We both know you're the prettiest boy at the ball.'\"-^^Lmao, i love this!!-If Kell gets caught, they are both so dead! I'm a little scared but excited. #livedangerously -I'm not the most romantic person on the this earth, but it irritates me when my main characters get separated! Gahhh!-Why does Ojka remind me of Manon Blackbeak?You know when you are starving and you only have a little bit of food, even though you want to just devour it in one bite, you try to make it last as long as you can? That's me right now with this book. I'll drag it as long as it's possible!"}], "description": "It has been four months since a mysterious obsidian stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Prince Rhy was wounded, and since the nefarious Dane twins of White London fell, and four months since the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London.Now, restless after having given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port.And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night will reappear in the morning. But the balance of magic is ever perilous, and for one city to flourish, another London must fall.", "title": "A Gathering of Shadows\n      \n          (Shades of Magic #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20764879-a-gathering-of-shadows", "average": 4.32, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1429627728l/20764879.jpg", "reviews": 8674, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7168230.V_E_Schwab", "name": "V.E.
