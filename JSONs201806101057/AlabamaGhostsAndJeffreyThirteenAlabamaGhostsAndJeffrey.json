It's a delightful collection of ghost stories in the classic folkloric tradition; tales passed down from person to person over the generations until multiple versions exist. Are they true? Maybe, maybe not, but is that really the important thing. I think it gives us insights, if not into the lives out ancestors lived, at least into the live we wished they lived. Was Henry Wells killed by lightning as some people tell, or was he a victim of Judge Lynch as others believe? Was every gallant young Confederate's death in battle a seed that grew into a tragic haunting? Probably not but it sure makes thinking about it interesting.The only thing that would make these stories more entertaining is if we could hear them told by Ms. Windham herself, perhaps while sitting around a fire on a dark and stormy night. Sadly she has passed on so that it a pleasure I will never experience. Well, that's not entirely true. Thanks to YouTube, many of these stories can be listened to by the author herself. Of course, you'll have to arrange the fireplace yourself."}, {"userName": "Franky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2534471-franky", "userReview": "With Halloween right around the corner, if you are looking for a great collection of ghost stories which a strong historical context 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey is a wonderful read. These ghostly tales have historical significance in various places in the South and the author has such an engaging way of setting the mood and atmosphere of each story. As other reviewers have mentioned, these stories are meant to told or read aloud, preferably with a spooky backdrop or setting. Within some of the tales are elements of tragic events that lead to ill-fated circumstances and sometimes vengeful haunts returning to a scene. \u201cThe Hole That Will Not Stay Filled\u201d was my favorite of the bunch."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14260681-tina", "userReview": "What a treasure Kathryn Tucker Windham was. I listened and watched her narrate these stories on YouTube at different \"haunted\" locations in Alabama when I was having trouble locating a copy of the actual book. I'm glad I never found the written copy. Mrs. Windham was so charming in the video and had this wonderful accent and straw hat. Thirteen Alabama Ghosts was a fun pre-Halloween read and an interesting lesson in Alabama history. I'd like to visit some of the places in this book to see if the ghosts live on."}, {"userName": "Amber Arthur", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1286603-amber-arthur", "userReview": "The first in a series of old-fashioned, Southern storytelling by Mrs. Katherine Tucker Windham.I was so honored to listen to her speak at my college my senior. Her stories are filled with even more life when presented orally.I read this book in the 5th grade. After reading the first tale, I was hooked.Usually a scaredy cat, I was hesitant to check the book out. But our teacher had recommended that we read the book since Mrs. Windham was gaining noteriety as a Southern woman writer and as a journalist/photo journalist during the Civil Rights movement.Being all of 10 years old, I refused to read the book at night. Out of fear my old Victorian house would become haunted. Compared to the entire series, this book had several less-than-captivating stories. The two favorites that come to mind are: \"Huntingdon College's Red Lady\" and \"The Face in the Courthouse Window\".Scary stuff for a 10 year old!Now, at 23, I cherish the spark this series instilled in me. To appreciate local history and tradition, and to always be curious.A lot can be learned by a culture from it's folklore. And the South was lucky enough to have those tales documented by Mrs. Windham."}, {"userName": "Lesley Looper", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1674575-lesley-looper", "userReview": "I grew up enjoying hearing Kathryn Tucker Windham tell storied in my elementary classrooms!

I bought this book to read more in-depth about the stories I heard and to read those I never knew about. It brought back great memories of being scared out of my wits as a 12 year-old at cheerleading camp at Huntingdon College and driving through Aliceville and seeing the face in the courthouse window. So much nostalgia. I can't wait to share these stories with my kids. Good Southern folklore."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8085705-vicki", "userReview": "This is basically mandated reading if you grew up in Alabama. Miss Windham would make guest appearances at our grade schools and share some special stories about Jeffrey. Children that grew up in that era felt like they had actually met Jeffrey. The books chilled me when I read the stories and I find them still just as entertaining and believable today. Each story is accompanied by a picture or drawing of the house or location of the haunting. It is a very exciting book to read."}, {"userName": "Maxine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3097697-maxine", "userReview": "A series of quaint true ghost stories. She's a very straightforward storyteller, not much for creative embellishments. This doesn't seem unlike other ghost story compilations I've read (and there are many, I have a collection), so its about average for me.
