Nora, understandably, had some trouble with this, and the result is a thoroughly frustrating heroine who jumps to insane conclusions based on inane evidence one moment, and the next goes blithely along into obvious danger.Patch is intriguing, and perhaps the most consistent character**, and I was fully prepared for an 'anti-hero as the hero' story.\u00a0 I wanted a little boundary-pushing and a not entirely likeable or trustworthy male lead who may or may not redeem himself, but who gives you the dangerous and alluring in spades.\u00a0 For the most part, Patch wasn't a let-down in this regard, and as screwed up as it is to like him, he was the stand-out character for me. (Not to say I didn't have issues with him, too.)But it wasn't enough.\u00a0 Patch's bad boy antics couldn't save this book from itself.\u00a0 It was self-indulgent, cheesy, melodramatic in the worst sense, and confusing. I wanted to like it; I loved the fallen angel premise, the idea of an anti-hero, and bits and pieces of the writing throughout.\u00a0 But Hush, Hush suffered from too many villains and too much shock and awe, and not enough thought and follow-through.\u00a0 Maybe Fitzpatrick can pull it together for round two, and with some strong convincing by trusted, like-minded people, I may be willing to give her another chance\u00a0 (never gonna happen). But this was a monstrous let-down for me.\u00a0 You've been warned.****We all know how that whole so-pretty-I-just-had-to thing works out.\u00a0 See my guest post on Jo's blog about this.**And by 'consistent' I mean he was consistently a douche. Vee was pretty consistent too, and was a lot of fun, but she started to get annoying and a little strange... ***You're still going to read it, aren't you?\u00a0 Damn you, James Porto and your beautiful, beautiful cover!***HERE THAR BE SPOILERS***If you haven't read Hush, Hush and intend to, or if you don't want me dissing the melodrama that is Patch and Nora, look away....NOW!Commence rant:You already know I had issues with this book. I think a lot of people are going to take offense to the idea of Patch as the hero, as teen girls' fantasy, just as they did with Edward in Twilight. Patch goes beyond the simple term \"bad boy\" in that yes, he does actually mean Nora harm. Consistently.I'm not going to go into that, because frankly, I don't care. He can be an anti-hero all he wants, whatever. If that's where the story's going, fine. Most of my issues -- but not all -- lie with Nora.Here's the thing:Nora is that girl you yell at in the horror movie, the idiot that goes up the stairs instead of out the door, or reaches to turn over the downed bad guy just to make sure. We all know that's frustrating, but we've come to expect it in movies, and that dumb big-breasted, scantily clad girl normally gets killed off.Nora is so much more frustrating than that. The many sides of Nora: She continually suspects Patch (and Elliot, and just about everyone else in this story), and with good reason. However, she then continually ignores her instincts and puts herself in danger. In fact, she can't seem to agree with herself. She will think to herself that Patch is stalking her and trying to kill her, and then within pages think 'Oh, but he could never hurt me.' This just cycles and cycles throughout the story.Also throughout the story, Nora makes insane jumps in logic -- whether they turn out to be true or not, it's not believable when she immediately jumps to the most bizarre conclusions and then acts on them. At the same time, she will be directly confronted with some piece of real evidence, something that would make a normal, non-fictional person take notice and say something's not right here -- and she will completely ignore it. It's like she's being willfully obtuse.Examples: * Early(ish) in the story, Nora hears a voice in her head and thinks Patch has \"breached normal communication methods and could, at will, speak to me without ever opening his mouth.\" Naturally, she thinks she's delusional. Hearing your name and a few inane comments would make one think they are imagining things, and this I could buy. Even Nora not being exactly sure what happened and being creeped out I could buy.  But she proceeds to ask Patch how he's able to speak directly to her mind, making her look like a loon. I wouldn't be even all that bothered by this, if it was consistent throughout the story; if Nora either consistently thought that she was going crazy because of all the implausible things that are happening, I could buy it; if she wanted to prove she wasn't crazy and kept confronting Patch and sleuthing, I could buy it. It would be 1 solid choice on Becca Fitzpatrick's part. She could be the ultra-paranoid girl who thinks she's going crazy and jumps to conclusions about everything. Annoying, but doable. But to present this as if it's normal...and I'm out. * Conversely, near the near the end of the story when the shit's really beginning to go down and nearly everyone has become a villain, Nora and Patch walk out of a movie theater to find that \"...both the tires on the driver's side were flat: '\"I can't believe it!\" I said. \"I drove over two nails?\"' O_O ??? She thinks she's being stalked, she thinks her best friend has been kidnapped by a teenaged murderer named Elliot, and by this point she thinks she's the target of not one but two murderous angels, and yet all she can come up with is that she ran over two nails? Come on! If Nora will jump to conclusions on the barest of evidence, how in hell does she not comprehend the obvious?  * Throughout the story, Nora thinks everyone's out to get her (she's right, but I'll get to that), especially Patch. Patch is Ominous, capital 'O', and yet...And yet, no matter how much Nora thinks he's badbadbad, she trusts him. Why? Weirdest of all, when Nora confronts Patch about his intentions, \nhe admits he wanted to kill her\n; her reaction? 'I know Patch could never hurt me' -- and she trusts him implicitly from that point on. Really? The whole story, you've suspected him and been insistent that you should stay away on the barest of evidence, but once he's confessed his (albeit previous) intentions of murder, you trust him. \nReally\n. Her sudden bizarre trust of Patch comes too late for any real belief in their romance. Or her sanity.There is no consistency in Nora's thinking. I just can't understand why Becca Fitzpatrick couldn't pick one Nora to write and stick with her. She could have just always thought she was losing her mind; self-doubt would have been interesting, and made her root-forable. If she had just been reckless and always convinced that yes, maybe something is a little off about Patch, but she still found herself attracted to him, it would have been interesting, and could have been used to slowly reveal the truth and up Nora's anxiety. If Nora had just been naive and always convinced that everything was fine despite any indicators, it would have built tension. But combining it all made Nora seem confused and a little off herself, and made the writing seem schizophrenic. Too many villains: Fitzpatrick makes the rookie mistake of lack of restraint. Nora suspects everyone, and everyone does in fact seem to be a villain. This makes the book seem unfocused and sort of cheesy. When everyone is under suspicion, and everyone seems to be a bad guy, it makes it seem like no one really is. It's like if you use a really great word once or twice it's going to stand out. But if every word you use is some great, unusual word, none are going to stand out. There's no negative space, no background to make the focal point pop. Everywhere Nora turns, someone's trying to kill her. It just gets silly after awhile. Also, it has the added negative effect of making it hard for Fitzpatrick to \"top\" as it were. Where does she go from here? If there are 4 different people trying to kill Nora in book 1, how many people will there be out for blood in book 2? She didn't leave any room to grow the suspense.Another bad thing about the amount of villains and Nora's instant suspicion (and the overall over-the-top nature of the book) was that there was precious little suspense. By giving everything away rather freely, Fitzpatrick deprived the reader of the slow build-up and the privilege of the mystery; we never got to have any suspicions of our own, or choose sides. There was too much in the way of ominous overtones, and not enough restraint.On a side note, not that I'm calling Vee a villain, but even she became a little weird* as the story went on. It's one thing to be the wild and crazy girl in the best friends dynamic, but constantly trying to get your best friend alone with a guy who she says makes her uncomfortable, who she believes broke into her house and may be stalking her, and who she knows was a murder suspect is reckless beyond the pale, and shitty, shitty friendship.*By which I mean she goes from being quirky and funny to a godawful, shitty friend. You know, for no other reason than apparently to help lure Nora into bad/ridiculous situations. Plot device: \u2611The writing overall: I saw glimpses in Fitzpatrick's writing that demonstrated how this could have been a good book. She does sexual tension and confrontation scenes fairly well, and there is some good humor. Vee -- in the beginning, at least, before she becomes a really reckless, really bad friend -- was pretty amusing as the traditional sidekick. Patch had great one-liners, both funny and smoldering. But for all the occasional good, there was quite a bit in the way of bad. The dialogue was often stilted and weird. The analogies were completely out of left field. They were those turns of phrase that you can tell were used because they sounded cool, or because one was needed, but they don't mean anything, or they leave you thinking wtf? \"His eyes looked like they didn't play by the rules.\" What does that even mean? What rules do eyes usually play by? Does he not blink? This is a mild example, but I got sick of making note of them. I got this really hit-and-miss feel about the writing and the language in the book. Pieces of literary crap mixed in with the really good bits blended to form a \"throw it all in and something's bound to work\" style. A total lack of finesse made it hard to want to keep reading -- and made me feel like if I kept rolling my eyeballs, they were going to roll right out of my head.Rant complete."}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "How I Would Have Ended It*This post was inspired by the fan\u00adtas\u00adtic videos over at www.howitshouldhaveended.com.

It\u2019s the rea\u00adson I came to school. I had to get close to you. I needed you. It\u2019s the rea\u00adson I walked into your life.\u201dI looked at him for a moment, his intense gaze shoot\u00ading through me as I con\u00adsid\u00adered the infor\u00adma\u00adtion he\u2019d just confirmed.\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, straight\u00aden\u00ading up and slip\u00adping out from his over\u00adbear\u00ading pres\u00adence to put some space between us.\u201cOkay?\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t go!\u201d Patch said, his face twist\u00ading into a con\u00adfused expression.\u201cWell, you\u2019ve pretty much admit\u00adted that you were going to kill me, in a very per\u00adsonal way, might I add. I think that jus\u00adti\u00adfies a quick and hasty exit,\u201d I spat at him, straight\u00aden\u00ading my out\u00adfit in indig\u00adna\u00adtion and stand\u00ading up to him with more con\u00adfi\u00addence than I felt.Patch splut\u00adtered for a moment, blink\u00ading his eyes dis\u00adbe\u00adliev\u00adingly. \u201cBut\u2026 I wasn\u2019t\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d he looked lost for a moment before vis\u00adi\u00adbly col\u00adlect\u00ading him\u00adself and slip\u00adping back into his usual, con\u00adfi\u00addent demeanor. \u201cYou want me to come clean, I will. I\u2019ll tell you every\u00adthing. Who I am and what I\u2019ve done. Every last detail. I\u2019ll dig it all up, but you have to ask. You have to want it. You can see who I was, or you can see who I am now. I\u2019m not good,\u201d he said, pierc\u00ading me with eyes that absorbed all light but reflected none, \u201cbut I was worse.\u201dI arched an eye\u00adbrow and stared at him in dis\u00adbe\u00adlief. \u201cWell, I have a dif\u00adfer\u00adent plan, Patch. Mainly revolv\u00ading around the fact that you pur\u00adposely entered my life in order to stalk, harass and mur\u00adder me for your nefar\u00adi\u00adous schemes. So I think this would be a pretty good time for you to quit the mys\u00adte\u00adri\u00adous bull\u00adshit and be extremely trans\u00adpar\u00adent about every\u00adthing I need to know. I mean, you haven\u2019t even assured me, at this point, that you\u2019re not actu\u00adally going to kill me. And I don\u2019t mean to harp on this point \u2013 but that\u2019s a pretty impor\u00adtant facet of this dis\u00adcus\u00adsion for me.\u201dHe stalked close to me again, affect\u00ading a brood\u00ading, intense expres\u00adsion and caus\u00ading my heart to thud painfully in my chest. His boots were flush with the toes of my ten\u00adnis shoes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you, Nora. I don\u2019t kill peo\u00adple who are impor\u00adtant to me. And you top the list.\u201dI exerted con\u00adsid\u00ader\u00adable effort to con\u00adtain an eye\u00adroll, but it slipped through at the last minute. \u201cYou\u2019re imping\u00ading on my pri\u00advate space,\u201d I said, inch\u00ading back\u00adward in dis\u00adtaste.Patch gave a barely-there smile. \u201cImping\u00ading? This isn\u2019t the SAT, Nora.\u201dI pressed my finger-tips to his chest. He glanced at the spot where we touched and then back up to my eyes. \u201cIf my vocab\u00adu\u00adlary is caus\u00ading you dis\u00adtress,\u201d I whis\u00adpered huskily, look\u00ading up to him with a wicked smile on my face, \u201cthen let me express my dis\u00adplea\u00adsure in the only way you seem to understand.\u201dPatch\u2019s brow creased in con\u00adfu\u00adsion a moment before my heel came down hard on his instep. He hopped back in pain, look\u00ading at me with both hurt and bewil\u00adder\u00adment. \u201cPer\u00adsonal bound\u00adaries, Patch. Respect them when I ask you to. See, I have this rule about let\u00adting would-be mur\u00adder\u00aders within ten feet of my very stab-able body. Now, tell me. Is Dabria going to be com\u00ading after me.\u201dPatch, mirac\u00adu\u00adlously less inter\u00adested in encroach\u00ading on my per\u00adsonal space, shrugged from where he was. \u201cYou could take her, Angel,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen both of you in action,\u201d he looked down at his injured foot and winked, \u201cand my bet\u2019s on you. You don\u2019t need me for that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I need you for much of any\u00adthing,\u201d I sneered, turn\u00ading on him and head\u00ading to the door.\u201cDoor\u2019s locked,\u201d he said from behind me. \u201cAnd we have unfin\u00adished business.\u201d\u201cLis\u00adten, the only unfin\u00adished busi\u00adness we have is between my knee and your crotch if you come near me again.\u201dThe cell phone in my pocket rang to life. \u201cIn fact,\u201d I said as I pulled it out, \u201cyou\u2019re going to go away and I don\u2019t ever, EVER want to see your broody, mopey face again. You have for\u00adever cured me of bad\u00adboys. When this is over, it\u2019s strictly account\u00ading nerds and bank\u00ading types for me! This was absolutely the WORST way to pun\u00adish my mother for her absence, assert my inde\u00adpen\u00addence and act out my grief from los\u00ading my father. I should have just stolen money from my mother\u2019s purse and bought alco\u00adhol like a NORMAL teenager!\u201d I pressed the accept but\u00adton on my cell. \u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cBabe!\u201d Vee said.

Are you still with Elliot and Jules?\u201d I flat\u00adtened a hand against my free ear to hear better.\u201cI\u2019m at school. We broke in,\u201d she said in a voice that was naughty to per\u00adfec\u00adtion. \u201cWe want to play hide-and-seek but don\u2019t have enough peo\u00adple for two teams. So\u2026 do you know of a fourth per\u00adson who could come play with us?\u201dAn inco\u00adher\u00adent voice mum\u00adbled in the background.\u201cElliot wants me to tell you that if you don\u2019t come be his part\u00adner \u2013hang on- what?\u201d Vee said into the background.Elliot\u2019s voice came on. \u201cNora? Come play with us. Oth\u00ader\u00adwise, there\u2019s a tree in the com\u00admon area with Vee\u2019s name on it.\u201dI groaned in dis\u00adbe\u00adlief and promised myself that if I sur\u00advived this, I\u2019d choose friends who weren\u2019t com\u00adplete and utter dumbasses.\u201cWho was that?\u201d Patch asked.I sighed heav\u00adily. \u201cThat was my brain\u00adless, drop\u00adkick friend phon\u00ading me to pass along the mes\u00adsage that Elliot and Jules are going to mur\u00adder her vio\u00adlently unless I go meet up with them.\u201d\u201cWhat was that you were say\u00ading about never again see\u00ading my broody, mop\u00ading face?\u201d Patch asked, his con\u00adfi\u00addence returned tri\u00adfold and an enor\u00admous grin spread across his face.I resisted the urge to smash my face into the tiled wall repeat\u00adedly. \u201cOh, shut up and come on.

And now I want to look it in the eye and ask - REALLY, BOOK? REALLY? Because it doesn't just cross the line into the uncomfortably creepy territory - it takes a cosmic leap over it.Hush, Hush may have the dubious distinction of being the worst book I've ever read. (I assumed it's a book since that's what you'd call a bunch of printed and bound pages, but I'm really applying the term 'book' loosely here). Yes, I know I'm not the intended audience, but should terribly written books that can only aspire to reach the same literary heights as the word-of-the-day toilet paper even HAVE a target audience??? Yes, I'm being harsh. But I'm also being honest. Let me give you a sample of my complaints (all of them would be longer than the allowed review space).This book reads as though someone read Twilight, appreciated the obviously marketable and profitable premise, and decided to rewrite it in an \"edgier\" way - which boiled down to clumsily asking a question, \"What did Twilight lack?\" and coming up with the answer, \"Sexual creepiness bordering on sexual harrassment. That's it. LLLLLLadies.\"\nMeet Nora Grey, an 'average' high-schooler who meets a mysterious boy Patch in biology. By the way, my (future hypothetical) daughter will not be allowed to take high school biology since that's where all potential supernatural creeps appear to lurk, looking for gullible teenage-girl prey. The boy acts like a total jerk to her, and his sleazy innuendos are alarming and appalling but not charming or witty or sexy. The natural things to do would be: (a) tell him off, (b) tell the school officials, and (c) call the police if the d-bag does not stop harrassing you. Instead, Nora Grey decides to madly fall in love with the jerk. (*)* Dear teenage girls! \"He hates me - therefore it means he loves me\" approach does not work in real life. While we're at it - PEOPLE WANTING TO KILL YOU IS NOT SEXY EITHER. Dear YA authors, please stop perpetuating this idiocy. Patch is a fallen angel (no spoilers, it was stated on page one or so) with a dark past. But basically he is an entitled arrogant jerk who appears to take immense pleasure in publicly humiliating Nora, physically forcing himself on her, physically intimidating her, ignoring her wishes, and gloating in his dripping douchebaggery approach while nearly sexually assaulting her in front of the class. \u201cI make you uneasy?\u201d he asks. The proper answer would be to scream, \"YES! NOW BACK AWAY!!!!\"** **But for some inexplicable reason Nora is in love with the creep. For some inexplicable reason, his appalling behavior is presented as alluring and seductive. For some inexplicable reason, he is presented as a \"dark and dangerous\" man of every girl's dream. WHYYYYYYYYYYY????? Oh nevermind, here's the answer: \"Yes, actually, he had that effect on me. He also had the tendency to wipe all logical thought from my mind.\"\"My brain couldn\u2019t process one logical thought.\"\nThis may explain why we get pages and pages of this incoherent lovestruck bumbling masquerading as a book! Mystery solved, my job here is done.**********************************While I'm on the soapbox, let me say this - STALKING IS NOT SEXY. STALKING IS NOT OKAY. STALKING IS NOT LOVE. VIOLATING PRIVACY IS NOT LOVE EITHER and should result in a restraining order  You see, our wonderful Nora thinks it's perfectly okay to learn about the mysterious new boy by breaking into the students' records office to look at the confidential file (she does it by calling in a bomb threat - which is (a) awful, (b) promptly forgotten about and never followed up on), and spying at him at work, snooping for information from his coworkers. I hate the message this book is sending.***********************************I hate punctuation abuse. It's innocent, so stop torturing it.

Why am I subjected to the endless details of what exactly the characters are ordering in a Mexican restaurant, what the specials are, and how long it takes a waitress to bring the order?

It's awful.*****************************Hey, what with not having the slightest trust in the readers' ability to figure things out? What's with the dropping of anvil-sized hints every few pages?

Trust me.*****************************But in the end, despite the awfulness, I cannot be upset at Nora - mainly because I'm really worried about that girl's health. Here's why:\n\"My heart fumbled a beat [...]\"\"My heartbeat turned erratic, and I told myself to pull it together.\"\"My heart did an unexpected flip, startled by his bizarrely attractive smile.\"\nNora, you know what you need instead of a creepy boyfriend? A cardiology consult.

And like all science, the best approach is to learn by sleuthing. For the rest of the class, practice this technique by finding out as much as you can about your new (seating assignment) partner. Tomorrow, bring your write-up of your discoveries, and believe me, I\u2019m going to check for authenticity\u2026I want to see real interaction and teamwork.\u201d This is a biology class! Teaching kids how to get to know one another reflects the teaching of the science of human reproduction how???? The next day, class focuses on what qualities each student looks for in a \u201cpotential mate\u201d and the nuances of body language when hitting on someone. Again, this is Bio! Not health, not ~ well I don\u2019t know what cause I never took a class this ridiculous. But I took a lot of sciences, and this ain\u2019t it. Later on in the book, the Bio class is \u201crunning a lab on blood pressure.\u201d Uh\u2026 that has nothing to do with high school biology! And even less to do with human reproduction. WTF? Furthermore, in the blood pressure lab, \u201cVee is lying faceup on a table.\u201d Argh! Those lab tables are filthy. Chemicals, dissections\u2026 kids are not allowed to sit on them, much less lay on them. And, really unless you are checking orthostatic BP, there is really no need to lie down for five minutes before hand! All I can say is that Becca Fitzpatrick must have been homeschooled. Later, Nora approaches her Bio teacher about switching her seat away from Patch because he makes her feel uncomfortable.  The teacher not only ignores her plea, but enlists her to tutor Patch. This all takes place right after Patch is seriously sexually harassing Nora in class, in front of the teacher and seemingly with the teacher\u2019s encouragement. More support for the homeschooled theory!Nora is driving home one night, and approaches a traffic light. The light turns yellow and Nora, \u201d\u2026rolled to a stop, checked to see that traffic was clear, then pulled into the intersection.\u201d What the hell? Who stops at a yellow light to see if traffic is clear?? Why wouldn\u2019t it be when the other side still has a red light? I\u2019m guessing that Fitzpatrick has never owned a driver\u2019s license. Ever. A rollercoaster called The Archangel. Do people at a park really give a crap about biblical lore? Furthermore, the car Nora & Patch ride in has a \u201cgrouping of four paintings\u201d depicting an angels\u2019 fall from grace. Don\u2019t all rollercoasters have large flashy graphics that can be seen from a distance & look cool when speeding around the track? Since when do they sport fairly intricate and thoughtful artwork? A local paper reported that Elliot Saunders, a 16yr old kid, was the last person to be seen with a girl before her body was found, and therefore was held & questioned for her murder.  So, in addition to being a non-driving, homeschooled, amusement park avoider\u2026 Fitzpatrick is clearly unaware of laws protecting minors in this country. The article continues to state that Elliot was released after a suicide note was found in the victim\u2019s apartment. There are no further news stories regarding this matter. Nevertheless, Nora persists in believing that there is a \u201cmurder investigation surrounding Elliot.\u201d And this girl has hopes of getting into an Ivy league school???? Nora has the police at her house for a 911 call, and again to question her about an attack on a fellow student. Nora\u2019s mother is never informed of the police visits, despite the fact that Nora is a minor. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, because it has already been established that Fitzpatrick has no understanding of laws pertaining to minors. Nora sees Patch\u2019s bare back and notices that, \u201dTwo thick gashes ran the length of it. They started near his kidneys, and ended at his shoulder blades, widening to form an upside down V.\u201d Is it just me?!?! If an upside down V extends from the kidneys to the shoulder blades, it will NARROW not widen!!!!! Right? Fitzpatrick could have written that the gashes started at his shoulder blades, and extended to his kidneys as they widened to form an upside down V. But the way it\u2019s written? It doesn\u2019t make sense! Furthermore, the kidneys are pretty much right below the shoulder blades, not further out from them. Yeah, I\u2019m nitpicking. The final irrational aspect of hush, hush is Nora herself .She is na\u00efve, spineless, and a horrible and chronic liar. When she doesn\u2019t want to do something, she will make up lame excuse after lame excuse\u2026 even when she gets called out for her excuses, she never has the balls to simply say, \u201cI am not interested in having dinner/date/whatever with you.\u201d She just continues to make up excuses ~ never comes clean or sticks up for herself. When Patch is attempting to corner & kiss her, Nora tells him to go. When he doesn\u2019t, she says, \u201cMy legs are falling asleep\u201d What? Who says that?! Lord, if you want him to go and he doesn\u2019t then TELL HIM AGAIN! BUT DON\u2019T MAKE UP SOME LAME ASS EXCUSE! No wonder people walk all over Nora and take advantage of her! Nora is so frightened of Patch, that there is even a scene where he is playing cat and mouse with her ~ chasing her around a parked car, until she breaks out in a run, only to be caught by him in a matter of seconds. But despite her fear, she never tells him NO. I don\u2019t take issue with Patch. Really. He is thousands of years old (presumably), isn\u2019t human, and for some reason has developed a crush on a very immature teen. So I actually expect him to mess with her a little bit. But dumbass Nora actually allows him to manipulate her. Not that she deserves it (although, really she does!) but Nora does nothing to defend herself against Patch, Elliot, Vee\u2026 anyone! She loses control of every conversation and interaction she participates in. And still manages to come out the \u201cheroine.\u201d Whatever! Had Nora grown or changed as a result of her experiences, I could have forgiven her. Or if Nora had suffered some severe consequences as a result of her stupidity, I could have forgiven Fitzpatrick. As it is\u2026I\u2019m considering destroying this library book and facing the repurcussions of a library black mark (or god forbid ban!) all in the name of saving young, impressionable teen girls from thinking Nora is the sort of protagonist to look up to. Even Bella Swan is more admirable.

I read some nice fluffy paranormal crap, sung myself into a subconscious lull, and then eventually fell into deep, drooling sleep.You guessed it. This is a dream story.Now, I rarely remember my dreams. But last night's was so freaking pungent that I can reel it all off right now without missing any details. Also, bear in mind that absolutely everything I'm about to tell you is one hundred per cent true. I never lie on Goodreads, because telling the truth is just so much more fun.So it starts off with me in some kind of medieval town. I'm blonde, which is a change. The \"camera angle\" is third person, but I know that's me in the blue dress. For some reason, it occurs to me that my name is Bess, and for some reason I'm carrying a weapon, like a knife. I don't actually see the knife; I'm just aware of it.So I step up in front of this shop, and suddenly the place looks more wild west. Some guy goes to attack me, but I totally ninja him and then leap down off the verandah, into a waiting crowd. They all part and then the guy I supposedly killed stands up again and yells, \"You're a Pagan!\" Then I yell, in my own voice (and accent), \"Don't come after me! These children [points to a group of forlorn children in front of me, all wearing blue] will get you! There are more over there, in that crowd!\"Then I run away, there's all this rushing, and then for some reason I'm suddenly running along this farm track, like a muddy road. The viewpoint's in full first person now. Think Bioshock. The atmosphere is sort of chalky and dark, something like Sleepy Hollow, and I'm running and running, but it's dream running, so I'm not really getting anywhere. You know dream running; you need to move, and there's something really fucking horrible chasing you, but for the life of you you can't make your legs move any faster than they would if they were coated in tar. So I'm dream running, and then suddenly the word, \"Samhain*\" pops into my head and then I think, \"Wait a minute! My name is Samhain!\"No, I don't even bother to question this. I keep trying to run, and when I look behind me, I see a fork in the road, and men in American civil war uniforms on horses, parting down the fork in the road. I keep trying to dream run, but it's pretty fucking useless, because one of the guys catches up. I dart off the road, into a fir tree, but I'm terrible at hiding and I get caught. The guy yells, \"Samhain!\" and then an old guy comes riding down the road on this tiny little horse and carriage, from the opposite direction, and starts shooting me with what I imagine was a BB gun. He has the creepiest expression on his face, I'm flinching, because I think I'm going to get hit, but somehow I don't. Yeah.A second later I'm back in some town square, and I'm wearing a bright orange bonnet that's too tight. It's made of thick, glossy paper, and it crosses my mind to be careful that the edge of it doesn't slit my throat. Why am I so paranoid? I'm not restrained, but I don't make a run for it. Everyone's chanting \"Samhain! Samhain!\" and then I do the creepiest thing I have ever done in a dream, ever. I laugh. But it's this really loud Joker laugh, except ten times crazier, and my voice is all masculine. I'm cackling, basically, as they lead me to this huge sandstone building that looks like the Volturi clock tower from the New Moon movie (yeah, I saw it. Castrate me). I'm still screaming with manic laughter as they take me down all these torchlit flights of stairs and I start getting pretty fucking scared, because I see all these shadows flitting around and little wispy lights and shit, and then I get locked in this cell, and we're back to medieval times with this one. I bang on the door, yelling in a girly voice again, apparently trying to laugh it off as I say, \"Come on, man! This is like false imprisonment!\"So the door opens and the guy says something that I can't remember, then he randomly falls down the stairs. When he hits the bottom step, he's miraculously changed into a woman with long, braided hair, and this crazy look of astonishment. I'm apparently unfazed by watching someone die, and I step over him/her, and make my way back up all the winding twisty staircases. Yeah, the shadows and creepy things are back, and I'm pretty fucking freaked out by the time I reach this polished ballroom, that looks like it has laminate flooring, and big windows. I walk past it, up a flight of stairs that look like the moving staircases in the Harry Potter movies, and on to this loft area that has windows that look on to a huge abyss with floating platforms hanging over it. The windows have blue velvet curtains, and no glass. They're sandstone. Ever been to the Wallace Monument? That's what the windows are like. Except at the Wallace Monument, they don't have curtains. Whatever.To my left are two people sitting on a bench. There's a smirking woman wearing modern clothes and a big leather handbag, and a man, but he's blurry. The woman stands up and stalks past me, and the man stays where he is. In front of the window nearest to me is a man in grey/brown clothes, reaching out to two women who sit on the nearest floating platform. One is this really, really pale little girl, with a chubby kind of face and scraped back white hair, and the other is an older woman who reminds me of Vittoria from Angels and Demons. I walk up to them and suddenly the curtain starts moving by itself, and it gets pulled out into the abyss by what I can only imagine is some kind of ghost, and then pale girl starts shrieking and her fingers go like claws and she clamps her hand over Vittoria-look-a-like's face. Vittoria screams silently, and then I approach, and the man says something, and the girl slumps forward, pouting her lips and crying a little. Vittoria seems suddenly fine, and we all crouch over the pale girl, trying to make her feel better. Then I wake up. And when I do, \"You Are My Sunshine\" is playing on a loop in my head. I'm actually humming it.Look, you can't make that shit up. And that statement is why Becca Fitzpatrick fascinates me: because Hush, Hush makes less sense than my dream, yet somehow, she managed to conjure it all up with her naked little mind. Well, not naked. It hardly takes a YA aficionado to notice the glaringly obvious Twilight catch-and-releases. But look at my dream, then look at Hush, Hush. Okay, so my name was Samhain. Beck's hero's name is Patch. So I got locked in a tower, presumably for being a Pagan. Nora goes all Cagney-and-Lacey, and goes undercover to stalk her tormenter at his workplace. Her costume was in a 7-Eleven bag, for fuck's sake! This stuff is totally pumped up, man! How much weed did Becks smoke before she wrote this shit? Seriously!Look, pretty much everything that needs to be said about Nora already has been. My flash-in-the-pan Bess was more badass than her, and she had a bunch of children watching her back. Honestly? Nora is so fucking stupid, I'm surprised she's even been allowed to live. I'm amazed her mother hasn't already taken a chainsaw to her. She's that frakkin' dense. I've been hard-pressed to find a protagonist that's as completely insufferable as her, and I've read Halo.Yes. What does that say? It says that I have a pretty high shit threshold, and yet Hush, Hush managed to piss me off enough to warrant this review. Yuh-huh.Now, on to my next slab of beef: Edward Patch. Not too long ago, my sister and I were exiting the supermarket, when some old dude reached out and slapped her ass. I screamed a bunch of swear words at him (I was about fourteen at the time) and hauled her away. She felt violated, and I was so angry I thought my jugular was going to pop.Now, Patch is exactly the kind of guy who would do that. He'd pinch your ass when you weren't looking. He'd rub himself up against you on the subway. He'd bang you up against your own kitchen cabinets and dry-hump you when you barely knew him, and had already said no. He'd pin you down on a bed, tell you he wants nothing more than to kill you, then kiss you.In short: Patch is a chauvinistic prick. He's a rapist in the making* He is a rapist. He has absolutely no loving feelings for the protagonist; he simply wants to bone her. Probably to death.*\"in the making\" was a stupid thing for me to say. Patch is not \"in the making\". He is made. He is a rapist, and though you've probably already read this post through a hundreds of links to it all over Goodreads, I'm going to relink it here just to catch the stragglers who didn't give it a glance.Look, it's all been said. But this is YA rape culture at it's very worst. This is dressing up sexual harassment as love, then shoving it down the throats of young teens. A dangerous game, no?Is simply putting up with sexual harassment in the classroom really something we want to teach today's teen population? Male or female? What begins in the classroom moves to the workplace, leisure time and eventually, more frighteningly, the home. Patch and Nora's relationship is built around her being terrifed of him, while he fantasizes about killing her. He outright TELLS her that he wants to kill her. On every level, this relationship is heinously unhealthy and extremely dangerous, and nothing anyone should ever aspire to. I see polls all over Goodreads where Patch is rated as the best hero, hottest love interest, best angel. Are you fucking serious? Really?It is sexual harrassment and intimidation, sexual objectification, powerful misogyny and a clear prelude to rape. If a lover, partner or spouse threatens your life, terrorizes you, humiliates you, belittles you, touches you when you do not wish to be touched, makes lewd/unwanted comments about your body, chases you around your car when you just want to go home, then that person is an immediate danger to you. Or--no. Forget all those things, because it's as simple as this: If you say no, and a partner or spouse refuses to accept that, THEN THAT PERSON IS AN IMMEDIATE DANGER TO YOU.Please. Don't EVER put up with behaviour like this. And don't EVER praise Patch as a character for displaying blatant traits of a psychopathic serial rapist/killer. Don't come here and try to convince me that Patch is perfect, a sexy bad boy, because I don't want to fucking hear it. I'm not interested in whatever praise anyone has for this horrifying rape fantasy.Whenever I open this book and try desperately to see what everyone finds sexy, all I can think about is the man who grabbed at my sister, or the man who tried to dry-hump me at a concert while the people with him laughed, or the men who hang out of their car windows and honk at me when I'm walking down the street, panting about my body.Women, do you think this is the way you deserve to be treated? I sincerely hope not. Also, Fitzpatz, did you ever go to high school? Did you ever set foot in a classroom? How could you possibly, when you portray a biology class as discussing what they look for in a \"mate\". What the fuck? Biology class isn't for talking about makes us horny. And it sickens me that throughout this lesson, Nora is visibly uncomfortable as Patch talks about her body, humiliates her and puts her on the spot in front of everyone, and the surrounding class and teacher simply laugh at her. Nora then asks the teacher to relocate her because she is uncomfortable with Patch, but this has the opposite effect: she is assigned to tutor him. She gives in, because why wouldn't she? Women being persistent is practically synonymous in our society with \"whiny\". And what better way, Fitzpatz, to show us how to deal with feeling this way than waving a big loud banner that says, \"SUCK IT UP\".SUCK IT UP if you feel like you are being objectified. SUCK IT UP if a man humiliates you in public. SUCK IT UP if you're being harrassed, bullied, threatened. SUCK IT UP if someone terrifies you.I read this book three years ago, and I am still completely and utterly disgusted by it. It's a shambles. It's appalling in absolutely every way.I could go into Vee, but frankly I'd rather poke needles through my tongue than spend any time evaluating this piece of walking, agreeing cardboard being passed off as a character. Of course, being fat, Vee is the butt of all jokes, and Nora is constantly commenting on her weight as if that's the only thing worth knowing about this girl who is supposed to be Nora's best friend, but is in fact an enabler who enjoys watching Patch treat Nora like shit. She literally encourages Nora to go after Patch, even after Nora tells her that she's uncomfortable around him and she doesn't enjoy his company.What did I say before? SUCK IT UP. That's Vee's dialogue in a nutshell. \"Feeling harrassed, Nora? Feeling stalked? Well, SUCK IT UP. You're a woman, only there for his entertainment. Stop pretending not to be.\"I'll round off my Vee tirade with this little heteronormative, transphobic tidbit:\"Boys like girls who look like...girls.\"Oh, lovely. Just lovely.This book is also dreadfully written. I mean, really. Just because this is YA, doesn't mean it has to be stuffed full up purple prose, fucked-up metaphors, stupid dialogue, pointless descriptions and cheesy fight scenes. Honestly? A chimpanzee could have done a better job on this book's prose. An editor would have been a good help, too. It would have been nice to have avoided laundry-list character descriptions and \"eyes that don't play by the rules\". What the fuck?To conclude: I'll never Be Nice when it comes to your work, Becca. I just can't. A book that perpetuates rape culture and inflicts characters like Vee on the world of literature does not deserve my compassion. This is a great big steaming turd, end of. I'd rather eat all of my shoes than put myself through this torture again.Basically? Fuck. You. Book. The silver lining? Mine's paperback. Got it at Tesco cheapitty-cheap. Hurrah!And now...BONUS TIME!Haw, yeah!Why?'Cause I can. That's why.*Samhain is a Pagan harvest celebration that takes place on October 31st. Animal sacrifices are offered to gods and evil spirits are warded off by participants wearing frightening costumes and making jack-o-lanterns. It draws some elements from the Festival of the Dead, similar to the Day of the Dead, which is celebrated in Mexico. Basically, it's old-time halloween."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "This book is simply appalling. I won't lie, my expectations going in about this book were pretty low. But even so, \"Hush, Hush\" managed to disappoint me.First, there are many similarities with \"Twilight\" - you have a regular average girl here, absent parents, a love affair with a dangerous supernatural boyfriend, a final showdown with a villain of his own kind. The mythology, while somewhat unusual (I haven't read anything about fallen angels in YA so far), is paper thin. The characters are shallow and undeveloped (BTW, Vee is the dumbest character I've read about maybe ever). But this is not even what makes this book a barely tolerable read. This book is just plain silly, and silly not in a cute-and-funny way, but more in it's-pretty-dumb-and-dangerous-to-fall-for-this-crap way. Many things are just so contrived about the story, I got a headache rolling my eyes while reading it. For instance: a bomb threat to steal an empty personal file that nobody investigates later? a biology class which is centered on discussing one uncomfortable and almost harassed student's sexual attractiveness? why would a mother whose husband was murdered leave her 16-year old daughter alone in a remote house for weeks at a time? why would parents of another teenage girl let her go out NEXT DAY after she had surgery following a violent attack on her? dressing up like a hooker to get some dirt on a guy you are investigating? why would an angel fall for loving a human and then get his wings back while loving another human? And finally, why exactly Patch and Nora are in love? They know nothing about each other. Even more, Nora spends most of the book calling Patch creepy, being scared of him, being roughly pinned by him to various walls in dark places or being at his knife's point, and yet she is full of desire for him? It just makes no sense. As for Patch, I don't know one thing about him or why he loves Nora. My list can go on and on...But surely enough, teenage girls will eat this story up. You have everything for success here: a fabulous cover and font, and pages and pages of flirtatious banter filled with sexual innuendos (very often bordering on sexual harassment) fit for 30-year olds and not 10-graders.I am rarely for any kind of censorship of books, but reading nonsense like \"Hush, Hush\" makes me wonder: what are these writers thinking? In my opinion, YA writers should be held to a higher standard than your usual writers of adults fiction. Why would they want to promote such outright disturbing relationships as normal to impressionable and silly teenage girls? In my book, the relationship between Patch and Nora is not simply shallow, but dangerous. I wish some of the authors exercised better judgment writing their books, otherwise they are setting up many-many girls for a lot of disappointment, because whatever is presented in this book as romantic is disturbing at best in real life. Well, to sum this tirade up, \"Hush, Hush\" is pretty much a book that gives YA literature a bad name. Naturally, the sequel is in works, but surely enough, I won't be reading it. I'd rather dedicate my time to something better written and less contrived and misguided.Reading challenge: #1 - F"}, {"userName": "Etnik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-etnik", "userReview": "____________________________________________\u201cKeep in mind that people change, but the past doesn't.\u201d____________________________________________\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u26064 HUSHY STARS!\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\nYou can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!Okay so before reading this,I heard a lot of mixed feelings about this series.Some loved it,some liked it and some hated it.Now before I start my review I want to say that even that I heard a lot of things I was not spoiled or didn't even know anything about the plot or story so it was a fresh new start for me.____________________________________________\u201cYou smell good, too,\u201d said PatchIt\u2019s called a shower.\u201d I was staring straight ahead.

But if I hadn't fallen, I wouldn't have met you.\u201d ____________________________________________The beginning was good,also the middle but the ending was great.My favorite scene was the light out school scene.It reminded me a scene from 'Teen Wolf' the TV series.It was greatly described and that was the only moment I didn't know what was going to happen,even though it ended fast.____________________________________________\u201cCheshvan starts tonight,\" Rixon said, \"What are you doing arsing around in a graveyard?\"\"Thinking.\"\"Thinking?\"\"A process by which I use my brain to make a rational decision.\u201d ____________________________________________The writing style is not bad but it is not great either.I was simple like a lot of novels out there.The characters are also good but not the ones you remember for long.And I found some of them really annoying.The story follows a girl called Nora who lives a normal life with her mom and her bestfriend Vee.One day the Couch decides to change their seats for a project and she gets to sit with Patch,a boy who rarely talked.At the first words they exchanged she felt something new inside her.She couldn't stand him because of his arrogance but also couldn't deny the feelings.Also things started to happen,new things,new people,new troubles in her life.She felt the need to learn more,more about Patch,but was she ready to know?____________________________________________\u201cBefore I forget, here's your homework.

Seriously. Do lesbians even exist in this world? This is so fucking sexist it makes me want to vomit. This is around the time Nora\u2019s being openly sexually harassed in the classroom, which pisses me off. I won\u2019t go into how stupid it is that a sports coach is teaching biology, because there are plenty of other reviews that delve into that (yes, some sports teachers do have degrees in biology blah blah blah but it\u2019s not very common and this Coach doesn\u2019t know anything about reproduction: he thinks it means the students have to find a mate RIGHT NOW). This entire class revolves around how women want strong men to protect them and bring home the bacon and men want attractive women because ugly women don\u2019t get laid. Which is pretty funny, because the two biggest slags in my city are both ugly as fuck yet between them have slept with nearly every male I know. I also have to mention that if Patch wasn\u2019t a hottie patottie, there is no way anyone would support all that sexual harassment to Nora. Coach laughs it off because Nora\u2019s being a hysterical woman: a man showing unwanted sexual attraction is a compliment, and nothing to get all worked up about \u2013 besides, the point of the class was to teach those strapping young lads when a girl is aroused. Stop having a woman\u2019s period and suck up the fact that a guy wants to bone you. In fact, maybe you should spend more time with him and his unwelcome sexual advances. In fact, Nora should tutor Patch! (Which, actually, is only mentioned once more in the entire novel.) I was pretty offended by this whole thing. As little as I knew about [Patch], I sensed his aversion to Vee as if it were concrete enough to touch.\u201d\nPatch has never met Vee. How can Nora know how he would feel about her best friend? Fitzpatrick is very desperately trying to show us here that Nora is the only thing Patch is interested in, even more than her \u2018sexy\u2019 non-virginal best friend.I took a moment to think over his offer. I was pretty sure that if I turned Elliot down, Vee would kill me. Besides, going out with Elliot seemed like a good way to escape my uncomfortable attraction to Patch.\nSo you want to go out with Elliot not because you like him or he\u2019s nice or you want to get to know him better, but because your best friend will kill you if you say no and you think it\u2019ll help you get over Patch? What a bitch! \u201cEvery woman needs to reinvent her sexy side\u2014I like that. My daughter got implants. She said she did it for herself, but what woman gets boobs for herself? They are a burden. She got the boobs for a man.\u201d\nPlease excuse me while I let my inner feminist rant and rage about how sexist and demeaning that is.\u201cBoys like girls who look like \u2026 girls.\u201d\nFuck you, Vee, and your anti-feminist agenda! Girls do not need to dress up to impress boys! Some boys like other boys! Some boys like girls with a bit of meat on them! Some boys like petite dark girls while others like Scandinavian Amazons! What right have YOU to say what girls should look like? My whole young adult life I was taught that the right boys will like you for you, not what you look like! What were you taught? That spreading your legs is the only way to get a guy\u2019s attention?I dug in my heels. \u201cYou want to help? Stay away from me.\u201dHe brushed a curl off my face. \u201cLove the hair. Love when it\u2019s out of control. It\u2019s like seeing a side of you that needs to come out more often.\u201d\nEvery time Nora tells him to fuck off, he comes back with a compliment on her physical appearance that\u2019s loaded with innuendo. This reinforces the rape culture of the book. Nora\u2019s saying no, but she\u2019s being reasonably polite and Patch is ignoring her rejections.\u201cYou sound worked up. Really worked up. No, that\u2019s not it. You sound agitated \u2026 flustered \u2026 aroused.\u201d I could feel her eyes widen. \u201cHe kissed you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\nWhat the fuck, Vee? First of all, it\u2019s none of your business. Second of all, kisses do not always lead to arousal. Third, it\u2019s none of your fucking business. Fourth, how the fuck do you tell if someone is aroused over the phone? Fifth, it is none of your fucking business. And sixth: how do you know when your best friend is aroused when she\u2019s never been around anyone she\u2019s found attractive before? Did you two watch porn together one time? Do you discuss what makes you horny and how your voices sound when that happens? Or are you secretly in love with Nora?Every other time I\u2019d felt that way, it was because Patch was near.The voice of reason quickly extinguished Patch\u2019s involvement.\nIf every other time you\u2019d felt that way, Patch was involved, how can you logically rule out his involvement? How does this literally work? How does your brain work, Nora? \u201cWhen I\u2019d punched myself in the face it hurt. But the voice of reason told me my face didn\u2019t hurt because I\u2019d punched it.\u201d MALARKY! Cause and effect. Causation and correlation. Fucking dumbass. How the hell are you fit for an Ivy-league school? \u201cYou\u2019re an attractive girl. I imagine there must be some interest from the opposite sex.\u201d\nThis counts as sexual harassment from yet another adult. How is this appropriate? Yes, I do know who Miss Greene turns out to be but still, if my councillor asked me this question I\u2019d put in a formal fucking complaint.Not one part of me felt comfortable with the idea of Vee spending time alone with Jules\u2026 [because he] was close friends with Elliot.\nOh Nora, you are so fucking lucky people don\u2019t judge you because of who you hang around with you shallow fucking bitch. In fact, I was pretty sure Australia had no diamonds. Period.\n BAHAHAHAHAHA! And you think you deserve an Ivy-league scholarship?Deep inside, I didn\u2019t believe Patch was the guy behind the ski mask. Maybe he had dark, disturbing secrets, but running around in a ski mask wasn\u2019t one of them.\nHow the fuck do you know? You don\u2019t know him at all! Or maybe it\u2019s just because he\u2019s so hot that he couldn\u2019t possibly attack you \u2013 except the he does! Over and over and over again! Nora, you really are fucking stupid.\u201cWe need to ask you both a few questions,\u201d he continued. He pointed for me to take a seat on my bed, but I shook my head numbly. \u201cHave you recently broken up with a boyfriend?\u201d\nFuck! Why are all the adults so interested in Nora\u2019s romantic/sex life? This is not normal. She\u2019s sixteen. Adults prefer to pretend sixteen year olds don\u2019t have sex at all.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Elliot? A murderer? He\u2019s, like, the nicest guy I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nAnd you, Vee Sky, are the most selfish, ignorant, stupid bitchiest dumbass characters I\u2019ve ever read in the history of YA.I was feeling a lot more relaxed. Patch was warm and solid, and he smelled fantastic. Like mint and rich, dark earth. Nobody had jumped out at us on the ride home... For the first time all day I felt safe.Except that Patch had cornered me in a dark tunnel and was possibly stalking me. Maybe not so safe.\nThis is an actual quote. It\u2019s like Nora\u2019 schizophrenic or something. \u201cPatch is SO hot, except he might be stalking me and I\u2019m not safe and he\u2019s SO dangerous, but that just makes him even hotter!\u201d I have never in my whole life ever known a girl to find a guy she\u2019s afraid of attractive.\u201cWhen I was in high school, I only offered rides to girls I was interested in. Let\u2019s carry that a step further. What\u2019s your relationship with your bio partner \u2026 outside the classroom?\u201d\nYet another example of all the adults\u2019 inappropriate interest in Nora\u2019s sexuality, sexual history, romantic life and sex life.I could not accept that Patch would hurt Marcie. Marcie wasn\u2019t the nicest person, and she\u2019d acquired more than a handful of enemies. A few of those enemies might be capable of brutality, but Patch wasn\u2019t one of them. Senseless beating wasn\u2019t his style.\nWHAT?! It\u2019s EXACTLY his style. He\u2019s a creepy stalker who sexually harasses and assaults you (and you LIKE it, you crazy bitch) and then you get all up on your high horse because you think he\u2019s too good to beat someone up? YOU DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW HIM.\u201cSorry, I already have plans.\u201d\u201cLet me change your mind.\u201d\nYet another one of the very numerous examples where a male assumes Nora\u2019s very definite \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018take me, I\u2019m yours\u2019.\u201cHe dragged me out the front door and shoved me against the house.\u201d\u201cBut he was drunk, right?\u201d\nLadies and gentlefolk: Vee Sky! Official worst best friend ever. Defending a guy she doesn\u2019t even know against assaulting her best friend because he\u2019s drunk. Oh, well that\u2019s okay then! Maybe if Elliot happened to be driving drunk and killed a toddler and its mother because he ran onto the pavement Vee would forgive him as well, because he has issues and was drunk!He leaned close and spoke in confidential tones. \u201cWe get a lot of folks who don\u2019t want their extracurricular activities traced, if you know what I mean.\u201d\nYet ANOTHER example of an inappropriate comment made by an adult to a minor! What planet is Fitzpatrick from?My head spun faster, and I could feel my pulse beating in my temples. I\u2019d felt this heart pounding panic before. I needed my iron pills.\nAll this malarky with the iron pills. Nora has anaemia. She has to take iron pills or she\u2019s in danger of, like, fainting\u2026 or something. Prescription iron pills. This is complete bullshit. I have anaemia. I buy my iron tablets off the shelf. If I forget to take them, I get a bit lethargic, tired, lose energy and concentration, and as a personal side effect my lips get very dry, broken and unkissable (which is why I always use lip balm). There is only danger of fainting from low iron if it\u2019s chronically low, and Nora doesn\u2019t show any other symptoms like shortness of breath, lethargy, chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, or cold skin. It\u2019s not even essential that I take my iron tablets, and I certainly don\u2019t feel the lowness of iron in my blood the way experienced diabetics can feel low blood sugar. Anaemia is not going to kill me if I forget to take a couple of tablets: it\u2019s simply inconvenient. Fitzpatrick has given Nora an inconvenient \u2018illness\u2019 in the hopes that it makes her weak in her time of greatest need. And it fails. (And now, just because I\u2019m being especially picky: iron tablets are best taken with vitamin C which helps to absorb it, not \u2018whenever I feel like the iron count in my blood is low\u2019. Which, by the way, we totally can\u2019t tell.)In the kitchen I saw my bottle of iron pills on the counter, and I immediately went for them, popping the cap and swallowing two with a glass of chocolate milk. I stood in place a moment, letting the iron work into my system, feeling my breathing deepen and slow.\nWhat the fuck? Just what the actual fuck? You can\u2019t feel the iron working its way into your blood. Just NO. That\u2019s NOT how it works. You don\u2019t feel any different at all. This is complete bullshit.Jules was dead. Elliot was almost dead. Who had killed them? Who was left? I tried to make sense of what was happening, but all reason had left me.\nNora, you never had any reason. Let\u2019s think about this. Jules is dead. Elliot is almost dead. Only Patch and Vee are still wandering the school. Logically it\u2019s gotta be one of them. Unless it was secretly you. Why can\u2019t you just admit that you think Patch is capable of this violence? Look, I know Jules is screwing with you, but really. You can\u2019t even consider for one moment that maybe Patch, the psycho stalking sexual harasser and assaulter is responsible for such violence? Cos the moment you outright accuse him and then find out he\u2019s not would be AWESOME.All the knots in my body seemed to come undone. My eyes moved out of focus. Jules\u2019s face was like an Impressionist painting\u2014blurred around the edges, lacking detail. Blood drained from my head, and I felt myself start to slip off the chair. I\u2019d felt this way enough times before to know I needed iron. Soon.\nThat has never happened to me, and I have gone weeks without taking any iron supplements. You know what? This book makes me want to punch myself in the face. Nora should be diabetic, not anaemic. One of my best mates is diabetic and when she was learning to read her own body she\u2019d do stuff like that on the way to a coma from low blood sugar. (We made her drink this special glucose syrupy thing and she was fine, BTW. We\u2019re not horrible friends who just let our best mate go into a coma before our eyes.) Iron does not magically fix the body when you think you\u2019re going to faint.\u201cI\u2019m still in there, a prisoner inside my own body, living every moment of it,\u201d he said in a grinding tone. \u201cDo you know what that feels like? Do you?\u201d he shouted.\n\nWhat the heck is up with this dialogue tag? Tacked on to the end like a bad apology. Although Fitzpatrick had generally a fine technique, I\u2019m inclined to believe that came about solely because of the multitude of edits this book would have gone through. And they missed this clumsy piece of writing. I absolutely hate it when authors write, \u201cBlah blah blah,\u201d he said. \u201cBlah blah?\u201d he shouted. It just doesn\u2019t work. For the love of god, I\u2019d prefer a bloody interrobang to an extra dialogue tag. This may be one of the only times I have an issue with Fitzpatrick\u2019s technique, but it still bothers me.

I love a good vampire story as much as the next para-junkie, but I have to say I now have a major weakness for fallen angels as well.While I can understand some people making comparisons between this book and Twilight (dark, brooding hero, and a heroine who, against her better judgment, can't keep herself from being drawn into the hero's mysterious world). But, in my own humble opinion, Hush Hush is a far superior book. Yes this book has a few faults (the bad guy is far too easy to figure out, and there are a few continuity issues that pop up), but they obviously didn't bother me that much since i basically read this book in one sitting.And finally, let me just say this...Patch is one helluva hero. He's a full-on sexy badass, and I loved him to pieces.Here's hoping November comes quickly, so i can devour the 2nd book in the series."}, {"userName": "Kogiopsis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1462364-kogiopsis", "userReview": "I have forty eight sticky notes.Well, forty nine, I suppose, since I use the little white backing thing too. They're quite nice sticky notes, designed not to be written on but as bookmarks; at some year in the past they magically appeared in my Christmas stocking, and I haven't really used them since. I suspect there were originally fifty, so I've used two elsewhere.Anyhow. Forty nine sticky notes was what I started with when I commenced reading Hush, Hush a little after 9 AM on August 25.Less than fifteen hours and over a hundred pages later, I ran out of sticky notes. I used the notes to mark particularly horrendous parts of the book- and frankly, I'm surprised they lasted this long.In the interest of not broaching another set of sticky notes which I may want from school, I'm going to deal with this book segment by segment; when I finish one round of sticky notes, I review and then continue. 'Course, since I won't post this until it's finished you'll just get the complete version. No perspective analysis, unless I really feel like it. All I'm going to do is quote Fitzpatrick, comment on the quote briefly, and move on.EDIT: Before I even got through Section 1, I was over Goodreads' character limit by 978 characters. I still have more than 9 pages (counting one side of a sheet of lined paper as a page) of handwritten notes to type up- and those aren't even including responses, they're just quotes. So I'm going to cut this review down to the maximum accepted size (and do some formatting too) and post the rest in comments. Lengthy ranting? Heck yes.Section 1: 0-113Chauncey was with a farmer's daughter on the grassy banks of the Loire River when the storm rolled in, and having let his gelding wander in the meadow, was left to his own two feet to carry him back to the chateau. - Book begins, very first sentence, with sex. BAD SIGN.-Is this going to be relevant? Do the doings of one randy duke in Sixteenth Century France really concern the later plot?Kneeling there, blinking up through the rain, he saw two thick scars on the back of the boy's naked torso. They narrowed to form an upside-down V.- Is it the scar tissue that narrows? Because that's how it seems.- I'm no expert on anatomy, but the V thing seems odd. Wouldn't having flight muscles attached to your latissimus dorsi (I believe that's the name, but the ones that wrap from the front of your ribcage to the back) be awfully strenous? Wouldn't you build up those muscles to unrealistic and bizarre-looking proportions?'Welcome to Human Reproduction (Sex)'At my side Vee Sky said, \"This is exactly why the school outlaws camera phones. Pictures of this in the e-Zine would be all the evidence I'd need to get the board of education to ax biology.\"- Is it really necessary to introduce Vee with first and last name, especially as this is written from Nora's perspective?- Odds of a BoE getting rid of biology in any school curriculum are next to nil. Odds of BoE firing idiot teacher or changing the curriculum are pretty good, though.Coach considered teaching tenth-grade biology a side assignment to his job as varsity basketball coach, and we all knew it.- The frick? No. Biology is an ENORMOUS subject. Anyone who teaches it and can get a job teaching it has to, by definition almost, be devoted primarily to it.- For future reference, Vee and Nora are sophomores, which means they'll be between fourteen and sixteen, probably sixteen. \"Science is an investigation,\" Coach said, sanding his hands together. \"Science requires us to transform into spies.\"- I will not digress into my own academic scientific background, but this is wrong. Science is an investigation, yes. Science requires observing things in a way which may be spy-like, yes. But it's not espionage. Deviate how you will from the scientific method, but most science is going to require experiments at one point, not just observation and certainly not just 'sleuthing'.Vee is my un-twin. She's green-eyed, minky blond, and a few pounds over curvy. I'm a smoky-eyed brunette with volumes of curly hair that holds its own against even the best flatirn. And I'm all legs, like a bar stool.- Descriptioninfodump not appreciated. Bits and pieces, Ms. Fitzpatz, bits and pieces. Your readers are smart enough to 'patch' together a description from fragments scattered here and there where relevant. This spoon-feeding paragraph is distracting from the 'action' of the story and just slightly insulting to my intelligence.My heart fumbled a beat and in that pause, a feeling of gloomy darkness seemed to slide like a shadow over me. It vanished in an instant, but I was still staring at him. His smile wasn't friendly. It was a smile that spelled trouble. With a promise.- Does darkness slide over something like anything but a shadow? Superflous description.- If this is her first impression of Patch, it bodes ill...Coach said, \"Human reproduction can be a sticky subject.\"\"Ewww!\" groaned a chorus of students.\"It requires mature handling. And like all science, the best approach is to learn by sleuthing. For the rest of the class, practice this technique by finding out as much as you can about your new partner.\"- Yes, it does require mature handling- which neither Fitzpatz or her character displays. Immature puns? Not amused.- SLDKJFLAJ: EXPERIMENTS GODDAMMIT. Not ****ing SLEUTHING, EXPERIMENTS.- 'Technique'? What technique? Word implies that he's taught them some kind of technique to use in 'sleuthing', but he clearly has not.- What's with Fitzpatz's love of this word 'sleuthing' anyhow? Did she just learn what it means or something? Is she trying to show off?I sat perfectly still. The ball was in his court- I'd smiled, and look how well that turned out.- We find out later that Nora wants to get into an Ivy-League school, or at least that she's capable of it. So why is someone who must have been going after her grades nigh-on aggressively her entire highschool career content to sit back passively and let someone else control the fate of an assignment? She has no drive and no persistence, obviously.Great. At this rate I would fail.- SO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YOU TWIT.\"Call me Patch. I mean it. Call me.\"- Horrible pick-up line. Does Fitzpatz really think teenagers speak like this?- Useless pick-up line. 'Call me' doesn't work unless you give the subject a relevant phone number.\"I wasn't finished,\" he said. \"I've got quite a collection going of an eZine columnist who believes there's truth in eating organic, who writes poetry in secret, and who shudders at the thought of having to choose between Stanford, Yale, and... what's that big one with the H?\"- GINORMOUS RED FLAGS. He's stalking you and taking pictures, Nora, you airhead. He's at the very least a voyeur, at the most a sexual predator. REPORT THIS SHIT. That's what the police are there for.- This is Fitzpatz trying to characterize Nora through someone else's exposition- we are told she is all of these things, but never shown any of them.The hair at the nape of my neck stood on end, and the temperature in the room seemed to chill. Ordinarily I would have gone straight to Coach's desk and requested a new seating chart.- I cannot believe it. She just basically ACKNOWLEDGED changing her viewpoint character's personality becausse of (what will become) TWOO WUVE FOEVAH AN EVAH. Under ordinary circumstances she would have requested a change, but because it's PATCH THE SUPER SPESHUL MAN she doesn't. Bullshit.He was a dark-Levi's-dark-henley-dark-boots kind of guy.- Boots? Jeans? Henley? Agh. I pictured this and it looked horrible. Ominous maybe, fashionable definitely not.\"Go for it. I could use a hook for my next eZine article. 'Tenth Grader Fights Back.' Better yet, 'Seating Chart Takes Slap in the Face.' Mmm. I like it.\"- And from this we learn that Vee can't write for jack. Seriously lame, both of these; pompous and not in the least bit clever.\"How was school?\" Dorothea asked with a slight German accent.- Poor description. This makes it sound like she's assuming the accent, not that it's natural.- Why is the housekeeper always accented? What, people born in the USA don't need to take such jobs?On the line beneath it I added, Smokes cigars. Will die of lung cancer. Hopefullly soon. Excellent physical shape.- You do realize that 'will die of lung cancer' and 'excellent physical shape' shouldn't normally go together?- Why did she scribble the last comment out? He's creepy about her; she should be creepy right back. Besides, it's the most Biology-related thing she's done yet.I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something about Patch wasn't right. Something about him wasn't normal. Something wasn't... safe.- And yet you still descend into the depths of a bar that you're too young to be in to find him. Brilliant. Stanford is drooling over that.\"As it turns out, I'm in need of a healthy female sacrifice. I'd planned on luring her into trusting me first, but if you're ready now...\"- This would make a fine joke, if it was said in a lighthearted situation, a joking tone, and to someone who wasn't already scared of Patch. As is, it just shows that he's an insensitive bastard.Patch casually but noticeably slid his sleeve down over his wrist. \"You'd prefer it someplace more private?\"- And he officially has the Magical Ability to Turn Any Situation Into Something Perverted. Just fantastic, eh?\"Intelligent. Attractive. Vulnerable.\"- PREDATOR. Singles out those who are on the outside edges, the weakest, and then takes them down. Basic predator/prey interaction. Nora is the deer with the broken leg in this one.\"I'm starting a petition to have Coach fired,\" Vee said, coming to my table.- Why the hell is everyone referring to him as Coach? Is that his given first name? Or is he just such a whackjob that he prefers it even off the field? And besides, aren't there many coaches at this school? Vee could be referring to any of them!\"Let's give the seating chart a few more weeks. Oh, and I was serious about tutoring Patch. I'll count you in.\"- WHAT. THE. FUCK. What kind of screwed-up school did you go to, Fitzpatz, that you think teachers are like this. They're NOT. Especially not to the good students, as Nora seems to be. Teachers aren't there for the money, they're there because teaching is what they want to do. No teacher will condone, facilitate, or even allow the abuse Patch dishes out to Nora, and no teacher would not only refuse to make a simple change to ease a studen's mind but also lassoo said student into tutoring someone she is afraid of.Vee unlocked the doors to her 1995 purple Dodge Neon.- What is it with Fitzpatz and the year, model, and make of these beat-up old cars? At the very least drop the year; NO ONE CARES. Hate to stereotype but your book will be read primarily by hormonal teenage girls. You don't need to appeal to the inner car mechanic in most of them, trust me.I had never been seriously interested in anyone. How wierd was I? \"It isn't about the boys, it's about... love. I haven't found it.\"- WHAT THE FUCK. AGAIN. NOT HAVING INTENSE CRUSHES DOESN'T MAKE YOU A FREAKSHOW. GOD. (and I don't use that lightly, as an atheist.) Seriously, talk to a couple of teenagers. I personally am DAMN FUCKING PROUD to have made it to sixteen years old without a first kiss. No, I'm not shitting you. Sometimes high school boys are just stupid and not worth your time; there's no shame in that. Hell, I can name someone who shares my 'romantic state' and is two years older than I am. Assuming that all teenagers are horny little idiots and that high school 'romance' is the center of their universe makes no one look worse than the IDIOT AUTHOR.- Now, keeping in mind that I have little romantic experience, point two. Saving yourself for your One Twoo Wuv is all well and good in fairy tales, but in real life is impractical. Like anything you pin all your hopes on, the potential for disaster is enormous. You know the saying 'the bigger they are, the harder they fall'? Applies double to expectations. Build yourself up and it'll just be worse if/when it goes wrong. And let's face it, Nora's idiot enough that it's GONNA GO WRONG.\"Someday this is going to be us. Ravished by half-dressed cowboys. I wonder what it's like to kiss a pair of sunbaked, mud-crusted lips?\"- MEMO TO VEE AND ALL ROMANCE WRITERS: 'Ravished' does not mean wild, passionate, consensual, kinky sex on a rug. It. MEANS. RAPE. I don't need to go on and on about how Rape Is Wrong. I think review readers understand that. I wish authors did. This word makes me so incredibly angry I can't even- I just can't.My sixth sense graduated to high alert.- I swear, 'alert' should be replaced by 'school'. At least then it would be funny. As it is, SENTENCEFAIL.At first I couldn't distinguish any facial features, and then I realized he was wearing a ski mask.- First off, one word: CLICHE. (This is the Review Of Much Caps.)- 'At first' she couldn't distinguish facial features... and then she realized she couldn't distinguish facial features due to the ski mask. Okay, so why the 'at first'?I watched with horror as the door began to bow. He was tearing- it- off.- How much will you bet me this turns out to be Patch?- Dramatic- dashes- do- not- achieve- effect.Lifting my eyes just high enough to get a look at him without appearing that I was, I took in his fine-boned, handsome face. Blond hair hung at his shoulders. Eyes the color of chrome. Unshaven. Impeccably dressed in a tailored jacket over his green sweater and dark designer jeans.- Tried to picture outfit; failed. Asked friend Fashion Maven to picture outfit; she rejected it. Conclude that 'Impeccably' doesn't mean what Fitzpatz thinks it means.- Brought this scene up to other friend and she made good point. Why are they having breakfast at a bistro on a school morning? I could understand Vee doing this, as she doesn't give a crap for her grades, but Nora's suppsed to be Ivy-League caliber. Also, Wikipedia will tell you that bistros are defined by their food- namely things which are cooked SLOWLY. Like, say, exactly the kind of thing you really don't want to be eating when you have to be in class on time? Yeah, precisely like that.\"Mmm, check it out,\" said Vee. \"Mr. Green Sweater is getting out of his seat. Now that's a body that hits the gym regularly. He is definitely making his way toward us, his eyes pursuing the real estate, your real estate, that is.\"- Run-on sentence; the last comma should be a period.- Editorfail: Pursuing? Or did you mean 'perusing'? Though I wouldn't put it past any of these characters to get the two mixed up... if they know the word 'perusing' in the first place...- I have officially joined the Veehaters.When he didn't answer, I turned sideways. \"Soap. Shampoo. Hot water.\"\"Naked. I know the drill.\"- How does this supposed supernatural creature have the exact same Awkwardness Summon abilities as a regular hormonal human teenage boy? - SQUICK PATCH. SQUICK.\"Nora.\" The warning in Coach's voice pulled me back to my quiz, but I couldn't help speculating about what Patch's answer might have been, and it had me wanting to slide far away from him.- This would have been an excellent point for Fitzpatz to show us that Nora is smart and a good student, the kind of person who would have to choose between Ivies for college. Instead, she leaves us with the telling of this we got earlier and shows us Nora as a hormonal idiot who is distracted by a guy she finds creepy. Sorry if I don't believe the characterization I was told and instead go with what I was shown.My voice caught on the word, and I wondered if after today I would ever feel like calling Vee my friend again.- Pity this didn't occur to Nora earlier.- And yet this comment doesn't come into play later. Where's the ongoing doubt in Vee's trustworthiness or the value of her friendship? At the Delphic Amusement Park, for instance?I was all alone, free do to as I pleased.I came to a stop at the third door on the left. I sucked in a breath and knocked, but it was obvious from the darkened window that the room was empty. I pushed on the door.- This may seem a minor nitpick, but SENTENCE VARIATION, DAMMIT. Four sentences in a row that start with 'I (past tense verb)' are amateur. Seriously, I used to pull this formulaic shit to get out of required writing assignments when I was in elementary school. Any close-reading editor should have caught this and made Fitzpatz rewrite this little section so that it was smoother and, oh, MATURE.He jerked his chin out the door. \"I need you to exit the building immediately.\"- Mental image: chin flies out the door. Hilarious, but stupid.- I dunno about Fitzpatz, but I've actually been at school during a bomb threat. And you know what they do? THEY MAKE YOU STAY PUT. You don't leave the building or even the room, especially if you're in someplace where a student shouldn't be. This reaction is ridiculous.\"All the seats here are taken,\" I said. When he didn't answer, I grabbed my glass back and took a sip of water, accidentally swallowing an ice cube. It burned the whole way down. \"Shouldn't you be working instead of fraternizing with customers?\"- Where's the choking 'Gaaaack, gaaack' that is normal aftermath of swallowing an ice cube? Maybe it's a nitpick, but if you're going to make your main character do something like that, use all aspects of it- wouldn't it be interesting to have her embarass herself this way in front of Patch?Even though it would probably come back to haunt me, I was curious enough about Patch to go almost anywhere with him.\"I want to get you alone,\" Patch said.- Do I even have to make the comment here? Good. Because I can't compose myself enough to get past the DLSKJF; STUPID CHARACTER rant stage. So it's nice that this one speaks for itself.He was dressed in knee-length basketball shorts and a white Nike sweatshirt.- What kind of imbecile wears a sweatshirt to PE, when you know you'll be sweating buckets and giving off heat like nobody's business?\"Run!\" my team shouted from the dugout. \"Run, Nora!\"I ran.\"Drop the bat!\" they screamed.I flung it aside.\"Stay on first base!\"I didn't.- The hell? Someone who doesn't do well in sports and doesn't like them much isn't going to go for the gusto. You take first base and you stick with it, because it's better than getting struck out. So either Nora has no strategic/logical brain at all (possible) or Patch being there completely screwed it up. (possible).- Choppy writing supposed to be dramatic? Because it's not.\"Trust me, Dorth, there are no boys in my life.\" Okay, maybe there were two lurking on the fringe, circling from afar, but since I didn't know either very well, and one outright frightened me, it felt safer to close my eyes and pretend they weren't there.- Patch OUTRIGHT FRIGHTENS HER. Feh. Warning sign much, you airhead?- The imagery here makes both boys sound like sharks. Eeew. Not a healthy image if you expect her to fall in love with one of them.Dorothea had moved down the hall to the powder room.- No teenager in their right minds would seriously use the words 'powder room' in place of 'bathroom'.

All of these \"he wants to kill me and scares me but also protects me so SWOON\" books are getting out of control. Please say it with me: a guy who is tempted to kill you IS NOT ATTRACTIVE.Like he's not special for being able to kill you... your elderly neighbor could do the same. You can technically drown in a teaspoon of water, but you aren't grateful every time you drink water and it helps you instead. Not killing you should be the expected norm.This is like some bad Twilight spinoff with an even more pathetic main character who just doesn't know what she wants. She flips back and forth between thinking Patch is a stalker who wants to kill her, but also being super drawn to him and thinking he could never hurt her... because she just looks at him and knows. (?!!!) She brushes aside all evidence that would draw the attention of any sane person and constantly writes herself off. But then she's willing to jump to some pretty crazy conclusions and act on those, so I don't even know what to do with this character. I would say half of her behavior is entirely out of character if I could get a grasp on what that even is.Most of the story was just ridiculous. Like she goes to the biology teacher to request a new seating arrangement because Patch and his creepy comments/innuendo make her feel uncomfortable, so the teacher tells her to tutor him instead. And I'm sorry, but no high school biology class is going to teach kids about sex by assigning them the homework of \"sleuthing\", hitting on each other & watching body language, and talking about what they look for in a potential mate.The writing wasn't the absolute worst thing I've ever read, so there's that.

I guess I can say I've done that now ... *tosses book in the trash*I was recommended this book by one of my best friends who, before now, I thought had great taste in books. I am now questioning our friendship (kidding, kidding).I really thought I was going to love this book. It had so many ingredients that I like. Hot boys, Dark hero, romance, danger. Turns out it also had about a bazillion of the ingredients I don't like. Predictability, instalove, abusive and controlling behavior being glorified. And to top it off, this book hit the clich\u00e9 nail on the head!No thanks. Not for me.The Story\"A SACRED OATHA FALLEN ANGELA FORBIDDEN LOVE\"Sounds awesome right?Patch is an overprotective (bordering on abusive) fallen angel. Nora is a typical high school student. Aaaaaand we all know where this is going don't we?What I Did Not LikeLet's have a little talk about controlling and abusive behavior for a second. It's not cute/hot/attractive!!! Our \"hero\" tends to be a bit on the stalker-y/overprotective/abusive side of things and I do not feel like the issues with this behavior were ever really addressed. I just don't see a relationship starting out like this to be a lasting formula. I strongly feel like it is very dangerous for books like this to glorify and romanticize this type of behavior/situation.The target demographic for this book is young teenagers who are just starting to explore the idea of romantic love and sex. I really didn't have anyone to teach me what a healthy relationship was and how to spot dangerous red flags in my relationships. because of this, I ended up falling for the quintessential \"bad boy\" and it did not go well. Unfortunately, a lot of people in this target demographic live with similar situations. This controlling, stalker-y trope needs to be addressed. I repeat ... IT IS NOT OK! Instalove by the truckloads which is legit my second least favorite trope of all time. Insta-lust I get. It happens. But to take this normal human reaction and portray it as true, deep, lasting romance is absurd and I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT! *Drops mic**Picks mic back up because I forgot I wasn't finished*Predictability... so much predictability. I'm sure that after my short synopsis above you could accurately guess the entire plot of this story.And as if that was not enough .... let's throw a good old fashion love triangle in there with yet more overprotective stalker-y/abusive behavior. Sounds goooooood to me... NOT!In ConclusionI think maybe you can tell that I was not a fan? Yeah... I think that was obvious.There was just nothing about this story that made it special or unique to me. I think perhaps I may have enjoyed this when I was younger, but hey, I was dumb and glorifying overprotective abusive relationships of my own at the time.New refined me says NO to this book and I will not be continuing with this series."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2379463-kate", "userReview": "Oh My God OMG OMG OMG! Just finished Hush Hush one minute ago. I freaking LOVE this book!!!!!!! Fave book of the year!Edit: Here's a more err professional review.After reading the first two chapters on the Simon & Schuster website, I knew I would love this book. And sure enough, I did. It's not like this topic hasn't been done before, forbidden romance. However Becca has written a novel with the same idea but the writing is exceptional. Reading Hush Hush was like riding a roller coaster, the story moves in a fast pace and before you know it, it's over. I long to go back into Patch's and Nora's world and experience everything again. Nora is an excellent protagonist. Like Patch describes her, she's attractive, intelligent and vulnerable. Her emotions are perfectly captured and portrayed. Patch is a very intriguing guy and more so when he is reluctant to talk about his past. Though he can be provocative --and flirtatious at times, he is very attractive and has this 'good' side of him. Despite Nora feeling uncomfortable with Patch, she is drawn to him. Her best friend, Vee, is affable but don't insult her because she can be rather sharp-tongued! There is one part towards the end when everything seemed so surreal (hint: that part reminded me of Cassandra Clare's City of Bones), I wanted Nora to run and hug Patch. I wanted to cry during that part, honestly. I can feel Nora's pain and when she questions her sanity, I got quite a bit emotional at that point. I hereby declare Patch from Hush Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick my favourite YA guy. Trust me, by the time you are done with Hush Hush, you'll be like Edward who?

This is my story:*************************Leaving my house around 6:25pm, I headed out the door and I thought, just my luck on one of the most important days of my life, it\u2019s raining cats and dogs.I hopped into my car and raced to my appointment in hopes of not being late. I finally arrived at the building with 3 minutes to spare. I jumped out my car without grabbing an umbrella and jogged to the entrance. As I\u2019m walking down the hall, I see my reflection in the mirror. \u201cGod I look horrid! \u201c You know that look \u2013 like you\u2019ve been dumped over the head with a bucket of water. \u201cOh, well there\u2019s nothing I can do about that now.\u201dFinally this is it. I\u2019m standing at the entrance of the door that could be my possible salvation. I take a deep breath and try to control my nerves as much as possible. \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d I knock on the door.Dr. Chen opens the door. \u201cHi Tina, it\u2019s so nice to see you again. Come in, what can I do for you today?\u201dI make my way over to the couch across from Dr. Chen\u2019s desk and take a seat. At this point everything imaginable is going through my head.\u201cUh-hum\u201d Dr. Chen clears his throat rescuing me from my jumbled thoughts.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to disturb you at such a late hour, but I needed someone to talk to.\u201d\u201cNo worries, my door is always open for you, now what seems to be the matter?\u201dI shake my head \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d\u201cNow, now my dear, It will be alright.\" He coos. \"Just start from the beginning.\u201dHis voice is soothing. \u201cIt all started with this book I read.\u201dDr. Chen arches a brow. \u201cA book you say?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s called Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick.\u201dDr. Chen nods. \u201cOk, go on.\u201dI couldn\u2019t take this, so I blurted. \u201cI think I\u2019m obsessed Dr. Chen!\u201d There. It\u2019s out. I\u2019ve said it.Dr. Chen looks confused. \u201cWhat makes you think that dear?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s this character in the book named Patch and he\u2019s all I ever think about. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me!\u201dHe squints and eyes me curiously. \u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s all you think about?\u201dOh My God. I bet he thinks I\u2019m crazy! And as if he could read my mind, he says.\u201cTina, whatever you tell me stays between us, Patient \u2013 Doctor Confidentiality.\u201d This is reassuring, so I go on.\u201cDr. Chen, I seem to be obsessed with a fictional character! Is that normal?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d He nods. \u201cI see, well let me just grab my journal and see if we can put your mind at ease.\u201dHe walks over to his bookshelf and grabs a journal and flips to a page.\u201cYes, Yes here it is.\u201d He slides the journal over to me and points at a photo on the page. I\u2019m taken back by the photo staring up at me. It\u2019s a photo of Edward Cullen, but that\u2019s not what catches my attention, it\u2019s the photo next to it of a dark haired, dark eyed Angel that seem to see right into your soul. Patch Cipriano.I look up at Dr. Chen accusingly. \u201cWhat is this? Why do you have pictures of fictional characters? Is this some kind of joke?\u201dHe shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not Tina. What you see here is a typical case of Hush, Hush fanaticism.\u201d\u201cWhat? What exactly does that mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rather simple really, Tina what you are experiencing is quite normal.\u201d\u201cNormal? How is this obsession normal?\u201d\u201cLet me put your mind at ease dear, you are not the only one who\u2019s experienced this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d I can\u2019t believe it. I breathe a sigh of relief, then point to the picture of Patch. \u201cHow do I fix th-th-this? Whatever this is?\u201dDr. Chen smirks. \u201cQuite easily actually, all you have to do is reread the book until he\u2019s out of your system.\u201d\u201cHuh? Is that possible?\u201d\u201cOf Course!\u201d He points to the photo of Patch. \u201cNow, why don\u2019t you tell me how you came to be obsessed with this character Patch?\u201d\u201cDo you think it will help?\u201d\u201cI most certainly do!\u201dI take a deep breath and tell him my story.*************************If I didn\u2019t know anything about this book, I don\u2019t think I would ever have thought that Hush, Hush was Fitzpatrick\u2019s debut novel. The writing is brilliant! Becca took me on a journey and I was thoroughly entertained. I was caught up in the world wind of Nora & Patch at the first page, this book is addictive and I could not put it down for one minute. I broke all my review rules to read this book and that\u2019s saying a lot!Fitzpatrick did a fantastic job with the characters in Hush, Hush. I laughed throughout this book at Nora and Vee\u2019s conversations and strange dealings. These characters are so relatable paranormal aside. This is one of the reasons I love this book, these characters are downright fun and entertaining.What can I say about Patch? Tall, Dark & Dangerously Sexy! I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so alluring, maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s a Bad Boy. Whatever it is, Becca did an incredible job portraying him and I can finally confess that Patch is my new fictional crush! I found myself smiling throughout this whole book.I love when a book can keep me guessing. This book kept me turning the pages for so many reasons. I had to know what would happen next, whether it was for sizzling scenes with Patch & Nora or downright hilarious moments with Nora & Vee or even the strange things happening around Nora. I absolutely, positively devoured every page! Well as you can see, I\u2019m Hush, Hush\u2019s #1 fan!I love everything about this book. I will definitely follow the doctor\u2019s order and reread this book until I can get Patch out of my system, which may be never.

I love when I have such strong emotions toward characters, it's a compliment to the authors ability to make such a three dimensional character, and Fitzpatrick is right on!The plot was insane, twist upon twist, up until the final pages.

The reason I was wary was because Hush, Hush is very comparable to Stephenie Meyer\u2019s Twilight series. Now if an author can ride on Meyer\u2019s coattails and have an original idea and really make it shine, I\u2019m all for that. But in the case of Hush, Hush I\u2019m afraid to say that Becca has not only ridden on Meyer\u2019s coattails, but hopped on her back and took every single thing from Twilight and placed it in Hush, Hush. The comparisons between Twilight and Hush, Hush are too strong not to ignore and honestly, Hush, Hush reads like a Twilight fan fiction where Becca decided to change the characters and a bit of the plot that fails in so many ways. If you\u2019re going to take someone else\u2019s idea and try to build on it, at least be smart about it.Nora Grey and her best friend Vee Sky, who Nora calls her \u201cun-twin\u201d enjoy working for their school\u2019s eZine in Coldwater, a town in Maine where the fog is very thick. Nora lives on the outskirts of town in an eighteenth century farmhouse with her mother who works for an auction company that requires a great deal of traveling. Nora\u2019s father is no longer around because he was shot to death. But Nora is seeing a therapist to come to terms about her father\u2019s death. She feels as if her father is watching her from above because she has always felt a presence watching over her from a distance.Nora is in for a surprise when she goes to her Biology class and her teacher decides to change the seating chart. Nora\u2019s new Bio partner is the new transfer who goes by the name of Patch. The new guy is dark very much in the literal sense from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. He has \u201ccool black eyes\u201d and when his eyes slice into Nora, she feels a \u201cgloomy darkness like a shadow\u201d over her. Patch also has an interesting scent to him, of \u201csomething richer, fouler\u201d, much like cigars. Nora and Patch\u2019s introduction doesn\u2019t go that well because he is very rude, crude and speaks in sexual innuendos. His disrespect towards Nora makes her very uncomfortable.You would think a guy like Patch, who is very much a verbal bully would make Nora offended. But there is something about Patch that speaks to her as in, this guy is a jerk and seems dangerous, but he looks good in black, so I\u2019m going to find out whatever I can about him. Because Vee is also very noisy, she and Nora team up to find about Patch\u2019s deep dark secrets.Around the same time Nora begins her investigation; strange things start to happen. She runs over a guy in a ski mask with her car who then attacks her by bashing in her window. She begins seeing this phantom ski mask person everywhere after. Also, two new boys have entered on the scene. Jules and Elliott meet Nora and Vee at a bistro. Elliott has transferred from Kinghorn Prep to Coldwater High. Vee is over the moon at having fresh blood\u2026 two new cute boys to hang out with. Jules, who still attends Kinghorn, is moody and rude while Elliott, who at first seems pretty nice, becomes very aggressive and mean for no reason. Nora realizes something is up with Elliott and Jules, just because they are so moody and mean! And because Nora is such a great sleuth, she goes to the library and Google\u2019s Elliott\u2019s name where she finds out he may or may have not murdered a girl at Kinghorn.As all this is going on, Patch seems to pop up wherever Nora is. He taunts her, much like a rebel on his motorcycle (which he has) and dares her to come walk on the wild side with him. They go on a scary ride at the boardwalk, he comes to her house and makes her dinner but holds a knife in such a way that Nora thinks he may stab her at one point with it. Whenever she is in dark scary places, Patch is there with his cold black eyes. And Nora thinks she is going crazy because she swears she can hear Patch talking in her head.And again the sleuth that Nora is, where she has channeled Nancy Drew, goes to the library and begins to research fallen angels because of some strange V like scars on Patch\u2019s back that are \u201cangel wing scars\u201d. Nora now knows that Patch is not human. And things become worse because someone is out to hurt Nora. Vee is caught in the middle, and Jules and Elliott are also be involved. Nora has no choice but to turn to Patch. And what she sees through his eyes, by touching his no touch zone on his back, will shock her to the very core!Hush, Hush should have a lot to recommend about it. I will begin to say that Becca\u2019s writing is commendable, but the way she has set things are so disjointed and stilted. I did like Nora in the beginning but then she ventured into the too stupid to live zone. The way she and Vee acted in regards to Patch was too immature and eye rolling. Why would you be so interested in Patch who comes across as a verbally abusive individual who makes you frightened for your life? Nora is never really attracted to Patch because the majority of the time she lives in fear of him. At one point she is in the library underground parking garage and plays catch me if you can around a car with Patch because she doesn\u2019t want him to come near her. She thinks he is possibly the crazy ski mask man, the one who beat up a girl who was mean to her and every time she is with him, she has a sense of impending doom. At no point do we see Nora giving any real reason why she would be so interested in Patch. There is nothing redeemable about him in the least. Want to hear a big clich\u00e9? Nora is on a bus and gets off a stop where the bus driver says it\u2019s not safe. Nora shrugs it off and actually walks down a dark, dank alley! Good grief.As for Patch he is a manipulative jerk. I can\u2019t help but bring up the comparison with him and Edward.***This is a spoiler, so beware!**I\u2019ve read the countless discussions in regards to Meyer\u2019s Edward, where he is a stalker and a murderer. The thing with Edward and his desire with Bella is that his need to kill her is more instinct and a deep hunger because Bella is his food, if you think about it. Edward grapples with this nature and overcomes his need. With Patch, his need to kill Nora is not because of an elemental need or hunger, but simply a means to an end, a reward he will receive. Patch has a way to reach his ultimate goal if he gets rid of Nora. There is no reason for him to hold back and not kill her that I can think of because there is nothing wonderful to recommend about Nora.Hush, Hush is a rehash of Twilight plain and simple. Examples such as:- Nora and Patch being partners in Bio class.- Patch being dark, mysterious and dangerous, yet Nora can\u2019t stay way.- Nora lists attributes in regards to Patch much like Bella did with Edward, where she comes to these conclusions what Patch is.- Nora is placed time and again in danger because of her own stupidity and her interactions and constant obsessing over Patch.Need I go on?Becca Fitzpatrick has written the complete opposite of what a healthy teenage romance should be. Patch is the perfect example of what an abusive near psycho boyfriend would be and Nora the weak, lost girl who thinks she is strong but isn\u2019t. If I had to recommend a book to a young girl looking for a bad boy who is redeemed by love, Hush, Hush would never be mentioned.I wish there was one positive thing I could say about Hush, Hush. I simply can\u2019t. From the unbelievable actions of Nora and Vee to the near villain like tendencies of Patch, to the too many comparisons to count to Meyer\u2019s Twilight, Hush, Hush belongs more as the musing of a fan fiction writer than a published novel that has no place in being read by impressionable young teens or the older audience who should know better to enjoy something like this."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "*Important update, 8/13/2011: I read this book a year and a half ago and gave it five stars. Like Evermore, I don't feel like rereading the book to assign it a rating more akin to my current tastes. If I did I would probably give it three or four stars. You can read my review from a long time ago below, though I would recommend reading other more cultivated reviews...Nora Gray is the typical over-achieving high school girl in the sense that she aims to go Yale, has a best friend, and has a somewhat dysfunctional family. Even her name seems synonymous with plain and simple. However, the reasons that Nora isn't the typical high school girl are many: she is independent, even at her age, because her mom travels a lot after her dad passed away. Her best friend Vee is obsessed with all the things Nora chooses to ignore - boys, shopping, and drama. And Nora is about to experience her first taste of real danger in the delectable Patch Cipriano, the sexy, mysterious boy she finds herself sitting next to in biology class one morning. Patch radiates tall, dark, and handsome, and the following day Nora realizes that she seems to be seeing him... everywhere.Hush, Hush deserved a much better synopsis than that. However, it's difficult to entail all the things in the plot that make the book magnificent without spoilers appearing. So that will have to do. Even though the multiple summaries of the book and maybe even the book jacket allude to this book being the typical \"girl meets dangerous boy\" type or ordeal, it isn't. It really isn't.I have to gush about Patch. Once again I don't want to give anything a way so my description might be vague but he's the type that would make any teenage girl or maybe even questioning boy swoon and blush along with Nora. He was the epitome of sexy and mysterious without overdoing it, he never became too much like other guys in other YA fiction, he was always dark and throughout the book questionable in a mysteriously appealing way. Patch Cipriano is just... wow. Definitely in my top 10 male characters of all time.Also, I really enjoyed Nora and Vee's friendship. Everything they did together, whether is was arguing about boys or skipping out on their diets together was just so real, and never forced. As a teenager I could easily distinguish between an author trying to hard to create a friendship, and an author who really hits the nail on the head. Fitzpatrick did just that - I always looked forward to and enjoyed their shared dialogue. Actually, all the characters in this book were great and more than just one-dimensional archetypes. Even the antagonist, who is sure to surprise readers by the end of the novel.The plot... wow, it was amazing. The story hooked me in and never let me go. I've said this about other novels but Hush, Hush was absolutely terrific. Even the most simple scenes were described with an underlying sense of terror and intrigue, the whole book flowed together smoothly and there were never dull moments or overstated moments.So taking all things into consideration I would recommend this book to... everyone. I think it's important to get the point across that this book isn't a typical girl meets boy love story with a dark edge, it's much more than that. It has all the elements that make reading a book worthwhile - fascinating descriptions of scenery, terrific writing, intriguing characters, and an addicting plot that includes a modern civilization intertwined with a supernatural world."}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5645967-laurel", "userReview": "1.5 StarsThe half is there for the sole reason that Hush, Hush did not irk me as much as Halo did. I\u2019m a little confused by that but whatevs.Wow.Just wow. No, this is not a good wow.This is a \u201cHoly shit, you really did that didn\u2019t you? I can\u2019t fucking believe that\u201d kind of wow.A wow that just destroys my very soul and forces me to wonder WHY someone could possibly like a book such as this. But don\u2019t worry, I have an explanation as to why someone could enjoy these honey bunches of pages because I too was feeling the tug that Fitzpatrick was trying to put on me. More on that later in the review.But let\u2019s get started with my first statement on this subject matter. This is my first taste into the world of YA\u2019s terrifying epidemic. The tragic disease known as \u201crape culture\u201d, the new culture of Young Adult books focusing on physical abuse and awkward closeness and \u201cNo means Yes\u201d as A-okay for a healthy, sparkly, loving relationship! Because it\u2019s so real and relatable or something.Honestly, is anyone that much of a masochist, to allow themselves to get beat up and say, \u201cOhh yeah baby you got it\u201d? What deranged demon possessed these authors to create such beastly, horrid books that encourage this utter nonsense? I\u2019ll tell you what demon: Raphy the Rape Devil (the \u201ch\u201d is silent). Raphy goes and poisons the mind of these PNR authors that were apparently all there when they wrote these damn books. I call shenanigans on that, by the by.Oh right, I have to talk about the book.Hush, Hush is a book with a title that sounds interesting but has no meaning to whatever story was in this book. Actually, if I think of it by Raphy and the Rape Culture View, Hush, Hush is what Patch always to shut up Nora so he could abuse her. That\u2019s my thought anyway. Normally I\u2019d feel bad for someone in Nora\u2019s position, but 10 times out of 9, she just takes it and gets turned on and shit. It\u2019s disgusting.But let\u2019s get to the breakdown we\u2019re all waiting for, yes?There were too many times that the style Fitzpatrick used bothered me. The upside was that we were definitely in Nora\u2019s head, but it was SO MUCH SO that I wanted out of Nora\u2019s head. I must also say that even though the characters themselves were horrible stupid people, I could still tell who said what in quotes. The characters had voices of their own, as similar as they were.But lemme get to what I mentioned earlier about how people could enjoy this. I\u2019m a fan of shoujo manga, like the stupid nonsensical, \u201cthe hell is even happening?\u201d shoujo manga. It\u2019s this kind of nonsense that Hush, Hush must have based itself off of. If I had first seen this is a manga format, and I kid you not, I might have enjoyed it. Because it\u2019s dumb and isn\u2019t supposed to make sense, and pictures!Instead, Becca Fitzpatrick was honestly trying for a serious story with serious bad boy tones and stalkers! Patch is supposed to be our bad boy love interest. A tortured soul or whatever. And she pulls it off with phrases like:\"Call me Patch. I mean it. Call me.\"\"Soap. Shampoo. Hot water.\u201d\u201cNaked. I know the drill.\u201dThis isn\u2019t remotely cute or endearing!! Becca, do you hear me? WHAT IS CUTE AND ENTICING ABOUT THIS DUMB KID? Even if he\u2019s a bad boy, we should find something that draws us to him. But no, we just watch Nora draw him in like, \u201cOhmigawd he so bad and yet so good! ME WANT, ME WANT.\u201d And yet we don\u2019t even know why the fuck she wants him and his ass.But yes, this is why I was feeling Fitzpatz\u2019s tug on getting me to like this book. I saw it as a stupid shoujo and I was actually enjoying myself for a time. As fucked up and strange as that is...it\u2019s how I saw it. Also the wonderful advice from Karen (I think? I\u2019m sure it was Karen), to treat Hush, Hush as a big fat joke really helped me out through this. I\u2019m not as enraged as I was when I finished Halo.She also said fairly stupid things like:\u201cI affected a yawn.\u201d--How does one affect a yawn?\u201cBecause other angels were good. Patch was not.\u201d-- YOU FIGURED IT OUT!!\u2028It was so STUPID for a girl who was supposedly Harvard-smart to think like this. Lololol this was such a dumb book.Oh right there were characters in here, weren\u2019t there?Let\u2019s tear them up.Nora \u201cI\u2019M DRAWN TO UNREAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE OPPOSITE SEX\u201d GreyThis girl is dumb. Really dumb. HOWEVER, she is smarter than Bethany Church. She is smarter than a rock (even if it\u2019s just a little bit). She does take initiative when she\u2019s trying to keep from Patch. But of course, that has to be short lived because c\u2019mon, when is a book about something other than romance interesting? Nora has to fall in lust with Patch and hunt down his past! That is the only way Young Adult works derrr.Oh what\u2019s that? You want to know how Nora tries to figure out Patch\u2019s past before molesting his scar?WELL, instead of the rational thing and just sitting him down and chatting, Nora makes this big deal about going to his private file (you know, private records that are private for a REASON?), and digging more about him.Actual quote on the matter: \u201cSo what if there was private information inside? As Patch's biology partner, I had a right to know these things.\u201dNo one has a right to anyone\u2019s files but their own. It\u2019s common sense, common courtesy, and Im sure she\u2019d get kicked out of school or suspended or something if caught. So to avoid getting caught, Tweedle Nora and Tweedle Vee CALL IN A BOMB THREAT. Because that\u2019ll get everyone out of the school and get the whole police force IN the school and completely defeat the purpose.Also, I want to elaborate on a particular point in this book where Nora gets his record and finds nothing on immunization and finds it wrong. I am not immunized. I had to sign legal papers to be accepted into a New York college, etc etc, it\u2019s a difficult process.Moving on to why this moment really pissed me off. Nora thought it \u201cwasn\u2019t right\u201d for Patch to have no immunization record. This is as if Fitzpatrick is relaying her beliefs on me that \u201canyone is weird and not right if they\u2019ve never been immunized\u201d. Doing that on top of rape culture? Fuck you to hell. I don\u2019t have an immunization record, but you don\u2019t see me losing it, or being \u2018not quite there\u2019. I get legitimately sick a total of 2-3 days a year. I\u2019m a healthy kid.Nora really isn\u2019t a person, or a cutout of an archetype. She\u2019s a puppy to Patch\u2019s will, and that in itself simply infuriated me. But like this immunization biz, Nora just can\u2019t wrap her head around simple concepts. Like there are indeed people in this world without a Facebook, blog, or Myspace, and they still exist. You don\u2019t need access to a social site to exist, just a beating heart.She also finds it A-okay to talk about her dead father. Now that\u2019s one thing. I\u2019m more than glad that Nora is not trying to hide him like Vanessa Sands did with her sister in goddamn Siren. But when she does talk about him, she talks about how he was murdered like it\u2019s casual conversation. She isn\u2019t even FAZED by it. What? I still choke up when I talk about my dead dog! I\u2019m so confused.Enough about that Nora chick. I don\u2019t like her.PATCH \u201cIMMA BAD BOY\u201d CIPRIANO OR WHATEVERThis is a boy that makes girls squeal apparently by saying things such as:\u201cI wanna do a lot of things to your body.\u201d\u201cWell I\u2019m in need of a healthy female sacrifice. I\u2019d planned on luring her into trusting me first...\u201d\u201cI like vulnerable woman.\u201d\u201cI did plan on killing you.\u201dEVERYONE\u2019S NORMAL REACTIONS WOULD BE THISBut Patch will always be there to getcha. Alllllllwaaaaayssssssss....*shudder*Patch is a rapist. He is abusive, strange, and an asshole. A HUGE asshole, even more asshole than the lovable assholes of every shoujo manga I ever read. He wears a baseball cap and tends to get shirtless and has an awkward lambda-like scar on his back. Patch is a bad dude. Not the lovable bad boy, but the \u201cYOU SHOULD BE RUNNING\u201d bad boy.Not once did I find Patch reassuring, kind, helpful, respectful, funny, or interesting. It was a steaming pile of shit and rape. All he wants is Nora\u2019s legs, preferably open me thinks. God I just can\u2019t express my hatred for Patch. I\u2019m too tired to think about it.Vee was a dumb friend, somehow feeling happy and go-lucky while on PAINKILLERS (they don\u2019t work that way). She was helpless and stupid. I\u2019m surprised that even Nora had a brain cell or two more than her.Why was Elliot so evil? Why was he just killed and what not? Are we ever diving into Papa Grey\u2019s murder orrr...?I\u2019m sick of these characters, let\u2019s move on.DAT STRUCTUREWhat structure? Oh the usually Twilight structure of LOVE LOVE LOVE then last 15% of book can be plot I guess. Nora was Bella, Patch was a worse version of Eddiekins, and the whole clusterfuck called Hush, Hush was just an introduction into the world of rape culture.The littler tykes gotta know this: ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BAD. There is nothing healthy or life-changing about an abusive boyfriend and \u201cHe hurts me cuz he loves me\u201d. It\u2019s sick, degrading, and horrifying. There is NOTHING RIGHT ABOUT IT SO STOP PRAISING IT AS RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME, FITZPATZ AND SMALLER TEENAGE GIRLS OF THE WORLD.This is glorifying abuse. This is glorifying terrible things that are frowned upon in today\u2019s society. What is this book.Moving on, there was no structure in this book, but I didn\u2019t need to tell you all that since I\u2019m a little late to the Snark Party. Nothing was happening in a decent order. Jules/Chauncey was a stupid villain because he wasn\u2019t even around enough to be considered as such in my eyes. Fitzpatz cleverly avoided characterization.Overall, why are you picking this up and trying to enjoy it? If you MUST enjoy it, enjoy it as a stupid shoujo manga. You might get some entertainment out of it. Other than that, this book is just fucking horrible. TERRIBLE. You don\u2019t care about anyone in here. Nothing life-changing happens, and nothing is even remotely exciting.Too many times did I sit and go, \u201cNora\u2019s gone get raped isn\u2019t she? WHY ISN\u2019T SHE RUNNING. WHY IS SHE SO DEAD PAN I DON\u2019T GET IT.\u201d I was utterly appalled.This is a really really dumb book. So dumb that I had a hard time getting my snark out. You can tell by all the gifs I used herpderp. Whatever.

Armentrout and Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer. Only this time there are no vampires or aliens. This time the girl deals with angels.The premises and the characters are similar in these three series (Lux, Twilight and Hush Hush). A small town where everyone knows everyone. The local school. A girl with no many friends and with a single parent who is almost no existent in her everyday life.Nora will be interested in the weird, extremely good looking boy in her class who (for some strange reasons) will become her class partner and they need to do projects together.Patch is a boy who is interested in Nora and not interested in Nora at the same time, who helps Nora and then intimidates her and who talks with riddles (ring any bells?).There are hot situations between them and cold situations between them.

It\u2019s a wistful thinking that their relationship will finally develop)So, I have read a few negative reviews and I do not really understand what people expect.

Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick is dangerous. The messages in it, while most likely unintentional, defends stalking and attempted murder under the guise of love. The relationship between Nora and Patch is toxic, but the strange thing is that Nora knows this and yet is still being pushed into being sexually attracted to him. Unlike Bella Swan, who had no rational fear of Edward, Nora is given rational fear constantly. When Patch comes into her house, she says that by being alone he has the perfect opportunity to rape/murder her and it's revealed later that he did indeed plan to murder her and then a few moments later is thinking about how he makes her lady parts quiver. Patch spends this whole book being aggressive and patronizing to Nora, not to mention assaulting her mind. He puts her in uncomfortable and dangerous situations and Fitzpatrick allows Nora to fall for it every time. I can't even blame Nora, because it is obvious that the writer is the one navigating her decisions and causing her to act like a fool. Not once in this entire novel does Nora use common sense in action. Not once. It's disgusting to see how inept she was made in order to make this disgrace of a romance work. When it is revealed that Patch was trying to kill her, instead of running away, screaming and shouting, she asks him if he has a girlfriend. Seriously, what on Earth kind of reaction is that.Nora herself is just frustrating to read because, like I mentioned before, she does realize that Patch is dangerous, that she should avoid him at all costs. Yet, after she says this, she makes decisions that only put her and Patch closer together. Her best friend, Vee is a sham of a friend, who is back-handedly slut-shamed throughout this entire book for one and then tells Nora she's overreacting when trying to find out whose been stalking her. What a great friend to have, a victim blamer...Beyond the simple fact that the relationship in this book was horrible, one of the worst things in her was Patch's motivations. He wants to be coming human because he thinks it's awesome and the only way to do this is to either: sacrifice someone (Nora) or save someone and become a guardian angel. He willingly chooses the first one because being a guardian isn't his style. We are supposed to root for a lead who chooses to kill rather than save because it isn't his style? How can girls root for this guy? Let alone find him attractive. At least Edward has the excuse of being a \"vampire\" Patch has none, he's simply selfish and would rather treat people as a means to an end. So that's Hush, Hush. The tale of a homicidal-slightly psychopathic angel and a low-self-esteemed teenager who is in love with her killer. Except when you put it that was it actually sounds like something worth reading. This book has one of the worst casts of characters I've ever read, it borrows heavily from Twilight and promotes domestic violence on a level of which is morally disturbing.To anyone who might come on this review and attempt to defend this book, please don't. I respect the right of everyone to like what they like, but while many stories can be up in he air about the abuse by a male lead, Hush, Hush is very frank. Patch attempted to kill Nora many times and only failed because of his one ineptitude. Giving young adults these types of books is dangerous. I know we always say that teens are smart enough to come to their own conclusions and it's true, we are. However, this book trivializes what millions of men and women go through every day at the hand of their partners. Domestic abuse isn't something anyone chooses to get into, they are manipulated and coursed into trusting someone; into believing that they are in love. It is this love that makes them stay. Most of these people are insecure (much like Nora is) and are easily taken in by a more charismatic and mysterious partner. Instead of taking this book and using it to show warning signs of abuse (most of which Patch exhibits), it takes those same tactics which are used to manipulate people every day and romanticizes it. This book is dangerous and irresponsible.
