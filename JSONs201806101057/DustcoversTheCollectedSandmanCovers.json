My parents told me true things.\n--/--\nSo I believed in the Sandman, when I was three. Ask me if I still do.\nWhen this \u201cLast Story\u201d was written, obviously the storyarc Overture still wasn\u2019t written, so the meaning of being the \u201cLast Story\u201d isn\u2019t about when it was written, but that not matter how much more about The Sandman would be written in the future, THIS short story ALWAYS will be \u201cThe Last Sandman Story\u201d.It\u2019s a very personal tale of Neil Gaiman and his own experience with the main character and other support characters, while he was working with them and how he met them in the real world.Priceless short story. I am truly glad that I was able to read it. Greatness isn\u2019t about how many words are in the narrative, but how they are managed and how much they impacted in your soul.\nTHE COVERS\nHonestly I expected something else, something more detailed, since I believed that I\u2019d get deep explanations about what each cover meant and/or the particular reason of the use of elements on each cover.You certainly get some comments about the covers, but the most of them are too general or the behind-the-scenes process while doing the covers. That\u2019s not bad, however I did expected to read deeper information about what the artista (Dave McKean) wanted to express on each cover.It\u2019s artwork, I can understand that it\u2019s much about what each person thinks about them, like paintings in a museum, no doubt the painter wanted to say something, but at the end, it\u2019s what each observer makes out of them. I get it. However, usually the paintings in a museum don\u2019t come with a guide by the painter. Here, my impression about the whole point of publishing such a book like this one, it was to expose the inspirations of the artist behind each cover. You don\u2019t need explanations to appreciate the covers, but again, if a book is published about the subject, well, the least that anyone can expect is to receive something with real content, deep information, and not comments kinda superficial that at the end they didn\u2019t gave away much additional about what you could already perceive about the covers of each comic book issue and TPB editions.\nSATISFIED NEVERTHELESS\nStill, thanks to \u201cThe Last Sandman Story\u201d, I am satisfied with my purchase of the book. Also, since it\u2019s the hardcover edition having an actual dust cover, that considering the chosen title of the book, it\u2019s indeed a key element to have, if you seek for this particular book. And certainly a cool collector\u2019s item in any The Sandman-related collection."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Since I got other unread Gaiman-McKean collaborations out of the library, I got this even though I own all the Sandman volumes that at least include each of these fabulous 75 covers, but in this book you get an inside view of the process, commentary, email exchanges between them. If you are reading Sandman, you may just zip right through the cover to get to the story, but the story would not be the same without these covers. Gaiman had different artists throughout but always buddy McKean's amazing dark fantasy artwork framing it all, giving it a kind of aesthetic framework for it all. It's good to slow down and just see them for what they are: Works of dark and sensuous art."}, {"userName": "Sofia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124769-sofia", "userReview": "Posted on my book blog.A book about the wonderful work of Dave McKean for the Sandman comics. There really isn't much else to say - if you love Dave McKean's artwork you will love this book. Each cover has a story, and all the little details will have you stare at the images for a long time. It's interesting to see how his work evolved over the years, and the commentary from both the artist and Neil Gaiman (who also wrote a short story for the book) is funny and insightful.Definitely worth it if you're a Sandman fan. If you're not, I'm sure you'll be interested in checking it out after you read this book."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13784911-paul", "userReview": "A compilation of all the Sandman covers done by McKean...LSD FOR THE EYES !"}, {"userName": "Gary Butler", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5483721-gary-butler", "userReview": "5th book read in 2016.Number 154 out of 498 on my all time book list.Review Pending:"}, {"userName": "D.M.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1463719-d-m", "userReview": "I love Dave McKean's art, so even if I weren't a Sandman fan this book would've been in my library. As it is, it was McKean that got me into Sandman (and vice versa), so this was a natural.While this oversized book does collect all the individual issue covers for the Sandman series including the special & gallery issues (all sans title, price, logo, indicia, etc.), it is by no means a comprehensive collection of the Sandman-related covers. Almost none of the hardcover collection jackets are herein, and (I think) not all the softcovers, but there are a few extra non-Sandman pieces, as well as some trading card art and nearly every other page has an additional piece of McKean ephemera.The book is designed by the man himself, with 'commentary' by he and Gaiman, as well as an all-new story penned by Gaiman & illustrated beautifully by McKean. It's a gorgeous package overall, and a must-have for any McKean fan (and a should-have for Sandman fans)."}, {"userName": "Jaimie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8659422-jaimie", "userReview": "Because I was only a baby when the Sandman single issue comics were being released I am extremely glad that this collection of the original covers was published. Someday, I might be lucky enough to have some of the original issues, but for now I'll have to be satisfied with the collected edition graphic novels and supplementary commentary publications. This book is very useful not only as a mode of collection, but as a presentation of additional commentary by McKean and Gaiman on the creative process behind the creation of the cover imagery. I especially found their ongoing argument about fish hilarious, and the synchronicity of having them create a story and cover with fish on a leash without actual discussion was an interesting piece of trivia about the series and the creative process."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22486050-jon", "userReview": "I've been a fan of Dave McKean for most of my life. Between his work on various comics and album covers for the likes of Front Line Assembly, Download and Skinny Puppy, McKean was a massively influential part of my youth....And while you judge me on my taste in music as a teen, let's move on to the book, shall we?Neil Gaiman's The Sandman is probably my favourite comic series of all time, and Dave McKean's cover art was always an essential part of the experience: dark, dreamlike and utterly surreal - hauntingly beautiful, yet undeniably nightmarish. In Dust Covers, Dave and Neil guide us through a tour of the full set of Sandman cover art, with commentary and anecdotes for each and every one.I can't rate this highly enough.
