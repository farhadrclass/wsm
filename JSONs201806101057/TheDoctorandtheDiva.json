The book centers around an extremely talented woman, Erika Myrick, her wealthy and business-minded husband, Peter, and a successful obstetrician, Dr. Ravell. Erika and Peter have been trying to get pregnant for many years, but without any success. By the time they consult Dr. Ravell, Erika has given up any desire she may have had to become a mother and has resolved to finally go to Italy and pursue her dream of becoming an opera singer. Peter is almost desperate that his wife become pregnant, due to both his longing for a child and his need to bind Erika to him in what he assumes will be an irrevocable manner. Ravell is caught in the middle, torn between wanting to give the Myricks the child they've been hoping for, see Erika fulfill her dream, and do what he can to keep her near him. A spontaneous decision by one of these characters acts as a catalyst for all that follows, as their competing desires inexorably push them down a path of unintended consequences. This book explores the strange dynamic that emerges between a married couple and their doctor and how each of their choices and actions impact their own lives, as well as one another's.McDonnell used her husband's family history as inspiration for this book: his great-grandmother left her husband and young son to pursue a singing career in Italy. The author says she felt conflicted about the idea of a woman abandoning her family for the sake of her art: \"Did I admire her and want to applaud her courage? Or was it heartbreaking that she'd deserted her little boy?\" (from the author's website). These conflicting emotions are at the root of the story and McDonnell does a superb job of arousing the same opposing feelings in the reader and leaving us torn between these two reactions. Also central is the question of what it is that makes a parent: Blood, genes, and chromosomes? Time, affection, and devotion? How often the child is in your thoughts and prayers, no matter the distance? All - or any - of these?The book spans the years 1903 to 1914 and travels between the privileged neighborhoods of Boston, a boat in the Atlantic Ocean, a coconut plantation in Trinidad, the jungles of Guiana, and the streets and opera houses of Italy. An added bonus is the fascinating information McDonnell provides about fertility and gynecology in the early 1900s. As she points out in her historical note at the end of the novel, many practices that are seen today as \"modern\" and \"groundbreaking\" are actually neither. Consider this: the first recorded case of successful artificial insemination was performed in 1785 by Scottish surgeon John Hunter!! Also interesting was the novel's exploration of the complex and intimate relationship that developed between male obstetricians and their (obviously female) patients, whose bodies they knew and understood in ways that often neither the women themselves, nor their husbands, did.McDonnell's writing is both simple and rich; there is a softly poetic quality to it and every word and sentence seems to have been carefully chosen and crafted. The story and characters truly come to life within the book's pages and I couldn't help but feel myself emotionally involved and implicated as I read it. I am someone who cannot usually tolerate anything having to do with adultery - even if it's a completely fictional novel or film - so the fact that McDonnell had me feeling so engaged was both a surprise and a testament to her talent as a storyteller. The complex love triangle that makes up this story drew me in almost from the beginning (if it can be called that, because this \"love triangle\" doesn't really follow the normal pattern one expects).Although a lot of changes and life events take place, in the end it's a character-driven story and Erika, Peter, and Ravell are written well enough to pull it off. They are complex, interesting, passionate, and imperfect people. They are not always likable and sometimes their actions or decisions leave the reader feeling anger, dismay, repulsion, and/or pity. The three of them seem propelled down a murky path that you can't envision engendering anything but heartbreak and tragedy; it's almost like a car crash you can't look away from, however it's much, much subtler than that and often feels almost anti-climactic. All three are vividly portrayed and in the end these two men and one woman are much like real people: neither wholly good/right, nor wholly bad/wrong. Instead, they are essentially human, and we come to feel an affection and sympathy for them, however unwilling it may be at times.The book is written in third-person, but all three have sections written from their point of view; this was something I appreciated as it gave me a degree of access to and insight into all of them. One thing I will note is that we never know Dr. Ravell's first name - he remains throughout either \"Dr. Ravell,\" or \"Ravell\" to his friends. I only started to take note of this a little ways into the book, so although it's possible I missed this somewhere in the first few chapters, I know that that's the case for almost the entire book. This is interesting given the fact that Erika and Peter become \"Erika\" and \"Peter\" towards the beginning and are referred to as such from then on by the narrator and the other two main characters. Also, whenever Ravell and Erika are together without Peter, the story was always told from Erika's point of view. These may seem like minor things, but they shaped the tone of the story, albeit in subtle ways.I only have a few specific criticisms. The character of Christopher, a young American accompanist who becomes much a part of Erika's life in the second half of the novel, pretty much disappears at the end and we don't know what happens to him - or his two friends. I also felt that when Erika finds out what Ravell did at the beginning of the book, her reaction was not at all what I would have expected; it was appropriate for about three lines and then she seems to almost completely dismiss the entire event. I think more could have - and definitely should have - been made out of this, especially considering the various things it puts in motion and the consequences it ends up having for all three characters. Finally, parts of the ending were a little too pat for me. Not everything is tied up with a neat little bow - how could it be?! - but the conclusion nonetheless seems to fall a little short; we thought we were slowly climbing to some jarring result or eye-opening hard truth, and instead we're thrown a loud side twist, while the central story is then quietly laid down at our feet. The \"loud side twist\" could have really worked if it had been altered a little and used to end the overall story. This would have left us with a very tragic ending, \u00e0 la Anita Shreve, but it would have been an appropriate one and would have worked in a literary sense. In conclusion, The Doctor and the Diva was an enjoyable read - an engaging novel centering around three original, compelling, and flawed characters. I would definitely recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction, opera enthusiasts, and most female readers. Additionally, it abounds with issues that could stimulate wonderful group discussion, so I think it would be a *superb* book club selection (especially if it's a coed book club - could lead to some very interesting conversations!).RECOMMENDATION: This novel reminded me very much of Catherine Texier's Victorine, an extremely wonderful book (4.5 stars) that I finished in one day, if I remember correctly. This novel also centers around a mysterious and intriguing woman from the author's ancestors and explores her struggle between responsibility and family duty, and her pursuit of passion and independence. In the case of Victorine, Texier's great-grandmother is the featured heroine - a French woman living at the end of the 19th century who leaves her husband and children to go to Indochina with her lover.This review is of an advance reading copy provided by the Amazon Vine Program."}, {"userName": "Sandi *~The Pirate Wench~*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1849875-sandi-the-pirate-wench", "userReview": "\"Rich historical romantic debut novel?\" Rich alright..bad writing that was all over the place,characters I couldnt connect with at all to even TRY and get into the story.

The first half was awesome I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Infidelity, low morals and loose judgement was a major part in this book. Though I know that type of read is not for everyone it started to tell a great story. It's not a YA and I don't want anyone to confuse this as so. Have you read a book that you liked so much then something so wrong happened that you just couldn't do anything but have dislike for the whole book even though most of the book was awesome? Well that's what happened for me. I am a mother and a wife and though I don't believe in cheating and all the crazy things that happened in this but I can enjoy the story that is told. Crazy is just part of life. That is until a mother can up and leave her own child it was horrifying to me. The way it happened was painful. I just couldn't believe a mother would be that selfish as to worry about a career then her own child. No matter how or why she got pregnant.Unfortunately This was not my type of book. Well it was until that part with the mother leaving her child. Anyhoo I don't know If I could recommend this to anyone with out telling you how I really felt. I would read more writing from Adrienne McDonnell because she was able to hit the era and had a way with words.

The premise is fascinating and proves the old adage \u201cLife is stranger than fiction\u201d is true, since much of this story is based on true events. The author clearly spent massive amounts of time researching the period (turn of the 20th century) because it is rich in little details. I also like how she doesn\u2019t shy away from showing the way certain issues, people were treated back then, but had her MC embody a more progressive, down-to-earth and compassionate attitude toward those same things. All in all a very good first novel. I wonder, has she written anything since? I hope so."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30575518-sandra", "userReview": "I am extremely conflicted about this book. On the one hand the different settings are inspiring as is the fact that it is about fertility doctors and opera singers. Both of which I know very little and I am always keen to learn about things that I know nothing off. It could have been so intriguing.Sadly I am now out of positive things to say. First though let me say I fully agree with women combining carreers and motherhood. All throughout history women have done exactly that. Maybe not rich women, but still it has always been done. In fact I think it is good that you have ambitions and hobbies and dreams that are seperate from parenthood. Its like I don't expect children to sit on their parents lap 24/7. So far I completely understand. I also understand that there can be reasons parents do not raise their children themselves. They can be ill, they can be financially unable, etc, but the fact remains that all these reasons must be solid. I don't get Erika's.So here you have Erika von Kessler, she is rich and lives comfortably, she sings and is trying to have a baby. This is obviously not working so well, but I assumed she actually wanted a child. Why else go through all the effort and if she truly did not and if she wanted to pack her bags for Florence she should have done so long before the start of this novel. Yet after a stillborn child she decides she wants to produce a living baby. Again producing a living healthy baby is the wish of any woman who wants children, but the fact remains that motherhood starts once that healthy baby is born. That is when the real work begins, but no she finds it draining, no matter how much she loves him. So in the end she decided to leave him and her husband and go fulfill her true dream of becoming an opera singer in Florence at the cost of her son. She could have aimed to become the best opera singer in the entire North East of the US, but no, somehow that just wouldn't do. Even if it meant she could be part of her sons life.Now Ravell, really, what was he thinking? I get it no doubt his job was quite modern and maybe even shocking back then, but having affairs with patients was a no go even for a GP so to think that he was unaware of how bad an idea this was for him is impossible. The fact is he is supposed to help other couples have children, not have affaires with the wives or become so infatuated with one of them that he decides he will give her a baby. That is stupid at best and creepy at worst and either way deeply unethical. Also for him to continue this love/obsession/lust or whatever it was without seeing her for 9 years, not even having received a note that is very odd. At some point we must all move on, preferably to a healthier relationship, but sadly that is not what happened here. Peter, Erika's husband, is the only one I can relate to (even if it is only a little). He does not mind his wife singing, even if it is not his own great passion, but he also wants her to be home long enough to help raise their son. Which is not unreasonable. I can understand why he does not want to risk everything he has into this gamble of moving abroad in hopes his wife might, I repeat might, become a famous opera star. In the end they were ill suited and should have been better off not married to each other. He is also the one, despite those frequent trips oversees that he has to do for work, who takes the great interest in Quentin. He is not the one who just talks about missing him, he is the one who has actually shown up the most. One has to give him credit for that as he is loyal to that boy eventhough he is not his by blood. So it is not just empty words of affection for him.Lastly there has to be Quentin, I do feel for him. He sounds like such a sweet and loving boy and he is loyal to his mother even when she took off and decided her voice should come before her son, even when so many women have managed to combine both ambition and family life. Not always equally successfully, but at least they were trying. I don't fully know how far Quentin is aware of this, at least in this stage of his life, but I get the feeling that his mother at some point just becomes a novelty to him instead of someone he can truly depend on. That does not bode well for his relationship with his mother in the future. Though this is of course not his fault. I liked reading about him.So given the length of this review I can't but say I found it one of the more frustrating books I have ever read. It could be a story of how one combines what one is passionate about with the day to day struggles, but that chance was gone when she decided she could not live without Florence and its opera. Even at some point saying, as she tried to teach her son how to put on his shoes, that she had no life or something to that effect. I felt so sad at that moment for Questin and I was certain then that I would not like where this was going."}, {"userName": "Tami", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3660626-tami", "userReview": "Wonderful read! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Stunning to realize it's a debut novel. While taking place in the decade preceding WW1, the storyline is one that could easily revolve around women today thinking about, or actually balancing, careers with motherhood ...and Erika's struggles to decide her future at each crossroads in her life certainly rang true and authentic to me (being a similar age, in a similar situation, with similar thoughts and feelings). This is ultimately a story about fallible human beings trying to be true to themselves, and as fair as they can to those around them. Erika & her husband Peter meet Dr Ravell, a renowed fertility specialist, in a last-ditch effort to start a family (at Peter's insistance - Erika herself remains ambivalent). Erika and Ravell begin a complicated relationship with ultimately life-altering consequences for both. In the meantime, Erika decides to go to Italy to further her operatic career (with mixed success), leaving her husband and young son in the States. A professional scandal sends Ravell to his Trinidadian estate, and one wonders if they will ever cross paths again.The beautiful settings (Boston, Trinidad, Florence) and operatic world in which Erika moves perhaps serve to allow the normal human-ness of the characters to shine through. The character and story development never feels rushed or short-changed. I never got the feeling that there was a story or piece being missed, either - one that would have made this book any better. Each character is given a voice in the novel (parts are told from each of their perspectives), which serves to \"get into the head\" of all of them and really understand why they made the decisions they did (especially Ravell's decisions while Erika was his patient..one major one, in particular) and not judge them, but just be interested in them, and fascinated by them. The chapters written from Quentin's perspective serve as a reminder of how a parent's choice can have a profound effect on the youngest of children. Loved loved loved the ending!! (though it came way too soon - this novel is 432 pages (verrrry sumptuous to hold!), I read it in 2 sittings - couldn't put it down!)The title of this novel does not do this novel justice..it's about so much more than the doctor and the diva."}, {"userName": "Happy Bookaholic", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4534616-happy-bookaholic", "userReview": "A hideous and callous tale that uses rape and absolute negligence\u2014which is at times fatal\u2014as an aphrodisiac for a cast of emotionally twisted characters. This is an utter waste of beautiful prose, intelligent research and true-life inspiration. Before readers swallow this bitter tale as a sad and poignant true story, they ought to be aware that none of the melodramatic events really occurred. The author states, on her website, that her ex-husband's ancestor abandoned her marriage and sons to pursue a career in opera on the European stages. There is a rumor in the family that before the boys were born, the woman gave birth to a female baby sired by someone who was not the man who ultimately fathered her sons. The only other truths to the story come in the author's own fascination with fertility practices of old. She wished to share her knowledge of the innovations that occurred hundreds of years ago and chose to incorporate it into her novel. Apparently the author thought that the historical activities of those doctors were not disturbing enough and so improved upon it with scenes that make a daytime soap opera seem as mild as a preschool cartoon.If you need to pay penance for some awful thing that you did and you have 13 hours to dedicate toward torturing yourself and abusing your humanity, go ahead and read. You might even wish to indulge in Orlagh Cassidy's narration of the audiobook\u2014at least you'll get something good out of the experience.Although one could argue that no book should be burned because every tale is worthy of being told, a small collection of books really challenge that belief and this is certainly one of them.

His actions of medically impregnating a woman with his own semon, when all along she believes its from her husband, are morally repugnant. And the convoluted explanations and seasonings that McDonnell gives him do not make sense. Erika, likewise, was conflicting - she wants a career, then she wants a child, then she leaves that child for a career. I believe McDonnell was trying to draw parallels from the \"modern woman's\" struggle to show how timeless the divide between motherhood and professionalism are. But rather than enriching the story, it made Erika come off as a flibbetygibbet, rather than a realistic woman caught in the epicenter of her own timeframe. I struggled with her selfcenteredness and her selfishness. Her later affair with Ravell was likewise unbelievable.Peter, on the other hand, felt flat and unfinished. I can't help feeling like he was a supporting character that moved in the currents of others, rather than taking his own organic path.

I can't imagine a mother leaving her child, or a man so desperate for a child he would knowingly let his wife have an affair to get pregnant and a romance lasting 9 years without contact. It's not that I'm unromantic, but it doesn't work that way. People would assume the other no longer was interested and lose interest themselves. Plus how could the doctor leave his only surviving son behind for a woman after the boys mother died. The more I write about this book the more irritated I am by it.

Her husband, Peter, has a differing opinion of Erica's career choice and is constantly herding her from one doctor to another in hopes of having their fertility issues resolved. When Erica and Peter engage the services of Dr. Ravell, Peter is very hopeful that Ravell's incredible advancements in the field will solve their problem once and for all. But Erica is far from being hopeful and it's her despondency over her infertility that prompts Dr. Ravell to make an extreme decision that will drastically alter all three of their lives forever. After the fateful decision of Dr. Ravell fails to bear fruit, Erica and Peter begin to grow apart and they once again rely upon the doctor to help them conceive a child together. When Erica's dreams of being an opera star begin to come to fruition, Peter, Ravell and Erica step into a dance of secrecy, deceit, and complicity that weave them together more tightly than any natural bond could ever hope to. Part historical drama and part love story, The Doctor and the Diva explores the conflicting desires of two men and one woman whose dream of the perfect child might just be their downfall.I had serious reservations about this book stemming mainly from the feelings the title gave me. Knowing nothing other than the title, I had expected this book to be more of a bodice-ripper rather than any type of serious piece of literature. What I found was actually very surprising, because McDonnell's skill brought forth a lot of sensitive issues and imbued them with a relevance and resonance that I found to be not only abundantly entertaining, but also very provocative and thoughtful.The situation early in the book between Erica and her husband was rather alarming. Erica's sole ambition is to become an opera singer and she was born with a voice to give this dream power. But Peter won't hear of Erica doing anything other than preparing herself to bear his offspring and forces her to consult with doctor after doctor in order to fulfill his desires. I was sad for Erica and felt that Peter was taking her dreams from her with his ceaseless badgering. The book made me feel a little angry at the realization that during this period in history, a woman existed solely to fulfill the desires of her husband and not much else. I grew apprehensive that Peter would end up controlling Erica's life and that her chance to sing would be extinguished. I didn't want Erica to get pregnant, because by doing so, she would be feeding Peter's ambition to control her life, and I felt that Erica didn't deserve that.When Peter and Erica meet Ravell, things begin to change. Far from being a proponent of Peter's ideas, he sees a side of Erica that no one else seems to. When he questions her about her desire to have a child, she admits that it's something that she wants but it's not the only thing, and that because she has been repeatedly thwarted in her efforts, she has now become focused on the opera. When Ravell makes his decision to do the impossible for Erica and Peter, he sets into motion a series of events that are irrevocable and intense. He will give Erica what she wants, in every sense, but to do this, he must not only deceive her, he must also pay the price for his actions. As Peter and Erica's lives begin to move in harmony, Ravell's begins to fall apart, and it's arguable whether this is Ravell's due.After a time, the three cross paths again, yet everything about them and their situations has changed. Curiously, Ravell remains dogged in efforts to please them both, though they both want very different things. In this respect, Ravell reveals his selflessness and altruism, but one can see that his motives are not always pure. As Ravell moves in and out of the couple's lives, he gives and takes in equal measure, and though Peter and Erica make their own choices, it's easy to see Ravell's hand in everything they do. These characters are all very interesting specimens, because while you can root for them and dream with them, they can also be very selfish and self-serving. In a few cases they can even become villains, though they all share this role equally. It's easy to see why they do the things that they do, but underneath, it's also easy to see how wrong they are.When the book reaches it's final section, three lives have come full circle, and it is time for dues to be paid. This is one thing I most liked about the book. No one gets off scot-free, no one can say that they've not had to make sacrifices and adjustments. There's an undercurrent of perfectly culled drama running through this story and it remains intact without ever getting hysterical or overblown. These characters grow and change and their lives become much more than they had been. The three are also somewhat diminished by their experiences as well, which is a point I feel was handled beautifully. So much gain, yet so much loss.Though I didn't expect to love this book, the fact is that I did and I think many others will as well. It was a touching story full of interesting ideas and perplexing questions, and those readers who like to get really invested in their characters' plights will find a treasure trove to keep them satisfied. The story was complex and involving without being overly florid and the book had the distinct advantage of being a bit on the unpredictable side. I know I'm going to be looking forward to reading more from this author and I urge you not to let the title of this book run you off.

One that entertains, enlightens and surprises. Opening at the turn of the 20th century in Boston, The Doctor and The Diva is the story of Erika von Kessler's search for herself. Opera singer wannabe Erika is happily married to successful botanist Peter. They would be a golden couple except for one thing, after years of marriage they have been unable to conceive a child. Erika is trying to reconcile herself to this but Peter still has hope and takes her to see yet another doctor. Dr. Ravell is a young, modern and up on the latest procedures obstetrician. That is as much plot as you know by the end of the first chapter and that is as much of the plot as I am going to tell you. I will tell you though that the first surprise I had with D and D was in that first chapter. that it wasn't the last and it wasn't about the medical techniques Dr. Ravell uses---although who knew? This is definitely an unpredictable novel. Unpredictable and yet true to it's time. There is a wonderful accomplishment. More than once The Doctor and the Diva made me think about Willa Cather's The Song of the Lark. Like Thea in Lark, Erika dreams of becoming an Opera singer. In each book the author writes eloquently about music, the time period, the struggles of the artist to pursue their art in the face of uncompromising circumstances, ambition and the desires for home and family. However where Thea has as many supporters as detractors along her journey, Erika's pursuit is a more solitary effort. In the development of Erika, Peter and Dr. Ravell, author Adrienne McDonnell has built up three distinct, interesting and flawed individuals. You root for the happiness of all three of them. McDonnell has done an equally fine job with the settings and historical detail. The Doctor and The Diva is a fascinating read.

I picked it up because it had an intriguing name and the story on the flap seemed interested.I almost abandoned the book halfway through as it was a heart-strings pulling kind of story. Set in the early 1900\u2032s, the book obviously revolves between Dr.Ravell and his patient \u2013 the diva Erika. Erika dreams big of going to Italy and being a singer but first she wants to give her husband Peter a child. Dr.Ravell is the helping Peter and Erika conceive a child of their own as he falls in love with Erika.A stillborn child, an accusation, end of career, lush tropics \u2013 the book has it allThe hardest part of the story is when Erika leaves her 4 year old son with her husband Peter and moves to Italy to pursue her dream.As a mother I often have doubts about the balancing act but Erika\u2019s decision was a heartbreaker.The best part of the story is the interactions between Erika and her 2 year old. With kuttyma being the same age \u2013 our conversations are very similar.The book ends well \u2013 happy endings indeed but it left me with more questions than answers on the personal end"}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2385123-sophie", "userReview": "I'd like to thank Goodreads FirstReads giveaways for this advanced reader's edition. A hopeful pick, as always. After finishing this novel, my strongest comment is that it's \"chick-lit\" trying to pass as historical romance. There's the historical setting, the forbidden affair, the disapproving family... but honestly, not a lot of romance. As a reader I never really connected with the characters; the descriptive writing was well presented, but the characters - even after 400 pages - fell flat. Throughout the novel I wanted to know more about them - especially how Erika and Peter met or what exactly keeps the romance going long distance for eight years - but Erika and Ravell struck me as rather empty. So getting back to my point, I don't think this works as a historical romance novel. However, it is an interesting read from the perspective of women's role in the workforce (and not in the home). And had the novel been written more strongly in that tone - with more emphasis on Erika's point of view / personal struggles as a woman, and less on attempted romance - I think The Doctor and the Diva would have been a more relevant, captivating read."}, {"userName": "Holly Weiss", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3455463-holly-weiss", "userReview": "\"I Swear I Will Win\"\u201cLo giurai, la vincero.\u201d Mezzo soprano Erika von Kessler sings these words in an Italian opera aria while fulfilling her dream of a stage career toward the end of this book.

But I really am challenged to say very many nice things about this particular novel.I found ALL of the characters (except poor Quentin) to be the most selfish, egotistical, self-absorbed lot of people lacking morals I have probably ever read about. I wanted to like at least one of them but just couldn't find anything redeeming in any of them. In fact, I found myself hoping for the demise and failure of each them throughout the entire book.I listened to the audio version and although the narration was good, it was a major commitment. At one point I thought surely this thing must almost be done, only to pick up my device and realize that I was't even half way through.

The author is relatively unknown, this is perhaps her best known work. Do not let that phase you, because The Doctor & The Diva is marvellous. At times, you feel as if you are walking alongside Erica and pursuing her operatic dreams with her. It is difficult to underestimate her character, because throughout it is easy to envision her dreams becoming true. Sadness, deception, beauty, fame, romance and desperation entwine in this book. Picture the wonderfully described scenes... This book might as well become a mini film reel inside your head. I hope that the author stays true to the roots she has planted in this story, and lets it guide her future work, just because her writing style is so different to many others. Articulate, artistic, astounding.

I was looking for something light in my to-be-read stack and I ended up with something that I couldn't put down. There were moments in this book when I felt myself in the room with the music, felt the vibrations through bones of the characters. The dilemma for a woman to either pursue her dreams of a career or investing in your family is something very pertinent for me right now. We all do what we trust we have to do, some may call it crazy, others call it brave...either way, I loved her and clucked at her through many chapters. At the end of the book I read the Acknowledgements and discovered that the book was inspired by true events and real people, with a little creative genius pulling it all together, which made the characters even more endearing to me.

On one hand, the book was solidly written. Beautiful prose, excellent \"readability,\" grand adventure, and a fascinating set of backdrops over which the story was imposed.On the other hand, the characters were so flawed that I found it almost impossible to root for any of them. This makes them realistic, but it also ensured that when I finished the book, I felt somewhat unsatisfied. Further, there was a huge revelation near the end of the story - readers will know what I mean - that the Erika character barely considered. It was an, \"oh, alright, that's not cool, back to my ambition,\" reaction, and I found that to be the least believable point in the story.I gave it four stars because it was incredibly thought-provoking, in addition to everything I said in the first paragraph.

It's not so much a historical novel as a soap opera with fun costumes and exotic locations. Now that I think about it, the book is a lot like an opera, which is fitting given the subject (and a literary accomplishment in itself). It just didn't wow me in terms of characters or suspense. You go to an opera primarily to enjoy the music, not to be drawn in by a well-crafted story; similarly with this book, you enjoy the beauty of the language and emotions but it's not the best *story* ever.

It was different, unorthodox, even immoral if you will. The characters are selfish to the point of annoying and how they acted, less than believable, but I enjoyed it. As dashing as Ravell sounded, I couldn't get into his character, nor Peter's. But I had no problem with their character flaws until Erika up and abandoned her child to pursue her career. As a mother, I find that appalling and didn't care for Erika after that, but that's probably the only issue I had. Really beautiful writing... Fluid, almost like poetry.

(And though I know I can't really rate it with a 1/2 star, this is how I often think of my book ratings, so at least I'm noting it's full status in the review!) Though there is certainly an element of romance to the story (or, more precisely, lust)and some medical history, too, the primary story line (in my opinion) has to do with making hard choices. Career or child? Professional status or ethical integrity? Husband or lover? These are the choices that drive the plot to the very end.

Dr. Ravell is a young Harvard-educated obstetrician with a growing reputation for helping couples conceive. He has treated women from all walks of Boston society, but when Ravell meets Erika-an opera singer whose beauty is surpassed only by her spellbinding voice-he knows their doctor- patient relationship will be like none he has ever had. After struggling for years to become pregnant, Erika believes there is no hope. Her mind is made up: she will leave her prominent Bostonian husband to pursue her career in Italy, a plan both unconventional and risky. But becoming Ravell's patient will change her life in ways she never could have imagined. Lush and stunningly realized, The Doctor and the Diva moves from snowy Boston to the jungles of Trinidad to the gilded balconies of Florence. This magnificent debut is a tale of passionate love affairs, dangerous decisions, and a woman's irreconcilable desires as she is forced to choose between the child she has always longed for and the opera career she cannot live without. Inspired by the author's family history, the novel is sensual, sexy, and heart-stopping in its bittersweet beauty.
