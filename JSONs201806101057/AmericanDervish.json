He was Excellent! I was quickly drawn into this story when at the beginning Hayat Shah, the son of Pakistani Muslim parents living on the outskirts of Milwaukee, orders a beef hot dog at a baseball game. By mistake it\u2019s a pork hot dog. It\u2019s Hayat\u2019s first time ever eating pork. He experiences an euphoric high: religious freedom! I knew just how he felt. I had never eaten a cheeseburger in my life until college.As a Jew... we didn\u2019t keep Kosher in our home... but there were a few rules we did live by. We didn\u2019t eat dairy products with meat products. Nor did we eat shellfish. Later as an adult when I did eat shellfish \u2014 turned out I was allergic. Back to this story:  .....very quickly....we learn about Hayat\u2019s college dating experience. NONE! He was a slow-developing young adult-sexually experienced-guy. I found his new college romance charming. He a Muslim. She Jewish. .....This story is never stagnant. There are many complex issues to ponder. Hayat begins sharing about his childhood with his girlfriend. Flashback to Hayat at age 12....suburban life for he and his immigrant- financially well-off family in the Midwest. We learn about Hayat\u2019s REAL FIRST CRUSH.... a boyish distorted love with his Aunt Mina - his mother\u2019s sister - who comes to live with them ( with her son around Hayat\u2019s age). There is so much chaos in their household. So much religious confusion. Hayat\u2019s dad wants nothing to do with traditional teachings of Islam. His mother does \u2014 but is chronically angry at her philandering husband with white woman. He is no prince of a husband \u2018or\u2019 father. Hayat\u2019s mother is constantly bashing her husband to young Hayat. She\u2019s a kick of a character...oh my!!! Inappropriate at times...but one self expressive woman. Aunt Mina - is very religious and teaches Hayat the value of Islam. She teaches him to pray and to memorize the Quran. By the time he got to college ....he \u2018still\u2019 he remembered his Quran teachings. Having it memorized came in handy for a college course he was taking. There\u2019s a lot going on in this novel...DRAMA..... religious differences, inner conflict questioning of society within the Muslim community, anti-Semitism, domineering men, guilt and sabotage, humiliation, affairs, hypocrisy, family turmoil, sexual awakening, oppression of women, etc.Lots of flaw characters.... I thought this was a very engaging book .... much to think about.... compelling and thought-provoking....definitely held my interest.

Having read it, what I\u2019m reminded of is that it is the book BUSINESS.Here\u2019s what I like about the book: it\u2019s visually provocative (the author has a film background); it\u2019s a quick and somewhat entertaining read; there are a few beautifully written passages. Basically, it\u2019s the book you take to the beach or read on a flight.But no big loss if it gets washed away or forgotten in a seat back. It\u2019s not a book that you will want to return to again and again---mostly because it lacks depth and subtlety. The characters are not human people but plot devices. The treatment of Islam is superficial and predictable: anti-Semitism, oppression of women, sexual repression. The tone is didactic and moralistic. There is something inauthentic and promotional feeling about the book. Basically, it feels like a paint-by-numbers book written in order to be controversial and made into a movie, which I reckon is quite likely.Final thought: This is a fast food novel.

The author beautifully and painstakingly narrates the impressions of a child as he struggles to understand the complexity of Islam and thus his own identity, through the controversial messages from many well meaning people in his life. It points to the biases bred through cultural and historical lenses, which have the potential to traumatize the minds of our next generations of Muslims in America. These biases can and (inherently) do shape the very existence of the young minds, unbeknownst to the people who love them the most, their parents and families, who are so caught up in 'their own world' and its challenges. Some of the challenges in this tale are universal to all Muslims while others are very individual to the book\u2019s protagonist, Hayat Shah.While the message of Islam is universal, the Muslims are not monolithic. Cultural influences and customary interpretations from around the world impact the way the religion of Islam is taught and practiced. With migration from around the world, Islamic Centers in America are like a \u2018mini United Nations\u2019, a melting pot of Muslims from around the globe, who bring in diverse customs and cultures adding to the beautiful tapestry of the Muslim fabric of America, thus adding to the complexity of understanding Muslims and Islam. Personally, the message of Quran which resonates with me is: \u2018Read and Reflect\u2019, as it emphasizes the use of intellect, reason and logic and discourages from blindly following the customs and traditions of ancestors, which may be contrary to the essence of the peaceful religion of Islam. The future of Islam and Muslims, like any faith community, depends upon our youth. With the ever increasing negative stereotyping of Muslims and Islam by parts of the media, clergy and politicians, it is our responsibility to the next generations to bring in an era of Islam, which stands for social justice, equality of all beings and peace. After reading Ayad Akhtar\u2019s book, American Dervish, I am convinced more than ever that the time and need for \u2018Ijtihad\u2019 is now, for ongoing contemporary narrative with contextual interpretation of faith and the Holy Quran, individually and collectively by scholars to help reshape and reframe the influence of religion on the mindset of next generation of Muslims, which engages them towards a peaceful coexistence in the world and peace within themselves.

It's not the kind of book you want to linger over or revisit with any eagerness.* But that's not the reason I give it such a low rating. Interesting, compelling books add to the story of stories. They appear fresh. Offer us something new. And, while it is true that every story tells us a tale we've already heard in one form or another, the good ones do it in a way which surprises the reader. This book, American Dervish, rehashes the old in a connect-the-dots, predictable way. I mean, what popular culture American narrative of Muslimness has not included:- oppressed Muslim women- tyrannical Muslim men- violent Muslim men- hypocritical Muslim men- anti-semitic Muslims- the repressiveness of living pork-free- Muslims screeching for rights - Muslims plotting to bomb stuffIt's all in here and yet, we are constantly being told how fresh this book is. Huh? It's sad because I was really excited when I first heard of American Dervish. An American Muslim growing up in the Midwest at such a pivotal moment in history? Wow. I was practically salivating at the depth and nuances such a narrative could open up in the literary world. Reading it, I was reminded of a quote from a brilliant writer friend of mine: No one seems to want to hear that other American Muslim experience, the one that doesn't jibe with the narrative that has already been told. The narrative that has been stamped with approval is the one that is bleak, depressing and troubling. So to make it big, a book has to repeat this message. That is exactly what this book regurgitates - Muslims are troubling people. And, disturbingly, the book world applauds. It's like a book featuring Black people which serves you the same tired stereotypes. Or, a Jewish family drama with that mama, the guilty son etc etc. Fresh? With this schtick though, there's more at stake than just awful stereotypes. This book is full of assumptions about Muslim men and their violent \"tendencies\". Some parts describing Muslim men read like caricatures devised by anti-semitic writers in pre-war Germany to fuel misconceptions of Jewish men. I like what one goodreads reviewer said about how it would be interesting if this book gets much more publicity as it would signify just how much of a platform has been funded for it. *(i.e. The writing doesn't stand out in a way to warrant the accolades.) Still, I am optimistic and continue to hold out for that awesome book that will give us a fresh take on the American Muslim experience. A beautiful compelling book - because American Dervish is definitely not it."}, {"userName": "Jill Lapin-Zell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2588865-jill-lapin-zell", "userReview": "Ayad Akhtar\u2019s \u201cAmerican Dervish\u201d is one of the most moving books I\u2019ve read in a long time. I won this book in a giveaway on Goodreads, and I\u2019m glad I did, because I might not have picked up this book otherwise, and then would have missed out on a most enjoyable read.This book grabbed me from the start and never let me go. Its characters are multi-dimensional and believably flawed, and the writing is exquisite. For example, the passages where the author describes Hayat\u2019s (who is actually telling his own story) spiritual awakening are particularly vivid and captivating. To be able to describe something so elusive and intangible is truly a remarkable thing. Similarly, the descriptions of Mina\u2019s preparation of tea transcends the mundane. It is one of the most magical and eloquent passages in the book. The writing is almost ethereal. The most profound and significant message in the book is how human beings deal with pain. Every character in the book endures pain; sometimes it\u2019s physical pain, sometimes it\u2019s emotional pain, and sometimes it\u2019s both, but it\u2019s always a defining experience for that character. One caveat: there are some scenes in the book which some readers could find disturbing due to their brutality and violence. However, these scenes are not at all gratuitous and are quite necessary to convey the message of Hayat\u2019s story. Not only do I recommend this book most highly, I also believe that it should be required reading in every multi-cultural studies class in every American high school and college. It will teach you about faith, love, despair and pain. It will resonate with you regardless of your religious and/or spiritual beliefs."}, {"userName": "Moin Hussaini", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8636586-moin-hussaini", "userReview": "The last time I experienced a book like this was after reading The Namesake. Its rare to come from this background and find literature that so accurately reflects your own personal experience.In the case of American Dervish, it is very true to the emotional experience of a young Muslim boy's experience with religion - both alienating and comforting. The characters as more extreme and interesting versions of people in my own life. However, with some I felt that the \"juiced up\" versions of these people resulted in their becoming caricatures (e.g. the orthodox Muslims are made out to be bullies and antisemitic). In my experience, I've met orthodox Muslims without an ounce of bigotry and westernized ones that are terribly racist and antisemitic. I think Akhtar could have been critical of religion without resorting to this Hollywood canard. Nevertheless, a beautifully told and engaging story.

He said that he thought that faith was an essential element in this country and this novel uses the Muslim faith as a way to explore that. It's not so much a book about being Muslim in America as it is a story about growing up and what it means to believe in God, understand the afterlife and also what it means to follow the practices of the faith into which you are born, either by following or rejecting the teaching(s) of your parents and one boy's journey through that. The main character, the ten year old boy Hayat, is first really introduced to the Muslim faith when his \"aunt\" Mina comes to live with his family from Pakistan. Mina is what we might refer to as a \"spiritual\" Muslim - she is quite devout but she places greater importance on the intention of faith than the actual practice (example, Hayat studies and memorizes the Quaran ... but in English. He is later told that \"doesn't count\", it has to be in Arabic. Mina tells him that it's not the language that counts, it's the intention of memorizing it to be closer to God). Hayat's Mother is a Muslim in name and appearance but not in real practice and Hayat's father is essentially an atheist. Hay at has to figure out whT he believes and what is important to him.The characters in Hayat's immediate family are complex; loving but flawed and that was definitely one of the strengths of the book for me. I had a harder time accepting the more stereo-typical characters in the greater Muslim community. I saw them as archetypes and I suppose that those profiles exist for a reason but those characters, and therefore their interplay into the novel didn't ring quite as true for me.The writing felt like most of the \"literary fiction\" I've been reading lately ... easy enough to read but not transporting. This was a novel of character and plot, not writing or transcendental ideas (despite the inclusion of Quaran passages and many exerpts from and references to R.W. Emerson).Good story which will make for a good book club discussion. I recommend it but it's not an \"all-time great\""}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1534691-jennifer", "userReview": "Round up my review of 1.5 stars to 2 I guess. This was a hard book for me to get through. When I was given the galley at Book Expo I was told that it was the next \"Kite Runner.\" I should've known better when anyone says a book is the next anything. I really wanted to enjoy this as I feel stories from Asia in general are under represented in the U.S. and am sure that Middle Eastern stories have been on the rise in the past decade. \"American Dervish\" is a coming-of-age story for a young Pakistani-American boy, Hayat. The main story is in the relationship of him between his Aunt Mina, how her residing with his family affects their life, and how Hayat's love for her grows into a dedication to the Muslim faith. His father is flawed as are his mother and those around him and then there's the feelings of love he has for Mina that are both natural and seem to straddle the line of romantic interest. The fact is the main drama is with the adults and as a child he is witness to them and told of them but not always a part of it, which I found to be the weakness. The fact that the whole story is told from his POV in a reflective manner and that he's not as in the drama as he should be that he doesn't confront his philandering father or his overly emotional and submissive mother or his faithful auntie in a bad relationship makes him very submissive and the story run a bit too long. I think much could've been cut and the protagonist of Hayat could have been more active especially since some of what he does is an impetus for later events. The end is rushed, but I did receive a galley so the ending and epilogue may have changed. But the ending was all told and not seen and the convenient reunion at the end seem very forced but I guess expected. I learned a lot about characters and how to utilize narrators and such from reading \"American Dervish.\" And am sorry I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. I did appreciate being involved in the culture and the racism and prejudices but these are things as someone who is friends with people of this culture was aware of already. So perhaps for others it will be quite revealing but for those already in the know, not so much."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7458043-maggie", "userReview": "More like 1.5 stars.I felt excited to read this book after hearing the author being interviewed on NPR\u2019s Fresh Air. On air, he sounded unsure of himself and, at the same time, very opinionated---a combination I really like for reasons I won't go into here. Akhtar\u2019s bio is intriguing...Ivy-educated, actor, playwright and student of Sufi masters (!). Sadly, his novel is disappointing compared to his punditry. I bet, though, he\u2019d write fabulous essays.American Dervish is a good, quick read but it lacks nuance. What should be complex issues (clash of Islam and the West, sexual awakening, family turmoil, oppression of women) and complex characters end up feeling flat and one-dimensional. None of the characters come to life with any humanness (maybe with the exception of the boy\u2019s father); none of them are particularly likeable. And it doesn\u2019t help that the plot is predictable and the writing spotty. The book does not feel primarily like a novel but more like a platform for a talking head role for Akhtar on all topics Muslim-American. The experience of reading it often left me wondering if a marketing dept wrote the book.I\u2019m pretty puzzled by the good reviews here and elsewhere. (For my money, the most honest editorial review of this debut novel is in Publisher\u2019s Weekly.) It may simply be that Akhtar is bright, personable and has got a good schtick and that the publisher has got deep pockets. Or if I drop the cynicism, it could be that for those readers who are new to the life of immigrants, coming of age tales and the range and contradictions of religious belief, American Dervish is a decent, if simplified, introduction. But for those more engaged with these concerns, the novel is facile and pedantic and doesn\u2019t grasp the subtlety of human relationships.

This book held my interest from page one. It's a story about a Muslim-American family during the 80's and particularly the young boy, Hayat. I'm not going to summarize the plot. I will say the refreshing perspective Mr. Akhtar focuses on is that while they are Eastern in ethnicity and Muslim, their issues, inner conflicts and questioning of society within the Muslim community as well as their local community is universal. I've read books with Jewish and Christian characters torn between their religious upbringing and society's expectations. I'm guessing some people won't like it because it focuses on the hypocrisy and dogma that religion has.

In the first few pages of the novel, he is getting ready to share his life story to a young Jewish woman with these words: \u201cYou may not like me very much if I tell you what happened\u2026\u201dBut we do. As readers we do like Hayat as he reveals the good, the bad, and the ugly of his story, which begins when his mother\u2019s best friend Mina departs from Pakistan and her controlling ex-husband with her small son. Hayat \u2013 at the cusp of adolescence \u2013 develops a serious crush on Mina, who encourages him to immerse himself in the Qur\u2019an. Pretty soon, Mina falls for a Jewish doctor \u2013 the partner of Hayat\u2019s father and his new sense of purpose merges with his growing sense of \u201clove\u201d and confused feelings of betrayal.It\u2019s not only an intriguing but also a timely premise, as thoughtful Americans strive to gain greater understanding of \u201cwhat it means to be Muslim.\u201d And I believe the book has much to offer a young adult or mass market audience who likes a linear story with an educational twist. The story has an interesting protagonist, a story arc, and has much to say about the push and pull of secular, mystical, and religious Islam, the evolving role of women, and the confusion that accompanies growing up Muslim in America.However, like many plot-driven made-for-TV movies, American Dervish doesn\u2019t dig nearly enough, not providing its characters with enough of an inner life, and sacrificing depth for a fluid story line. The result is often platitudes and melodrama, with messages strongly telegraphed. Here is Hayat\u2019s mother, speaking to him: \u201cListen to me and never forget what I\u2019m telling you. If you give yourself to filth and garbage, you will become filth and garbage. You will become the sum of what you desire\u2026Promise me behta. Promise me you won\u2019t end up like him. That you won\u2019t live your life like him.\u201d And here is Mina\u2019s Jewish suitor, Nathan: \u201cThe way he has those people beholden to him. It\u2019s revolting and immortal. And it has nothing to do with real Islam. Nothing at all.\u201d Or mother talking about her friend Mina: \u201cI keep telling her the fact that Nathan\u2019s Jewish is a good thing. They understand how to respect women, behta. They understand how to let a woman be a woman, to let her take care of them.\u201dAyad Akhtar \u2013 an actor, playwright and novelist \u2013 is obviously striving to contribute to Muslim-Jewish (and Muslim-American) understanding, which is a very worthy goal and a good thing. But by leading the reader to conclusions and by simplifying premises, the book just doesn\u2019t rise to high literary standards.

Scott FitzgeraldAyad Akhtar's novel, American Dervish, begins with a prologue: Hayat, a Pakistani-American college student, is eating his first pork at a basketball game and exulting over his new freedom from the claims of religious faith. The novel then flashes back to Hayat's boyhood, his memories as a 12-year-old, living with his immigrant, but well-off, family in suburban Milwaukee.I began reading with the expectation that Akhtar was about to give us a Muslim counterpart to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. And, indeed, like Joyce's autobiographical novel, American Dervish is a story of an adolescent boy who, after a period of being deeply devout, becomes disillusioned with his faith. Also, like Joyce, Akhtar reveals the beauty and wisdom of that faith, as perceived by the youth, as well as how religious belief can be used to narrow rather than open the mind of a sensitive and intelligent child. But where Portrait of the Artist is almost solipsistic in the narrator's focus upon himself, American Dervish's primary focus returns repeatedly to an older woman: Mina, the best friend of Hayat's mother, whom the boy calls his aunt.Hayat's family does not fit easily into the local Pakistani community. His father is a physician, an unbeliever, and an irritable but loving father. His mother has little interest in religion as such, but clings to the traditions of Islam out of homesickness for the Pakistani Punjab. Hayat himself is a quiet boy, but initially seems totally American -- Midwestern and suburban in his life and interests.But then, when he is 12, Aunt Mina, a strikingly beautiful woman escaping an abusive arranged marriage, arrives from Pakistan to live with Hayat's family. Mina reveals to Hayat the beauties of Islam, teaches him to pray, teaches him to memorize the Quran. Without understanding his own feelings, Hayat falls in love. Romantic love for an \"aunt\" clearly being impossible, he instead throws himself into her love of Islam. He abandons former pasttimes, spending all his free time memorizing verses.\"Almighty God,\" Muhammad said, \"let me see you.\"And all at once, he saw nothing but the Lord. He looked to the right and saw nothing but the Lord. He looked to the left and saw nothing but the Lord, and to the front, and the back, and above...and everywhere he looked, he saw nothing but the Lord. What the Lord looked like Muhammad would never say, other than that His beauty was so great he would have preferred to stand there gazing at Him forever.But Mina is unlike other members of the local Pakistani community, Muslims whom Hayat's father contemptuously describes as \"sheep.\" She is intelligent, cosmopolitan, and delights in the freedom of American society. She contantly reminds Hayat that forms of worship aren't important to God, what's important are the intentions of his heart. Memorization of the Quran -- which he's told would guarantee his parents' admission to Heaven -- is worthless if he doesn't understand what he is memorizing. Mina is greatly influenced by the Sufi dervishes, mystics whose orthodoxy conservative Muslims have always considered suspect, holy men who seek to surrender everything that might separate them from God's love.What the dervish found was true humility. He realized that he was no better, no worse than the ground itself, the ground that takes the discarded orange peels of the world. In fact, he realized he was the same as that ground, the same as those peels, as those men, as everything else. He was the same as everything created by Allah's hand. ... He and Allah, and everything Allah created, it was all One.Much of the novel's plot describes how Hayat, in his frantic possessive love for Mina, sabotages her engagement with Nathan, a Jewish doctor and his father's partner, forcing her unexpectedly into a marriage with a more \"suitable\" local Pakistani -- a man so insecure that he spends his life locking her away from all other people and physically abusing her.Mina dies of cancer, after years of abuse, a woman crushed in both mind and body by events she could not control -- and events for which Hayat feels intense guilt. Shortly before Mina's death, Hayat visits her in the hospital -- where he finds her delighting in the Scott Fitzgerald quotation she'd found in his published letters -- and confesses how he ruined her life. She told him it was God's will:Faith has never been about an afterlife for me, Hayat. It's about finding God now. In the everyday. Here. With you. Whether I'm living in a prison or in a castle. Sick or healthy. It's all the same. That's what the Sufis teach. ... Every single life, no matter how big or small, how happy or how sad, it can be a path to Him.Hayat can't agree, can't understand the hold Sufi thought has always had on her. She replies that her pain is how God speaks through her.\"[E]verything, everything, is an expression of Allah's will. It is all His glory. Even the pain ...\" She paused. \"That is the real truth about life.\"In an Epilogue, Hayat, years later and now a college graduate working in Boston as an intern for the Atlantic, runs into Nathan in Harvard Square.

What makes it particularly stand out is that the protagonist, Hayat Shah, a 12-year-old Muslim boy isn\u2019t simply the victim of selfish parents or bullying schoolmates. He has a petty and vindictive side, too, and the novel focuses on the lifelong guilt he feels over one particularly cruel act that he\u2019s convinced changed the course of his \u201cauntie\u2019s\" life. The auntie, Mina, comes to America to live with Hayat\u2019s family after her arranged marriage in Pakistan fell apart because of her meddlesome and overbearing mother-in-law. But when her husband divorced her, he threatened to take custody of their son when the boy turned seven. To help her escape that fate, Hayat\u2019s mother, who was a childhood friend of Mina\u2019s, lets her and her son come live with them at their home in Milwaukee. Through Mina, a brilliant and religious woman, Hayat learns about Islam and the Quran for the first time. Hayat\u2019s father, Naveed, lost his faith after his sister died when the two were teenagers and he has nothing but contempt for the religious Pakistanis in their town, whom he sees as ignorant, backward, and hypocritical. Mina uses the Quran to teach Hayat how to appreciate every aspect of life and to live with ultimate humility before God\u2019s graces. She makes him want to become a \u201chafiz,\u201d someone who memorizes many verses of the Quran. Hayat believes that if he does, both he and his parents will get into heaven \u2013 a possibility that fills him with great hope because he worries that otherwise his father\u2019s philandering and drinking will make him burn in hell. The beautiful Mina is more than a religious inspiration to the na\u00efve Hayat. At 12, he still does not know what sex is, isn\u2019t even sure if women have different parts than men, and when he starts having wet dreams, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to him. Without understanding anything about sex, Mina is his first crush \u2013 a situation that becomes all the more complicated when he catches Mina in the middle of the night naked in the bathroom and on the verge of touching herself. As aroused as that image of her makes him, he doesn\u2019t use it for his own masturbatory fantasy, but instead tries to become more devout. But when Mina meets and falls in love with his father\u2019s partner, Nathan, Hayat does all he can to destroy that relationship, out of jealousy and because Nathan is Jewish. When Mina herself realizes the relationship with Nathan won\u2019t work because of their religious differences, her family\u2019s objections, and her son\u2019s desire for a father who isn\u2019t white, she settles for a marriage to a weak and mentally unstable but domineering Muslim man, and Hayat has to deal with years of guilt for sabotaging her one chance at happiness. Hayat\u2019s mother is a particularly strong character. She suffers the constant humiliation of her husband\u2019s affairs and opens up to her son about far more than she should, but when Mina lashes out at Hayat for trying to poison her son\u2019s mind about the prospects of a Jewish stepfather, Hayat\u2019s mother comes to her son defense and lets her best friend know she\u2019ll kill her even she ever touches her son again. Overall, this is a courageous book and one that offers a not very flattering look at the anti-semitism and misogyny of a small group of Muslims who use the Quran to justify their hatred of the Jews and, in some cases, men\u2019s right to beat their women. But this community of Muslims is no different, I suppose, than the Christian right when they use the Bible to justify homophobia. Here, Mina, provides the thoughtful counterbalance, by showing the goodness and humility the Quran can inspire when interpretations of it aren\u2019t use to justify mean-spiritedness and cruelty. There is a lot of wonderful moral complexity to consider here. Is Hayat responsible for Mina\u2019s fate or is Mina the one who set the ball in motion by filling his head with verses from the Quran and leading him to a mosque that would never accept Jews? Did Hayat\u2019s one sabotaging truly alter the course of Mina\u2019s life or did she make free choices along the way? It\u2019s a lot to ponder, and the author deserves considerable accolades for embedding these issues inside a highly entertaining and moving story with so many great, fully-rounded characters."}, {"userName": "Roxane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane", "userReview": "This is a fast read, a coming of age story about a young man who falls in love with his mother's best friend and makes a terrible choice that has terrible consequences.

It goes against the noise that seems to be everywhere in the news these days \u2013 protests, strife, discontent. It\u2019s a quiet, thoughtful story about a boy trying to make sense of his life navigating the difficult topics of religion (Islam) and his culture\u2019s \u201cdirty laundry\u201d \u2013 in this case, the neuroses of a Pakistani Muslim American family living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Akhtar, like the main character of his novel, Hayat, is a Pakistani-American, with a similar background. The book is (obviously) fictionalized to give him more artistic freedom. And given the turbulent nature of the material (Islam and its conventions) that\u2019s understandable.There are critics of his work, perhaps as it should be. This is not a novel meant to foment debate and yet I do feel it can be challenging to be a truth-teller in any culture. What Akhtar\u2019s written is both a story of a boy coming to terms with a youthful infatuation and a yearning for a sense of belonging \u2013 a sense of peace within himself, his family, and the wider culture.One of the choices he had to make was whether to write an academic dissertation of the state of the Muslim mind, a kind of Franz Fanon-for-Islam or a fully accessible work that conveys both the complexity of the situation as he sees it, but in a way that was not pedantic or overly academic. (And believe me, Akhtar, who teaches acting at a fancy school in Vienna and has degrees from Columbia and Brown could definitely have gone there.)But he chose the former, in short, he wrote something entertaining. And I think this was good \u2013 because let\u2019s face it, in the post 9-11 world, an illuminating book about growing up Muslim should reach as many people as possible, and the best way to do that is to make it, well, a good read.And yet, to see this only as a book about Islam is incorrect. If anything, American Dervish really is about how specificity can help us see universality \u2013 in the same way that Jeffrey Eugenides remarkable novel Middlesex, a story about a Greek hermaphrodite growing up in Detroit, is not really about any of those qualifiers \u2013 Greek, hermaphrodite, Detroit \u2013 but about how we all can begin to transcend the labels of who we think we are. I believe Akhtar is still on a journey to discovering the layers of this truth and I look forward to his future works. We as readers are well served to have this novel as a contribution to our greater understanding of each other. I think his words are a plea for reconciliation \u2013 with the past, with conflict, with love, and with the divine. Many of us are unwittingly seeking those answers, but it is the courageous work of artists who have the ability to make that quest conscious \u2013 to share their efforts in the hopes that it will help the world. Akhtar put that struggle to the page. As if to drive the point home, he writes: The branches lightly creaked and swayed in the breeze. The river softly coursed at the bank\u2019s edge.I kept listening. Another breath. And then another. And then again.And finally I started to hear it. It was only this:My heart, silently murmuring its steady beat.This passage comes at a moment when you think the main character is completely despondent, but it is instead a moment of clarity. He\u2019s finally found what he\u2019d been looking for.And this is why I am telling you \u2013 amidst all the noise, all of the drama, if you are quiet you will find there are people making works of goodwill. This is among them."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Told mostly in flashbacks to the early 1980s, this coming-of-age novel focuses on Hayat Shah, a young Pakistani boy growing up in the American suburbs. Much of the plot revolves around his first crush on his 'auntie' Mina, his mother's best friend, who comes to stay with the family having fled her parents and husband in Pakistan. With Hayat's Westernised family lacking in any strong religious convictions, it falls to Mina to teach him about Islam, and a combination of youthful confusion and his burgeoning 'love' for Mina results in the boy becoming obsessed with the teachings of the Quran. When Mina becomes involved with Nathan Wolfsohn, a Jewish friend of the family, Hayat's jealousy, emotional confusion and religious fervour lead him to take actions which - as you might expect - have terrible consequences for almost everyone.Hayat is an engaging, likeable narrator and his journeys, both personal and religious, are related in a believable style. The naive purity of his adoration of Mina is touching, and his relationship with his parents, often awkward but full of love, is sensitively portrayed. His religious awakening, too, is carefully handled - he experiences great enlightenment, but is also exposed at an impressionable age to extremist views which threaten to warp his mindset and damage those he cares for. As a backdrop, the multiculturalism of the local community is very interesting, although there were times when I wished I could step outside Hayat's first-person viewpoint and learn more about his family, neighbours and acquaintances.I found American Dervish a pleasurable enough read: however, it moves at a leisurely pace to say the least. Nothing dramatic happens until halfway through the book, and even then, the 'action' is very subdued. Although I liked the story throughout, I often found it difficult to summon up any motivation to keep reading, and spent chapter after chapter wondering exactly where it was going. The prose style is nice, and flows well enough, but it's occasionally clumsy: I did feel at some points as though the book could have benefited from better editing.This is not a story in which the characters are given neat, happy endings - Hayat is the only one whose life appears to reach a positive conclusion, and even then it's bittersweet. The sometimes bleak story arc is admirable, but it can make what happens seem dull at points, and the reader is denied the dramatic showdowns, romantic reunions etc that could have been portrayed in a less realistic version of this story. In the end, the realism of American Dervish is both a plus and a minus. It makes the book feel 'better', more literary, more of an achievement - but it also makes it far less compelling than it could have been."}, {"userName": "Sorayya Khan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2683005-sorayya-khan", "userReview": "In a post 9/11 world in which the market's interest in Islam rewards a certain interpretation of the religion, I had my suspicions when I learned of American Dervish a few weeks ago. But when I heard the author on NPR, I liked the way he spoke of writing and his motivation for the book and decided to read it. The novel is Hayat's coming-of-age story set in Milwaukee where his Pakistani parents are immigrants. It is a commentary on growing up Muslim in a particular kind of Muslim community in the US, traversing the fissures of an immigrant's home life in the Midwest with school and all else outside the home. But the novel is also, very specifically, a coming-of-age story that is intertwined with the discovery of Islam. Hayat doesn't think much about Islam until his mother's best friend, Mina, appears at the scene with her young son, Imran, and introduces Hayat to the Holy Quran, the Prophet, and the rewards of studying the religion. All the while, however, Hayat falls hard for Mina in the serious crush kind of way all of us can remember from our youth, and Hayat's relationship with Islam unfolds alongside his awakening sexuality.Ayad Akhtar's prose is blissfully simple, no curlicues or stylistic tricks, a relief to me, given some of the things I've been reading. The story he writes is easy to follow, the timeline direct. On the other hand, there were elements that got in my way of surrendering to the narrative. The constant and explanatory nature of Islam was distracting and, in my humble opinion, overdone. The reader, even if non-Muslim, does not require so many verses of the Holy Quran included, nor so much explanation. Further, did Ayad Akhtar have to concentrate so hard on all that is negative about the Pakistani immigrant community in the US? The stereotypes are never ending. The idiotic Imam and his lackies, for example. Must all the Muslim men be problematic: a drunkard, philanderer, wife-beater, opportunist? Also, I am skeptical of some of Akhtar\u2019s choices. The tendency of Hayat\u2019s mother to confide in her son as a confidante \u2013 and about his father, no less \u2013 does not make sense.But what finally pulled me in, what finally rang utterly and completely true, what elevated this piece of fiction to the realm of universality was this: Hayat does something so cruel, so mystifying and yet so completely comprehensible, a child of any background, pulled by any number of forces, might have done the same. His cruelty changes Mina\u2019s life, and thereby his and his family\u2019s as well. It becomes the secret, the burden, he carries inside him as he grows into a man. This is the devastating truth that made the book worthwhile."}, {"userName": "Sayema", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7014112-sayema", "userReview": "As a Pakistani Muslim American born and raised in the US, I was very excited when I heard about this coming-of-age story of a Pakistani American boy in the US written by a Pakistan American author. I also read positive reviews and, therefore, anticipated reading a nuanced, refreshing story with multidimensional characters reflecting an authentic Pakistani Muslim American experience. My anticipation quickly turned to dread as I read the first few pages of this novel, which describe the main character Hayat's so-called liberation and \"freedom\" from his religion as he sinks his teeth into a pork hot dog. The next few pages describe a college class in which the professor challenges the authenticity of the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an, while the protagonist Hayat happily follows along. It immediately struck me as an easy plot device for the author to portray the main character as one who has rejected his religion in order to gain freedom. I dreaded the rest of the story for fear that it would surely paint all Muslims as one-dimensional stereotypical caricatures...closed-minded extremists...but part of me hoped that that I would be wrong.Unfortunately, I was right. The cast of Pakistani and Muslim characters in this story covers the majority of stereotypes widely disseminated in society today: closed-minded, anti-Semitic Muslims; violent, abusive Muslim men; philandering, alcoholic hypocritical Muslim men; oppressed, fatalistic Muslim women. Aside from the one arguably nuanced character in the story, Mina, the rest of the characters are one dimensional. The negative portrayal of Pakistani Muslims as a whole was not only disappointing; it reeked of inauthenticity to me. There was a lack of nuance and a lack of humanity in these characters that rendered them unlikeable and unrelatable. I feel very let down. I hoped to read a story in which I could see a bit of my life experience within its pages. Instead, I read a story which panders to the mainstream Western narrative of Pakistanis and Muslims as backward, dysfunctional, extremist abusers, a story in which the protagonist must reject his identity and religion to find any semblance of redemption. I gave this story two stars because it was written well, for what it was, making for a fast and, at times, gripping read.

Boy struggles with conflicting value systems of an ancient religion and a modern American lifestyle. Boy undergoes various family or other personal conflicts to emerge with less-naive but still deeply personal connection to cultural heritage and defines his own relationship to his faith (perhaps influenced by a 1990's America obsessed with independence of spirit.) We all feel better, learn something, and feel more tolerant of Islam provided that the practice of it is peaceful and benevolent, which at least some characters in the book prove to us that it can be. That's not what this book is. Instead, it is a harrowing account, somewhat carelessly and superficially written, of one boy's formative encounters with the best and worst that his religion has to offer. No punches pulled, sometimes quite literally. Roughly estimating, the pure, supportive, centering, joyful, and uplifting experiences of the narrator make up about 5%. The rest is pain and fear, both sublimated and openly expressed, displayed in the wide variety of ways that we as humans are so talented at accessing, so we are treated to needless repression and self-sacrifice, shouted hatred and incitement to violence, and everything in between. Ultimately, there is no portion of Hayat's religious experience that is untainted by wretchedness, and he escapes from it all in his young adulthood that makes readers feel grateful that the cycle will at least not repeat itself. This book neither challenged nor provided shades of color to my existing opinions about religion and how individuals use it to gain power over one another. I'm already a confirmed skeptic of organized religion, particularly the monotheistic faiths. I think that whoever invented the idea of hell has a lot to answer for. Those of us lucky enough never to have felt the dread of that eternal punishment are given the tourist's view of it here through Hayat's experience. What I found far more interesting than Hayat's motivation to avoid hellfire is his slowly unfolding understanding of Mina's core beliefs, since they clearly transcend Islam. Mina is inspired by Islamic texts and stories, teaching Hayat to interpret them with a focus on love, forgiveness, and good intentions. Her method of prayer is so close to mindful meditation that she might almost be referencing the yoga sutras of Patanjali. Unfortunately, Mina does not engage with Hayat about any of the violent or oppressive passages of the Koran. He is left to discover those on his own and hear them interpreted by others. How convenient for the novel that this is so. Akhtar gets quite a bit of extra pain by deciding that Hayat will not read the entire Quran and think about it, but instead will focus on memorizing it slowly so that he can become hafiz, thus ensuring a place for both himself and his parents in heaven. What a wasted opportunity for a deeper discussion. I wanted to hear him ask Mina about the fourth surah, which exhorts men to beat their wives if they do not obey, and the other passages with which he struggles as he encounters them in less thoughtful circumstances. Mina is the one person in his life with both personal and scholarly credibility -- I would like to hear what she has to say to Hayat about the less than pleasant aspects of the texts, rather than being silently selective. Instead, here is a fair reading of the overall arc of the novel: Hayat was untroubled by religious anxiety before Mina's arrival, since both of his parents had, to different degrees, shrugged off their religion. Mina then indoctrinates him with the Quran and her own joyful approach to spirituality, and leaves him unprepared for the moral quandaries to follow. No one picks up the slack to teach Hayat anything about his own sexuality, his place in society, or how to be a good and thoughtful person. He hears plenty about what NOT to do, and combining these excoriations with the impossible ideal Mina has set leaves him incapable of handling the inevitable cognitive dissonance which follows. Bad things happen. Gosh, if only Mina had not given him that Quran in the first place, what traumas might have been avoided? I find that story disappointing, and that is one reason that I am rating this as mediocre. The remaining reasons are the flat writing style (I felt this, he did that), the unconvincing voice of the ten-year-old narrator, and the lazy lapses in first-person focus when convenient for the author. The characterization is adequate but not memorable. Every character is flawed, and all of those flaws are laid out clearly for the reader to inspect. Meanwhile, none of the individual characters are perceptive enough to understand each other very well, so readers feel superior to the entire bunch. Overall, I am glad this book was not what I was expecting, as that would have bored me. The surprise here is that the author reveals so much of the very real negative aspects of a religion without apologizing for it or feeling the need to redeem it. I did, however, strongly wish for better writing and a few more deep conversations about faith, so that the book might linger longer in my thoughts."}, {"userName": "Laura Leaney", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3633494-laura-leaney", "userReview": "This is a tough book for me to review. Although the story is a fine one, the writing isn\u2019t artful or fresh enough for my taste. For most of the book I felt mired in stereotypes, although the generalities (Jews are smart and sensitive, Muslim men are narrow and patriarchal, women are hysterical and shrewish) are mouthed by the characters, not the author, I can\u2019t help but feel that the book is too much surface and not enough depth. The story is told by Hayat Shah, a Pakistani-American, remembering the time he told his future college girlfriend, the Jewish Rachel, about his childhood. And it\u2019s a tormented childhood, because Hayat is turned on to the Quran by his \u201cAunt\u201d Mina while his secular doctor-father adamantly opposes his son\u2019s new obsession and burns Hayat\u2019s Quran in the backyard. Some of the scenes are painful to read; there\u2019s so much at stake (marriages, honor, safety, reputation) \u2013 and the conflicts are not completely resolvable. Much of religious life, it seems to me, depends upon a person\u2019s ability to accept paradox and ambiguity. If you embrace The Word literally (either the Bible or the Quran or the Upanishads or the Guru Granth Sahib Ji or the Torah or the Yasna\u2026\u2026\u2026) then you\u2019ve got to be able to reconcile the ancient intolerances with what modern culture expects or what your heart knows is truer. This is the idea that I think Ayad Akhtarv depicts, and his Muslim characters suffer additional hardship in trying to maintain this ancient faith in America. Hayat Shah\u2019s boyhood study of the Quran begins simply as an attempt to secure the love of his beautiful and pious Aunt Mina. Along the way, he experiences moments of true spirituality (and many of the Quran\u2019s verses are very beautiful) but between his scoffing father and his bitter, Freud loving mother, he gets completely fucked up. The narrow-minded and hypocritical members of the community intensify this effect during his most sensitive pre-adolescent years.I have no doubt that Akhtar must have offended more than a few believers with his portrayal of devout American Muslims.

Ayad Akhtar writes compellingly with a great talent for pulling the reader into the story with characters so realistic and imperfectly flawed that we feel an intimate knowledge of each person therein. American Dervish is the story of a Muslim family in America, with a great deal of reference to the Quran, the teachings of the Muslim religion and how time and maturity and experience can change how one interprets anything, including religious texts. There are a great number of trials, even amongst the community of fellow Muslims, and their perceptions of one another are often a source of contention amongst themselves. There are characters we come to admire, to empathize with, and others we loathe. That's how well developed they are. In saying all this, how wonderfully planned and executed this entire book is, there are portions I take exception to. In my personal opinion, American Dervish would have been much better without all the graphic sexual details! It deterred from the story that up to that point I had been enjoying. That being said, American Dervish enables an understanding of the difficult transition it can be for those of other faiths and/or cultures to acclimatize to an entirely new life.

Then Mina arrives, and everything changes.Mina is Hayat's mother's oldest friend from Pakistan. She is independent, beautiful and intelligent, and arrives on the Shah's doorstep when her disastrous marriage in Pakistan disintegrates. Even Hayat's skeptical father can't deny the liveliness and happiness that accompanies Mina into their home. Her deep spirituality brings the family's Muslim faith to life in a way that resonates with Hayat as nothing has before. Studying the Quran by Mina's side and basking in the glow of her attention, he feels an entirely new purpose mingled with a growing infatuation for his teacher.When Mina meets and begins dating a man, Hayat is confused by his feelings of betrayal. His growing passions, both spiritual and romantic, force him to question all that he has come to believe is true. Just as Mina finds happiness, Hayat is compelled to act -- with devastating consequences for all those he loves most.American Dervish is a brilliantly written, nuanced, and emotionally forceful look inside the interplay of religion and modern life.
