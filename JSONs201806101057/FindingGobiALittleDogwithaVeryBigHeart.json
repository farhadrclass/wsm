The story begins when Dion Leonard takes a trip to China from Edinburgh to participate in a grueling 150 mile six-day seven-stage race in the excruciating heat of desert and dangerous mountain terrain.....\"the biggest race of his short running career.\" That unforgiving land is where Gobi appears out of the blue, looks Dion in the eyes and adopts him as her own....so cool.The first half of the novel is pretty much dedicated to the race itself (quite interesting), its participants, and how winning is not always the main goal....surprising and gratifying to hear....and Yikes! What an accomplishment to just finish....in any position!The second half explores the people of China, an adventurous, big spirited and loving little dog and the man who makes it his mission in life to bring her home....despite the many roadblocks....despite the frightening situations; and Wow! the support from SO MANY kindhearted people in the world that made it possible.\n(would be interesting to find out what REALLY happened to Gobi during her mysterious absence....don't you think?)\nMany thanks to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the complimentary ebook in exchange for review.

As he ran each leg of the race, the dog kept pace with him. At one stage they crossed a water course, and when she called to him from the bank, Dion turned and picked her up, carrying her across. When it was obvious the little dog would remain by his side, he named her Gobi \u2013 her courage and tenacity was outstanding. She cemented her place in his heart; it was a special friendship.When Dion and his wife Lucja were working out how to get Gobi home to Scotland, she went missing from the city of Urumqi in China. As Dion and the volunteers searched for Gobi, he wondered how he would ever find her \u2013 the city was home to thousands of stray dogs; how to find one in the maze of the rest? But help came from everywhere \u2013 international media, the internet and even the locals were caught up in the story of the missing Gobi. Would Dion be reunited with the extraordinary little dog who had adopted him as he ran across the sands of the Gobi Desert?Finding Gobi is a wonderful, heartwarming story written by Aussie ultramarathon runner and author Dion Leonard. I flew through the story in a matter of hours; beautifully written, filled with heartfelt emotion and always the little dog who takes everyone\u2019s hearts. An amazing true story about an incredible journey, and one I highly recommend.

Most people who follow my reviews soon realize I read A LOT of animal memoir books. As soon as one becomes available, I must have it! They almost never fail to disappoint, and this one was no exception.Dion Leonard is an extreme runner, after taking up the sport because his girlfriend/wife became interested in running as a sport and encouraged him to join her. Not one to take things by halves, Dion found himself competing at an elite level, racing some top notch runners across harsh terrain and extreme temperatures. Along the way a little dog whom Dion called Gobi appeared beside him, and this book is not just the race, but the race to get Gobi back to the UK to join Dion and his family.I love animals, and therefore I love animal books, especially if they have a happy ending. I hope that Dion and Gobi get many happy years together, and I know Gobi will be much happier with a family as opposed to on the streets of China. Excellent, personal writing too, Dion isn't afraid of confronting some personal demons.

In the desert the daytime temperatures got up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit or even higher so its a real test of endurance. On this race he encountered a little brown dog that seemed to latch onto him. The dog ran with Leonard for three of the stages, a distance of 77 miles. Think of those little legs going like the clappers! They named her Gobi because of where she was found. Leonard ran the longest and hottest stages without the dog because he thought the conditions would be too extreme for her so she was driven to the end of those stages. Nevertheless he missed the company and inspiration of his new little friend. After the race he vowed to do whatever it took to enable Gobi to come home to Edinburgh with him.If he thought the ultra marathons were epic, they were nothing compared to the bureaucratic and logistical difficulties in getting one little dog from China to the UK. They finally did it but it was a long and difficult road. Along the way Leonard met some wonderful people and made some amazing new friends. The help of strangers and the worldwide response to Gobi's plight blew him away. In these times of news about atrocities and hate and war it is refreshing to be reminded that the human spirit is indeed alive and well and that we have more in common with our fellow humans that we have differences.If you need to pick yourself up or just want a 'feel good' book, read this and smile!"}, {"userName": "MaryG2E", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20933650-maryg2e", "userReview": "5\u2605sEx-pat Australian Dion Leonard is an ultra marathon runner, who takes part in 5 day races staged in extreme settings. Like the Sahara, Kalahari and Gobi Deserts. Early in the 2016 event his path crosses that of a cute, skinny little terrier, who then follows him through exceptionally harsh conditions. He names the appealing little stray \u2018Gobi\u2019 after the region in which he is competing. By the end of the race, he has decided that he will do his best to adopt Gobi and take her home to Edinburgh. He had no idea just how difficult that challenge would turn out to be. In the ensuing days, left in the care of a local family, Gobi goes missing in the remote city of Urumqi. Leonard begins a desperate search to find her somewhere in the enormous expanses of rural China.The story which unfolded after the race is fascinating, and Leonard\u2019s easy writing style kept me glued to the pages, as I was desperate to find out what happened to the stray dog. But this is a much more substantial story than that of a man and a dog. While the development of the bond between man and dog is central to the story, I was also greatly intrigued by the gradual revelations that Leonard makes about his own life, and the beliefs that drive him. Also fascinating is the insider information about the sometimes cut-throat world of competitive ultra-marathon racing. Leonard has a powerful competitive streak in his nature, something which drives him to push his body and mind to the utmost limits of existence. The book provided me with interesting insights into the mindset of an extreme sportsman, something that I genuinely appreciated. The reading experience is enhanced by a goodly number of appealing colour plates, and I was particularly drawn to the photos of Gobi, with her adorable doggy visage.\u201dWaiting around in the flat\u2026I thought about why finding Gobi had been so significant for me. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure it out. It was about keeping my promise.\u201cI\u2019d vowed to bring Gobi back, no matter what it took. Finding her, keeping her safe\u2026meant that I had kept my word. After all the ups and downs, I\u2019d been able to rescue her. I\u2019d given her the safety and security I had been so desperate for when my life went wrong as a kid.\u201dI really enjoyed this book, read it in one 6 hour sitting, and think it is a worthwhile read for anyone, not just dedicated dog owners like myself."}, {"userName": "Taylor B", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28409658-taylor-b", "userReview": "Having followed Dion and Gobi's story since it broke last year, when it was announced that there was going to be a book about their journey, I knew I had to read it.I will admit, I am not normally a fan of non-fiction books.

The book covers a wide timeline: from the author's troubled childhood in Australia - to becoming an ultra-marathon runner and living and training in Scotland - to his Gobi Desert race, and the adventures around the little dog he named Gobi. This book is a combination memoir and animal read. I loved the feel-good elements with Gobi, but it was also fascinating to get a peek into the crazy and grueling experience of ultra-marathon running. If you're like me, you'll be shaking your head with incredulity as you read the chapters on the desert race and learn of the extreme lengths these runners go, both physically and emotionally in attempting to complete these tortuous races. The story benefits greatly from Leonard's willingness to share his difficult experiences in childhood and his emotional journey to arrive at a place where this type of training and racing fulfills an important need for him. And it makes the bonding of Gobi and Leonard that much more special.An endearing read for animal lovers, athletes, or anyone enjoying an inspiring tale of overcoming challenges, finding your zone in sport and in life, and opening yourself up to special connections!Check out the physical book for pictures!! I read this in paperback, and there were some wonderful color pictures in the middle that brought the story alive, pictures of his childhood, of racing, and of course Gobi! You can also search the internet to see lots more adorable pictures of the adorable Gobi, and there are some great interviews with the author both on radio/audio and tv/video.I originally got this book from the library, but I'm planning to buy a copy so I can read it again, as it's such an inspiring and feel-good tale that never grows old, and the pictures are great to look at."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/671638-sharon", "userReview": "I find a book like this tough to rate, because the rating is more reflective of the subject material, which I was drawn to, rather than the actual narrative or writing. Did I love reading about little Gobi and her indomitable warrior spirit? Absolutely. The passages describing her latching on to ultra marathon runner Dion Leonard, ultimately following him 77 of the 155-mile desert run across the Gobi desert, put an ear to ear grin on my face and warmed my heart. It's the reason I picked up this book.Did I enjoy the descriptions of Dion's foray into competitive running and ultra-running? Absolutely. (His training sounds almost as intense as my 5k prep.) I liked some of the juicy gossip he included about the actual Gobi Desert Race (including throwing fellow runner Tommy Chen completely under the bus, basically saying he cheated by bypassing some markers; and that one of the reasons Dion lost was to help care for Chen when he suffered from heat exhaustion). I also liked the passages about ultra marathon running legend Cliff Young, who at the age of 61, ambled up to the starting line in Sydney and proceeded to run for five days straight to Melbourne, whooping the collective ass of runners half his age.Weaknesses included a few too many passages about Dion's upbringing and contentious relationship with his mother--it just felt unrelated, forced, and bitter. In the end, I just didn't find Leonard very likable. His devotion to running, his drive, and his love of Gobi were all beyond admirable, but his [brutal] honesty grated.Guys, on a somewhat related note: I picked this book up as extra motivation for my first real deal 5k on Saturday! Never in a million years did I ever think I could run (I've been a long sufferer of shin splints). Earlier this year, I completed my first mile, and It was honestly one of the proudest moments of my life. Earlier this evening, I did a comfortable 4.5 mile jog.

I love the cover. This was a sweet story about a how a dog wiggled his way into the heart of a passing by runner and then into the hearts of many across the world. I loved that part of this story. It is a feel-good, do-the-right-thing kind of story. The runner, Dion, eventually becomes Gobi's owner, after many hoops to jump through. The one thing that seemed off was that it felt 'overthought' at times. One example is when it comes to Gobi's story, the question of foul play or paranoia was so incredibly vague with no resolution or facts. I wondered if it was just mentioned for a dramatic effect or what. I, too, can go to worst case scenario in .03 seconds with no factual basis....just ask my kids.

Dions laatste race door de Gobiwoestijn in China pakte heel bijzonder uit: hij raakte verslingerd aan een zwerfhondje (dat later Gobi is gedoopt) dat hem de hele week volgde en dat hun beider levens voorgoed veranderde. In mijn reis met Gobi vertelt Leonard over zijn moeilijke jeugd, over zijn fascinatie voor extreme sporten en over wat zijn vriendschap met Gobi voor hem betekent. Dit boek leest vlot weg.

China to many is a bit of a mystery but this book certainly gives you a good glimpse of life there.\u00a0The book is easy to read and I could not put it down. \u00a0It's a story that will suit everyone whether you are familiar with Gobi or not, it will inspire and uplift you. \u00a0It is truly heart warming."}, {"userName": "Rowan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35794399-rowan", "userReview": "Confession: I couldn\u2019t say no to the cute little face staring at me from the front cover. It seems I was drawn to Gobi in much the same way author, Dion Leonard, was drawn to becoming her owner!Dion uses a combination of flashbacks to his childhood and earlier life, while also following his ultra-marathon race in which life changed forever by meeting Gobi. Usually I don\u2019t like such uses of flashbacks, but Dion does this effortlessly in a way that always maintains a natural flow to the book.The laughs and smiles began happening the moment Gobi appears in the book around page 40. It causes the book to go from so-so story about a runner, to can\u2019t-put-down story about a runner and an amazing, inspirational little dog.Dion writes in a way that made me feel like I was running alongside him and Gobi through the tough terrain \u2013 thankfully all without the physical effects of running a marathon itself! Gobi is truly an inspirational little dog and it\u2019s beautiful reading of the bond which forms during the ultra-marathon. Gobi breezes through insane running distances that would leave most of us collapsed in a heap! Her toughness and resilience for such a little animal reminded me of my own brave little dogs over the years.Split into chapters and six parts, it\u2019s an easy-to-read book. Once you slip into the rhythm of it, you fly through it \u2013 much like Dion and his marathons! It\u2019s a great book for all ages in which numerous lessons about resilience, friendship, courage and humility are shared.I never expected a story about a dog to transcend into something resembling that of a Cold War thriller \u2013 but it does. Dog-nappers, grey saloons, strange men in suits \u2013 they all make appearances in the latter half of the book which make it unexpectedly gripping stuff!It was also interesting about how Gobi\u2019s story went viral courtesy of the crowd-funding campaign Dion started to help get her to the UK. More heartbreaking was China\u2019s attitude and abhorrent treatment of dogs and animals in general. Get your act together China!Dion does go off on occasional irrelevant running tangents \u2013 if the race doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Gobi or the overall story, why mention it? I found it slightly poor taste to just leave Gobi with a carer (straight after desperately trying to reunite with her) so he can enter a race or two.One thing is for sure, Gobi brings smiles to faces worldwide, through her resilience and attitude to life. Through finding Gobi, Dion found himself. Finding Gobi is an inspirational book about never giving up or letting the negative voices inside your head win.\u201cIn a year marked by grief and fear, Gobi\u2019s story was a beacon of light\u201d.Yes.

The story that lies just underneath the amazing feat of a small dog running 77 plus miles across the desert to stay with the gruff and focused ultra-runner, is the back story gently and quietly weaved in underneath.

I knew I didn't belong among them.\" How he was able to move beyond the small town mentality, move countries, fall in love, and become a man who took better care of a small dog that followed him on a brutal race-trail, then he seemed to ever have been cared for himself by his own mother and father.He watched the man he believed to be his father die, he found out through an off-hand comment from his seemingly mentally-ill mom that the man he loved as his father wasn't indeed his dad, his mom seemed to have went bonkers, she banned him to the unfinished basement and would lock him down there when he was home, his town shunned him, even the church wasn't a refuge. These snippets seemingly scattered in lightly in the story landed like artillery in my heart. \"But I knew it was just another uncomfortable set of feelings to get through. We'd all experienced far worse in the previous twenty-four hours, but the unknown is always more intimidating then the familiar.\"\"...my childhood contained some hardships, but it also gave me the tools I needed to survive. All that pain and loss gave me a certain kind of toughness.\"\"Anyplace can be alright,\" he'd say, \"as long as you accept what's wrong with it.\""}, {"userName": "Susan Maunz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24604112-susan-maunz", "userReview": "This is primarily about the author that is an excellent runner, not about Gobi."}, {"userName": "Lena", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena", "userReview": "\"Any dog that tough deserves a happy ending.\" \n After reading Craig & Fred I didn\u2019t think anything would be harder than getting a stray dog out of a war zone to the USA.

It was hard to read about how dogs are pariahs in China but the attention the search for Gobi received highlighted the efforts of Chinese animal welfare activists.

The lovable pup, who would later earn the name Gobi, proved that what she lacked in size, she more than made up for in heart, as she went step for step with Dion over the Tian Shan Mountains, across massive sand dunes, through yurt villages and the black sands of the Gobi Desert, keeping pace with him for 77 miles.As Dion witnessed the incredible determination and heart of this small animal, he found his own heart undergoing a change as well.\u00a0 Whereas in the past these races were all about winning and being the best, his goal now was to make sure he and Gobi\u2019s friendship continued well after the finish line.\u00a0 He found himself letting Gobi sleep in his tent at night, giving her food and water out of his own limited supply, and carrying her across numerous rivers, even when he knew it would mean putting him behind in the race, or worse, prevent him from finishing at all.\u00a0Although Dion did not cross the finish line first, he felt he had won something even greater \u2013 a new outlook on life and a new friend that he planned on bringing home as soon as arrangements were made.\u00a0 However, before he could take her home, Gobi went missing in the sprawling Chinese city where she was being kept.
