Anna doesn't pay Silas any attention and doesn't act like she cares that he likes her. Rachel has fallen in love with the sweet Silas and doesn't know if she should tell her sister how she feels or not. When Anna tells everyone a secret she has been keeping the Amish community is flipped upside down and so is Rachel and her family. Anna decides to leave her Amish faith behind after secretly getting married. Now forced with the harsh reality of Anna leaving, Rachel now is alone and beginning to think more and more about the man Anna left behind. I enjoyed this book and I thought the characters came together nicely. If yu enjoyed any others from the series then you will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Lin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19486733-lin", "userReview": "I found the book very well written, I really felt the emotions of the family members, not just the main character Rachel. The scene where she found her father took me right into Rachael's panic. The fact that Anna gave Rachel her hope chest when she left and Rachel didn't open it, showed how much Rachael was convinced Anna would change her mind. I love reading about such a pure why of living, the Amish have a special reverence for living the way we all should. The scene on the back porch with Rachel and Anna caught my heart with theirs."}, {"userName": "Janet C", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1352431-janet-c", "userReview": "#4 Brides of Lancaster. Enjoyed this 4 book series. Rachel Beachy has been in love with Silas for many years. Silas was in love with her older sister Anna. Anna decided to marry Reuban and they leave the Amish life. This book was interesting because it explores how the family feels when a child decides to embrace the English life. It also shows how generations leave legacy's by tying the 4th book with the first in the series.For thou art my hope, oh God: thou art my trust from my youth.

She jumped around between the family's, starting out with parents then a different child in one then a different child in another so I had to go back and get a small refresher but it was a good series.

But on the other hand, her sister Anna is very different. You could say, VERY different. Rachel is perfectly satisfied with the Amish way of life, but she has one problem. She is in love with her sister's boyfriend, Silas Swartley. While Anna doesn't seem to take a liking to the Amish way of life, even though she has been baptized into the Faith, she has little feelings for Silas! When Anna up and leaves the Amish Faith, Silas and the Beachy families are crushed. This does rekindle Rachel's hope, that maybe.... just maybe she might have a chance with Silas. But Silas can't look at Rachel as more than a child and the little sister of the woman he loves! Throughout the book 'The Hope Chest' can Silas see that Rachel has matured into a woman and will faithfully be a wonderful wife?  'The Hope Chest' was rich in detail and plot. I thought the story line was amazing, keeping me interested at every second. Wanda E. Brunstetter sure has a gift for writing! She inspires me to learn more about the Amish and their beliefs. I am sad to say, 'The Hope Chest' was the fourth and final book in the series 'Brides of Lancaster County,' but I am looking forward to reading other series of hers. I promise that this realistic fiction novel will not let you down! Give 'The Hope Chest' by Wanda E. Brunstetter a chance and you won't regret it!"}, {"userName": "Tasha enderby", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2052897-tasha-enderby", "userReview": "This book was not a thrilling read but it did have some of really good points. It's a book that contiually shows you that snooping and listening in on conversations does nothing but hurt your feelings. I think this is a lesson we all have trouble with because we just have to know what is being said exspecially if two people feel the need to have it in private. I know I am guilty of this one. Rebecca starts off by hiding in tree's listening to conversations from her older sister, the hiding behind doors to hear conversations between a boy she likes and his cousin, to hiding in closests to hear what her parents have to say about her sister who chooses to leave the faith. In each of these relationships she makes the choice to hinder them by her actions after hearing what was not meant for her to hear. Rebecca's journery to find hope in God and not in others or what she desires is a long one and the book does have a happy ending."}, {"userName": "Karen & Gerard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/979933-karen-gerard", "userReview": "I enjoyed The Hope Chest by Wanda E. Brunstetter about an Amish family whose eldest daughter left the faith to marry an Amish man who chose to leave the Amish community because he liked the modern things. An Amish man wanted to court her but she kept putting him off and encouraged him to court her younger sister instead who she felt was a better match for him. Her younger sister, Rachel, actually did hope to marry him some day. Of the three books in the \"Brides of Lancaster\" series, I liked this one best. There was the romance story line but also the story line about shunning the oldest daughter who married outside the community, leaving her Amish lifestyle behind. It wasn't as depressing as the others and I liked the main characters better in this one too. It's a light, quick read."}, {"userName": "Kaye", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401537-kaye", "userReview": "The fourth in a series of Amish romances. This book has a younger sister crushing on the boy who wants to court her older sister. When the older sister elopes with another Amish man who has decided to live English she hopes the attention of the boy will turn to her. These are simple stories, clean and faith promoting.
