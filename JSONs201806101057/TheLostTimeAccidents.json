If I told you that the problem with this story is an unbelievable central premise, you'd likely assume I was referring to the myriad time travel machinations. Not so. I'm a sucker for a time travel plot, and while not perfect, there was a studied, if slightly over-complicated mystery to this one, that could have flourished under different circumstances. However, more than a time travel story, this book is at heart a Chosen One narrative, and in the opinion of this reader, a Chosen One story will sink or swim on the shoulders of s/he who is chosen. And Waldemar Tolliver sinks this book. For most of the narrative, the entirety of his personality is shorthanded through casual sexism, archaic turns of phrase, and daddy issues. Admittedly from page 300 onwards, I was only half paying attention, but if he somehow became compelling in the book's 11th hour, I can safely decree: too little, too late. I would guess that mine will end up a minority opinion, because Wray is relying on his imagined (male) readership to fill out Waldemar's characterization through self-projection. Wray's ideal reader is a man who indulges equally in self-deprecation and delusions of grandeur, and I dare say he'll find enough. Personally, I'd stick this book on Rebecca Solnit's proposed list of \"50 books no woman should read.\" Female characters are relegated to catalysts or crones. There is one interesting thread buried in this mess of a book (which was why it took me so long to realize I was ultimately sick of it): the character of the narrator's grandfather Kaspar (tellingly not a Chosen One) and his wife Sonja kept me intrigued up until their pre-WWII flight from Austria. Kaspar is (not coincidentally) the most well-developed character and the only male character I would have enjoyed spending more time with. Sonja too gave glimpses of intrigue, but like the other women in this book, stayed a vague sketch and a prize and a catalyst."}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "The cover illustration nails a nifty visual of Wray\u2019s latest fiction--that time is not linear, but, rather, is rotary or circular, curved or spherical. Where did this come from, and why does it matter? It starts with Waldemar \u201cWaldy\u201d Tolliver, and the opening of this novel will likely go down as one of the greatest first lines of fiction:\u201cThis morning, at 08:47 EST, I woke up to find myself excused from time.\u201d Well, whose curiosity wouldn\u2019t be piqued? Its message is lean and straightforward, yet enigmatic. But, lest you think that this novel is lean and straightforward, think again! This is a fat, juicy, bulky, baggy, brainy, epic, and ginormous book, with Big Ideas and a sprawling cast. The narrative is approached as a letter to a Mrs. Havens, the object of Waldy\u2019s affections, and spans about 500 semi-dense pages and three generations. We are taken on a journey from Moravia, to Vienna, to NYC. Ottokar Toula, Waldy\u2019s Czech great-grandfather, had alighted upon a theory of time, or a Time Accident, which he was about to prove to the world in 1903, when he was run over by a Daimler. He left a cryptic and seemingly nonsensical note of sorts, which Ottokar\u2019s two sons try to decode. They become part of the fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna when they move there to attend university and try to solve their father\u2019s theory. Kaspar eventually seeks love and family matters, while Waldemar (Waldy\u2019s great uncle) becomes more obsessive about the Lost Time Accidents.What follows is a metaphysical romance, as well as a romance of metaphysics, reminding me sometimes of the mandala symbolism in GRAVITY\u2019S RAINBOW, the obsessive traits of scholars in THE DOUBTER\u2019S ALMANAC, the nature of time in Iain Pears\u2019 ARCADIA, and the influence of Kabbalah and the Tarot on the unconscious mind. While reading, I felt the resonance of the \u201ctotality of being\u201d and the abyss of complete nothingness, as well as the temporal relationships of Time and of the perception of time. As well as C*F*P*--Chance, Fate, and Providence.Through all of Wray\u2019s high-minded science and philosophy, he doesn\u2019t forget the reader, and occasionally, the lowbrow humor. There\u2019s Waldy\u2019s father, Orson Tolliver, a celebrity writer of science fiction porn, with titles like \u201cSalivation is Yours.\u201d And, in ways that parallel STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, Orson\u2019s inflammatory notoriety as a \u201cPrime Mover\u201d in the \u201cChurch of Synchronology\u201d\u2014obviously a sardonic riff on the Church of Scientology. And, at the center of it is Waldy, an offbeat and oddball romantic who kept me fastened to the humanity of this story. We care, immediately, urgently, and continuously, about Waldy\u2019s fate. His search for the Truth of Time is yet mirrored in the time of truth. And his adoration of Mrs. Havens is both his torch and his Sword of Damocles.Wray bestows a very human look at our universal concerns of love, legacy, guilt, fear, identity, and morality. Not to mention a very serious, poignant, and tragic circumstance of evil experimentation by Waldy\u2019s ancestor, who brutally tested his theories of the Lost Time Accidents on the Jews in death camps during WW II. I\u2019m Jewish, and grew up haunted by the Holocaust, but this harrowing aspect of the novel would horrify anyone reading this book.And then there is Waldy\u2019s strained relationship with both parents, and his inscrutable, eccentric aunts who live in a virtual flea market of an apartment in Spanish Harlem. That\u2019s the place where he is now, unable to get back in Time.If sometimes the ambitious narrative seems out of control, it isn\u2019t. The author has a design to all of it. I never got weary, until near the end, when I really, really, wanted a resolve, to reward my implacable loyalty to the bending, circular, spherical text. I needed an \u201corbituary!\u201d (I even allowed for poetic license when the author casually mentions a head shop in the Ringstrasse. Heady shops, certainly, but no bongs for sale in the Ring!) I admit to a certain slight droop in my bearing at the finish line, which may have been inevitable, but felt a slight bit derivative or too facile. But, it may be that I wanted what those three generations of Toulas wanted. And what was that?\u201c\u2026the notion that chronology is an illusion, if not a deliberate lie; that the steady, one-way current we seem to be suspended in is actually a jumble of spherical \u201cchronocosms\u201d that can be moved through in any direction, if some great force manages to knock one\u2019s consciousness out of its preconditioned circuit\u2014had grown progressively more elaborate, attaching itself to random scraps of knowledge in the course of its creator\u2019s wandering, like a peach pit rolled across a dirty floor.\u201dWray\u2019s imagery soars on every page, with fresh feeling, \u201cand the bubbling molasses of his prose,\u201d so much so that I wanted to underline about 900 passages. I enjoyed the journey more than the destination, perhaps. So, if the finale didn\u2019t exactly beat me to it-- well, as Chance, Fate, and Providence would have it, Time is on my side."}, {"userName": "Ioana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana", "userReview": "The Lost Time Accidents is not a flawless epic masterpiece (say, Bolano's \n2666\n), but it is an incredibly creative, penetrating, fun, well-written, thought-provoking 3-generational saga that defies genres or synopsis. I didn't love this (4/5), and the execution didn't always work terribly well (4/5), but, I'm going with 5 for Wray's sheer originality and ingenuity. Because what this book manages to do is somehow weave together questions about historical memory (i.e. how do we atone for the sins of our forbears? how are psychoses, beliefs, passions passed down through generations?), a challenge to Einstein's theory of relativity (!! synchronicity), a mind-bending structure that spirals inwards in time, a century's worth of events, and an intelligent, ingenious exploration of the ethics of science and of the nature of time. Above all, The Time Accidents is a story about time in all its dimensions: physical, experiential, historical, psychological, poetical, mathematical, etc. And who doesn't love/isn't intrigued/vexed/lost/beholden to/perplexed in/by time?!?! Time, the supposed 4th dimension, only moves in one direction (as we experience it). But, mathematically, if it is just another dimension, it should be traversable, like space (also, in physics, time is just another coordinate in the spacetime fabric). Physically, we're always in seemingly the same time. Yet time can pass slower or faster, depending on how we're feeling/what we are doing (same in physics, it turns out: the \"passing\" of time is related to an object's movement through space). If you think about time as coordinates (x,y,z,t), and take an object that is first located at coordinate A, and then at B, then time begins to look a lot like movement, the coordinate that describes motion. What does this even mean? I have no clear idea - it's virtually impossible, really, to capture time, though many have tried, in all disciplines. Then-what about dreams and memory? Memory can take us back in time. After all, isn't the world as we know it just our perception? And our memories are mental events, like anything else we process from experience. Is memory the ultimate time-travel? If so, what about historical memory? What about that which has been passed down through generations, what about concepts that have encrusted themselves with time that now seem \"given\", when in fact they are just artifacts of time and reenactment?The Time Accidents is one of those books that won't give you an answer (a definite plus from my perspective), but rather lead you in a journey of questions-not only those explicitly asked in the story, but also those the reader is inspired to imagine on their own. For me, this translated into a crazed book-buying binge about things like octopuses (they are radial creatures after all - how do they experience space, and thus time, since spacetime is one and the same). And, into furiously printing out a slew of articles about stuff like \"mathematical philosophy of time in Minkowskian space\" (I'm a math geek, as all math teachers should be). Your inspiration could take many other forms, depending on your interests - there's the Nazi question, the question about how science intersects with ethics, the question of familial guilt and psychosis, the question about the nature of dreams and memory, you name it, Wray's got you covered. The book is definitely an investment (of time, incidentally), a dense 500 pages. It's not perfect (for example, Wray's wittiness is at times self-conscious and somewhat awkward), but it's one of the most curiosity-inducing books I've ever read, and for that alone, I would HIGHLY recommend it!!"}, {"userName": "Oriana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana", "userReview": "From Flavorwire's \"50 Most Anticipated Books of 2016\" list: This big, multi-genre epic from the author of Lowboy and Canaan\u2019s Tongue considers the damage wrought by the 20th century alongside questions about the nature of time.

In Geneva, an obscure patent clerk was already working on something he called \"relativity\" (though he was not to have his own \"annus mirabilis\" until 1905). And in Znojmo, Czechoslovakia, Ottokar Gottfriedens Toula may or may not have written down the secret of time travel, just moments before dying in front of an inattentive Viennese burgher's shiny new Daimler.That kind of ignominiously thwarted potential might drive any surviving family members a little bit potty\u2014and Ottokar Toula's children, grandchildren and even great-grandchildren all come to terms with his \"Lost Time Accidents\" in their own decidedly... idiosyncratic ways.John Wray's novel The Lost Time Accidents begins lethargically, even claustrophobically. Waldemar Tolliver, Ottokar's thoroughly American great-grandson, has become trapped\u2014\"excused from time,\" as he puts it\u2014in a tiny furnished nook deep within a warren of accumulated trash stuffed into the New York City townhouse where his dotty aunts Gentian and Enzian lived and died. (This setting is almost certainly modeled after the real-life abode of the Collyer brothers, two wealthy hoarders who perished in their Harlem brownstone in 1947, by the way. The New York Daily News has an unforgettable photo gallery online as well.)Fortunately, Waldemar's narrative\u2014if not Waldy himself\u2014does swiftly emerge from its stifling cocoon to take in much more space, as well as time...I found it odd how closely The Lost Time Accidents dovetailed with the book I read just before this one, The Russian Debutante's Handbook. Both books have more than a soup\u00e7on of Holocaust history stirred in, and as both narrators shuttled back and forth from New York City to Eastern Europe, I saw many reflections\u2014or refractions, perhaps\u2014of Gary Shteyngart's perspective. And sexism... this sentence, for example, alliteration and all, could've come straight from Shteyngart:His sole source of solace was the waitress, a dumpling-cheeked Serb barely out of her teens, whose haunches shook like aspic as she crossed the gleaming floor.\u2014p.114The Lost Time Accidents is certainly not without other flaws. It's hard to write about crackpottery at length without starting to sound a little cracked yourself, I think, and all too often Waldemar Tolliver's narrative descends into rather turgid meandering. But the story does resist circularity\u2014it keeps moving forward, despite Waldy's oft-repeated purpose (repeated by others, anyway), to \"close the loop\" once and for all on the Lost Time Accidents.And, occasionally, John Wray's novel is even fun. Pretend that you've just picked up this book yourself and turned at random to page 279... I'm going to quote that one page (all three paragraphs of it), which I think performs the parallel goals of perfectly demonstrating the most entertaining essence of The Lost Time Accidents while remaining free (I hope) of significant spoilers. This is Waldemar, analyzing his father Orson's unique way of coping with the Toula family's collective obsession by writing reams of pornographic science fiction (what the novel calls, derisively, \"starporn\"):Countless critics have tried, in the three decades since, to account for the popularity The Excuse enjoyed in Aquarian-era America, in spite of its blundering plotline, its junior high symbolism, and a style that makes Arthur C. Clarke look like Arthur Miller. None have come anywhere close to succeeding, but all agree that the novel's last section, which is entirely taken up by Ozymandias's psychedelic vision of the future, must somehow be to blame. Such a degree of critical consensus (as any connoisseur of book reviews will tell you) is the rarest and most delicate of flowers; but in Orson's case the critics had their reasons. For one thing, the \"Revelations\" section\u2014as it's come to be known\u2014has a radically different tone than the rest of the book, as if the author were taking dictation; and for another thing, Mrs. Haven, a number of its predictions have come true.In spite of their almost incidental presence in his novels\u2014usually as hastily sketched backdrops to scenes of cybernetic debauchery\u2014my father's prognostications of the not-too-distant future emerged, even during his lifetime, as the engine-in-chief of his fame. The time-travel allegation\u2014the time-travel insinuation, better said\u2014had been leveled against my family before, to explain the Timekeeper's disappearing act at \u00c4schenwald; but the case against Orson Card Tolliver, especially since the invention of Global Positioning Systems and Viagra and the European Union (all of which he predicted) proved harder to sweep under the rug. The evidence, after all, is plain for anyone with a library card (or access to the World Wide Web\u2014which Orson also saw coming) to judge for themselves. It changed my father from a figurative \"cult novelist\" into a literal one, an actor on the klieg-lit stage of history, no matter how furiously he lobbied to prevent it.The orgy scene in \"How to Make Machines and Influence Your Wife,\" for example, is tame by today's standards (six-dimensional dildo notwithstanding), and its prose won't win any Nebula Awards; the wireless earpiece, however, so casually deposited on a night table as the frolicking begins, is noteworthy in a story written in 1963. Personal infrared goggles were undreamed-of in 1959, but they're standard issue on \"Planet Perinorium 13,\" and used to predictably lascivious ends. Orson had a rabid fantasy life, needless to say, and a commitment to reality negation possibly unsurpassed in human history, not to mention a lifetime subscription to Technology Today, but even I have a hard time explaining the appearance, 112 pages into Clocksuckers (1973), of a jihadist riding a Jet Ski.Heh... I also rather liked this acerbic observation, not related to Orson's fiction:\"There's always room for one more religion in this country, sweetheart.\" He caught her by the waist. \"That's why the devil made America so big.\"\u2014p.317I picked up John Wray's novel on a whim, really\u2014its lime-green spine was eye-catching, but I managed to pass it by more than once before succumbing to that lure. Once I had it in my hands, though, I stuck with it to the end. And, ultimately, I'm not sorry to have done so, if only because I was able to use The Lost Time Accidents to slow the passage of my own personal duration, for a little while, at least."}, {"userName": "Greg Zimmerman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41665-greg-zimmerman", "userReview": "(First appeared at http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.co...) Time isn't a straight arrow, nor is it a flat circle (sorry, McConaughey) \u2014 rather, the \"chronosphere\" is just that: a sphere we're all trapped in. But what if the sphere could be traversed, manipulated, emerged from? If the past is memories, the future is dreams, and the presents slowly recedes into the past only due to the passage of time, what if all it took to navigate within the chronosphere is the human mind, well trained? If this sounds like the stuff you and your buddies talked about at 3 am after getting high in your dorm room, that's nearly the exact effect of reading The Lost Time Accidents, John Wray's new crazy, smashingly smart novel. But this is also a really funny novel \u2014 stopping just short of zany, but often with one-liners and scenes worthy of more than just a snort.There are three stories at once. A guy named Waldy Tolliver is writing his family's history. He's been \"excused from time,\" meaning he's stuck at 8:47 EST in presumably near-present day. He doesn't know why or how, and neither do we. We just accept it. The second story is the history Waldy is writing, and this is the meat of the novel \u2014 his great-grandfather, Ottokar Toula, living in a small town in Moravia at the turn of the 20th century discovers the secret to the universe \u2014 the Lost Time Accidents \u2014 but before he can tell anyone, he's hit by a car and dies. His two sons, one evil (Waldemar, for whom our stuck-in-time-biographer) is named, one good, Kaspar, both spend their lives in dramatically different ways trying to discover what their father had figured out. The story moves through the generations of the family, to Kaspar's son, Orson. Orson has a different relationship with family legacy, deciding to forgo physics to instead to write low-grade sci-fi. The ideas in one of his novels accidentally launches a Scientology-like cult called the United Church of Synchronology. Finally, the third story is our narrator/biographer telling us the story about how he met a beautiful woman named Hildegard Haven at a party before he got stuck in time. He then proceeds to carry on a scandalous (Mrs. Haven is married after all), wild romance with her, leading up to his becoming stuck in time.Naturally, all the stories converge (to a singularity?) and I was riveted in the second half of this novel to see how it'd all work out, to see if the various characters would truly solve the mystery of the Lost Time Accidents (if there actually is a definitive solution). From how to deal with the \"grandmother paradox\" (if you travel back in time and kill your grandmother, don't you cease to exist? But then how could you have traveled back in time to kill your grandmother? You don't exist!) to the \"Patent Clerk\" (Einstein, but the family hates him, because he just barely beat them to discovering relativity) and dozens of other head-trippy ideas in between, this is a novel that is a refreshing, inventive new take on the tried-and-true time-travel novel.If you're a fan of David Mitchell's head-warping stories, you likely won't be disappointed here. Despite the length, and some sagging of interest in the first half, this is a terrific novel if you're in to stories that are more than just a bit out there."}, {"userName": "Louise Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42343152-louise-wilson", "userReview": "What a hard slog I found this novel to be.The storyline is narrated by the youngest member of the family..

His clothes, once gray, were slightly singed and bleached in intermittent patterns, and the same was true of his facial follicles. In his shaking hand he held what appeared to be some kind of blue metallic pickle.I blinked (a monumental effort considering my corporal status), but the curious Gandalfic apparition didn't move, other than the steady chest-heaving of intense physical exertion. The tip of his hat let off a small bit of steam.\"Where did you come from?\" I asked, flabbergasted for the first time in my considerable duration.Gandalf the no-longer-Gray looked up at me gravely. \"Everywhen.\"He went on to explain that during the course of his battle with the Balrog at the bridge of Khazad-D\u00fbm, he and his nemesis suffered an unfortunately prolongated fall, but as he whizzed through the air, he noticed and reflexively grabbed a shiny blue object lodged in a small recess in the crag. He brought it to his mouth \u2013 not of his own accord, mind you; the Balrog slammed into him \u2013 and then suddenly they found themselves on top of a snowy mountain near the Pass of Caradhras. They did battle, leaping randomly through interdimensional timestreams with the aid of the space pickle (although he insisted on the use of the phrase \"pan-dimensional transfer voucher\"), for hundreds of years, until Gandalf ultimately conquered his foe by leaving him stranded in the primordial muck of pre-Mordor. \"And then,\" he gasped, clutching his sides, \"I teleported involuntarily throughout the entirety of the cosmos \u2013 even through a previously unknown terrifying placed called Detroit \u2013 until I ended up here.

This one is pretty clever: the main character, Walter, wakes up removed from time and starts writing a memoir. The book skips back and forth through time - he details his family history starting with his great grandfather, as well as his relationship with the mysterious Mrs. Haven, to whom the novel is written.There was a lot going on here. His entire family is afflicted by the syndrome, that is, an obsession with the \"Lost Time Accidents\", a concept created by his great grandfather shortly prior to his death. His great uncle was a nazi who performed unspeakable acts in the name of science; his father wrote a book which inadvertantly started a cult. The way the stories intertwine reminds me a little of Stephenson, although this one didn't come together for me as well as Stephenson's books usually do. Something like half of the book is written in the second person, letters Walter writes to Mrs. Haven. Sometimes second person doesn't work well in things like this - because we start the book after all of the action has taken place, Walter has to fill us in on everything that has happened to him. Practically, this means that he's filling in Mrs. Haven on a bunch of events that she was present for. In general, though, I thought that it worked in this book.I'm not sure how I feel about the uncle-Waldemar-was-a-nazi plot. For a minute, it seemed like Walter's ultimate struggle was going to be coping with his family's dark history, and I was all about that. How do you reckon with a past that you weren't privy to, but which irrevocably changed the world? That's such an important question. When the people who partook in monstrous acts are dead and gone, whose responsibility is it to make reparations? You are not going to find out in this book, which approaches the issue pretty directly and then takes a sharp left turn and completely ignores it. Had the book really examined any of those questions, I would have been fine with the inclusion of a Nazi main character. As it was, the whole Nazi thing felt a little bit lazy, short hand for \"this guy is a BAD GUY\" without any of the work to make us see that he really was a bad guy. The holocaust felt incidental to this book, which is really not appropriate.I did enjoy the ultimate uncertainty of time travel. There are several characters who supposedly travel through time over the course of the novel, but it's unclear whether they're actually travelling through time or whether they're all a bit insane. (To be fair, they definitely are a bit insane - and I feel like the book handles this well. It's presented as the character's reaction to living in a world which does not agree with them, rather than as something that is inherently wrong with them.) The novel leans heavily toward the idea that the time travel is real, but Walter is anything but a reliable narrator and there are a lot of ways that you can interpret this.A couple pieces of miscellany: Walter's dad, the sci-fi author, is called Orson Card Tolliver. I cannot imagine that this isn't some kind of shout out to Orson Scott Card but... why? I cannot figure out any way that this is significant, but if there's no reason then why is it here?? There was also a section written from the point of view of Joan Didion that I couldn't really wrap my had around. To be fair, I haven't read Joan Didion and I don't know much about her, but it just seemed so confusing and out of nowhere... I didn't really know what to do with it.Overall I enjoyed this, just not quite as much as I expected to. The writing was on point and the characters were fascinating; the plot just didn't blow my mind the way that I wanted it to."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1608649-laurie", "userReview": "As other readers have commented, this book does begin with what may be the greatest first line: \"This morning, at 08:47 EST, I woke up to find myself excused from time.\u201d The novel starts with Waldemar \u201cWaldy\u201d Tolliver, a strange name for a strange man with a stranger family, going back four generations and whom have all been affected by the \"syndrome, an obsession with time and the belief that it travels in circles rather than a straight line. They believe one can therefore \"chrononavigate\"the past, present, and future, if only one can be \"shocked,\" if you will, out of the false mental construct of linear time. If this sounds weird, that is only further compounded by the second-person narrative to a woman named \"Mrs. Haven,\" who's intimate connection to Waldy is only revealed way into the second half of the book. This is intermixed with other odd (and possibly gimmicky) literary stunts, such as Joan Didion stepping in as narrator to provide her own perspective on one of the many crazy events in the book, such as Waldy's older twin sisters' dinner parties, including guests such as Joan herself, Picasso, and other famous personages, dead or alive. The complications of the plot run suspiciously in circles, sometimes getting bogged down in places where it was just spinning too fast and too strange to keep a pace. Still, the book kept this reader on tenterhooks and waiting to find out if Waldy and his family were seriously mentally ill or actually on to something. This book is hard to review. It is deeply weird, and the writing while often brilliant was also unsettling and confusing. There were more moments than I would've liked in which I felt I had to sit back and recalibrate my mind just to try and keep track of all the various characters and where they were in time and in relation to the main character. I also was a little let down by the ending, although I'm unsure what else he could've done to wrap it up. I will give him credit for coming \"full circle.\" This all said, despite being overly ambitious and circuitous, it was ultimately a unique and compelling love story with a time-travel twist--maybe.

The narrator is the great-grandson of the discoverer, who is called Waldemar, after his crazy grand-uncle who happened to be a horrible Nazi; someone who tried to further the research into time-travel by using Jewish prisoners at the concentration camp he headed. The narrator has the onus of not only proving the time travel thing, but also of somehow compensating for the misdeeds of his grand-uncle. The book is told in the form of a letter, the narrator stuck in a weird zone where time does not pass. I mean, he had enough to deal with what with his insane family (even without the grand-uncle, no one else is really sane), and no one would blame him for checking out of the time stream. But, the reason he's out of it is because he's in love with a mystery woman who is also married to a man who wants the secret of time travel. Our hero decides to write down a history of his family as a means to bring back his lover (I'm not sure why he thought it wouldn't send her running in the opposite direction screaming, but anyway). It was interesting enough, but went on longer than it should have. It's also not a time travel book, the time travel is only a device for the study of a dysfunctional family, and Holocaust is also in the picture. It made me uncomfortable, a little, because I thought, towards the end, Waldemar the elder was portrayed as sympathetic. I'm not sure if that was intentional or I was projecting. Either way, it was uncomfortable reading. I didn't understand some threads of the plot at all (that of Julia and her motivations), but I also wasn't paying very close attention. At the end of it, I was glad I had read it, but I was also glad it was over."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3679784-drew", "userReview": "5+ out of 5. One of the great joys of my reading year, actually: it's a perfectly constructed novel, one that rewards taking your time with it and allowing the size and scope to hit you as they will. It takes a moment to push through the barrier in the beginning, I'll admit - but once you're in, it's a delightful ride. Wray brings speculative influences together with real-world politics (both global and familial) and honest highbrow literature to create something that I think Kurt Vonnegut would've liked to read. In a time when we need writers who have a little twinkle in their eye and who are capable of delivering works that are complex without being confusing, deeply emotional without being manipulative, and easy-reading without being breezy, I'm glad we have someone like John Wray.

The story begins at the turn of the 19th Century in Central Europe and continues to present day Manhattan with a pit stop during the Holocaust. There's a lot going on in this hefty book and I loved it for the most part. I'm not a student of physics so when the nitty gritty details of various theories was discussed I was somewhat \"lost\" myself (LOL) but I could follow the narrative in a more abstract manner.

It is an impressive fictional trek through 20th Century European and American history, cloaked as a genre-bending cross between time-travel speculative fiction and film nourish crime thriller; a trek seen through the eyes of a family of liars, thieves and murderers, who regard a former Swiss patent clerk, one Albert Einstein, as their family's most despised enemy, believing that only they themselves, not Einstein, truly understand time and the known physical laws of the universe. Much of the family's saga is seen through the eyes of young Waldemar \"Waldy\" Tolliver via a series of letters to his lover Mrs. Haven, that other reviewers recognize as memorable love letters to the craft of writing fiction. Named for his wickedly brilliant grand uncle Waldemar Toula, Tolliver discovers that he has left the flow of time itself, set up in a different reality where time doesn't exist. In the course of trying to reconnect with time itself, Waldy Tolliver will take us on a mesmerizing trek through some of the dark corners and recesses of Central European history, especially in the years leading up to and during World War II, when his relative Waldemar Toula discovers how to jump back and forth through time, recreating the fatal discovery made by his father Ottokar in Znojmo, Moravia, near the dawn of the 20th Century. Miraculously, Wray has written a spellbinding work of fiction that delves deeply into history, philosophy and physics that may interest anyone who has enjoyed reading not only the writers I have cited, but also such eminent scientist authors as Brian Greene, Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, treating us to a riveting fictional celebration of the rise of modern physics. With \"The Lost TIme Accidents\", John Wray has written the most impressive melding of science and fiction I have read since James Morrow's vastly underrated \"Galapagos Regained\"; without question, Wray has written one of the most important American novels published not only this year, but maybe, in this decade, that, like Morrow's \"Galapagos Regained\", does a remarkable job in melding science with fiction."}, {"userName": "Gem BookEater", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29819129-gem-bookeater", "userReview": "John Wray\u2019s The Lost Time Accidents is an epic novel that follows the path of a the family of a man who seems to die just as he\u2019s discovered time-travel. The final piece of the puzzle is lost with him but his sons believe they can replicate his experiments and find the secret themselves.As the twentieth century develops and war breaks out in Europe one son leaves and travels to America, while his brother uses the prison camps to conduct more experiments.Their story, and that of the rest of the family is told in a letter written by the great grandson \u2018Waldy\u2019 Tolliver to his lost love. He has plenty of time to write this letter as he seems to have been exiled from the flow of time himself. Can he find his way back and unmake his romantic mistakes?Time travel will always be a popular narrative for novelists but this one is most inventive in its use. The past isn\u2019t explored by time travel but bought back to life through family stories of turn-of-the-century Viennese salons and how Einstein\u2019s radical new theory stole their thunder, and reminisces about the golden age of post-war pulp science fiction and how they accidentally inspired a modern religion.It isn\u2019t until the last eighth or so of the book that we discover if the Nazi Waldy is named after really did discover time travel or not, and what that could mean for the world.This is a big novel, but quite engrossing. It doesn\u2019t suffer from a lack of editing, every word is either necessary to the plot or necessary to its beauty.

This was interesting though. All the sci-fi bits were mind-numbingly boring to me (specifics of time travel, some kind of super-hyper-physics) but I loved the family history Waldy told. Starting with his great-grandfather Ottokar who was killed by a wristwatch carrying truck right after he had discovered the Lost Time Accidents--where time is a sphere, not linear--at the exact point in history that Einstein discovered his theory of relativity thus making him historically obsolete. Ottokar had two sons, Waldemar and Kaspar (Waldy's grandfather) and Kaspar has some daughters and a son, and then eventually we get to Waldy himself. I thought the whole subplot of Waldemar being a war criminal during Nazi Germany was endlessly fascinating (although failed to truly understand the connection between time travel and his crimes during the war) and Waldy's whole complex over being named for this man, his obvious daddy issues and the dynamic with his spectrum-y aunts was so interesting. I wish the whole book had been more devoted to the historical aspects and less to the time travel, but I guess that is the whole point. I just found myself not even trying to follow the complicated threads of explanation for how time travel works, how everything is related, etc. Also, I loved the fact that Waldy's dad is this hack sci-fi writer who writes these semi-pornographic pulpy pieces of dreck that are used to eventually found a Scientology-like cult-religion.

And it's not a time-travel book per se, it is more of a family saga about a family that has been obsessed with TIME for three generations.The Toula/Tolliver family has been searching for the missing pages of Ottokar Toula's \"formula\" for time travel which he entrusted to his mistress minutes before his death at the beginning of the twentieth century. The novel follows his brother, son and grandson as they search for the secret of the \"Accidents\". The novel is narrated by great-grandson, Waldy Tolliver, son of science fiction writer Orson Card Tolliver (who's name will not be lost on science fiction fans), as he recounts the family lore to his ex-mistress, \"Mrs. Haven\". How all these characters and time periods inter-connect is what is so much fun about this novel! You could even say that the novel actually DOES time-travel back and forth among the generations.I wouldn't be surprised if the book is full of allusions to science fiction/time travel that I missed, but I did recognize the similarity of Waldy's hoarding and reclusive twin aunts to the real-life Collyer brothers, and the allusion of having a science fiction writer (in this case inadvertently) begin a religion/cult (in this case called the United Church of Synchronology).I highly recommend this delightfully entertaining reading experience.

It's really just a multi-generational love story with a bunch of bad technobabble thrown in to dress it up as something more than it is. It's also pretty heavy-handed and repetitive on the metaphors and allegory. Everything is a winter pear and everyone drives a Daimler. I will give it credit that aside from the gripes above it is competently written and the characters at least are well fleshed out but it's often at the expense of the story being uninteresting. By a quarter of the way through it I was dreading listening to it more and I didn't really expect the story to pick up more or really even care if it did. And I still had 15 hours left to go! I also got the impression from other reviews that it doesn't improve or possess a mind boggling ending. The supposed cleverness of this book that other reviewers seem so keen on never surfaced for me and the story was not enough to carry it otherwise. In other words, it's really long, slow and boring and it doesn't seem to have enough redeeming qualities to make it worth the slog. Sorry. Were it shorter I may have toughed it out.

So unusual in fact that I am having difficulty finding anything to compare it to!It is a multi-generational novel tracking the varied and conflicting lives of the Tolliver family. Most of the characters are not likable and certainly don't like each other much. Their quest to solve a family secret, and possibly the answer to the question of time travel, has warped and possessed them. I most enjoyed the vivid descriptions of the aunts apartment in New York, essentially they are just hoarders, and, like all hoarders, have a complicated justification for their compulsive behaviour. At moments I was fully invested in this (the great-grandfathers story for example, and his affair with the butcher's wife) and at others I felt myself drifting, the psychoses of the characters just too alienating to get into.

Firstly, it took me ages to read, not because I wasn't enjoying it, but because it's intense.

Couple that with an intricate, cross-dimensional tale of 4 generations of an eccentric Eastern European family, and it's no surprise it wasn't exactly an \"easy\" read. Though I appreciated Wray's writing style, I think I ultimately found the plot a little too convoluted and confusing for me to fully enjoy. I'm not a scientist and found a lot of the scientific explanations and references a bit difficult to follow.
