QUITE a bit. I heard Helen Rappaport talk about the book on BBC radio and knew I had to read it, and I'm so glad I did. Let's use headings to sort out my thoughts about what I learned.Albert the King: I always thought of Albert as a bit of a second fiddle, but NO. Late in the book Rappaport makes the point that Albert's death probably saved Victoria as queen, because (since she was pregnant for much of their lives together) he basically took over all of the important work and let her sink into the role of gutes Weibchen (good little wifey) that she obviously relished. I'm guessing that Victoria LOVED being dominated by Albert with his strict principles and relentless pursuit of excellence (between them they made their eldest son and heir's childhood a living hell) and her attitude toward him seems to have been remarkably fawning for a woman who was quite the domineering Queenie when she was single. It's telling that her faithful servant of the post-Albert period, John Brown, was a similarly domineering figure (he called her 'wumman'. AHAHAHAHAHAHA)Passive-aggressive much? But on the other hand, Queen Vic appears to have taken her revenge against Albert being the boss of her by insisting that all the rooms be kept very cold with the windows open even though her poor dear husband was ever a-shiver and wore a wig at breakfast to keep his pate warm. And she treated all of his health problems as little sniffoos until it was TOO LATE. Did she have a...Death wish? Victoria was given to excessive mourning and a lugubrious interest in death. When her mother died she went completely off the deep end, to the point where Albert got on her case about self-indulgence etc. etc. Putting that side by side with the above point, I wonder: Did Queen Vic secretly WISH her husband dead so she could revel in widow's weeds forever without the inconvenience of the Man of the Palace putting his foot down against it?Malingering, tippling and spending money on statues; wouldn't YOU fire this woman? Mourning provided a perfect excuse for Queen Vic to do pretty much what she liked, which was essentially to stay on vacation forever. This caused some constitutional crises in a system where the monarch theoretically had her hand on the tiller of the realm; her ministers were supposed to consult her about all sorts of things but she was usually miles away in both physical and emotional terms. And she spent what today would probably be millions of public money putting up statues and other memorials to Albert against his express wishes (although this did give us the Albert Hall, where my first degree ceremony was held, the Natural History and Victoria & Albert museums where I spent many a happy hour as a student, and Imperial College where I was, for a brief but glorious moment, a TV presenter. So I pretty much owe the early 80s to Queen Vic's obsessions).A redemptive note: And somehow she got away with it all, eventually growing up a bit and emerging as everyone's favorite Queen Grandma. Except if you were one of her long-suffering children. If Rappaport shows redemption, it's in extremely summary form and I'm glad of it. Hooray for the one-sided argument!This is such a great story of nuttiness on the throne that I'd heartily recommend it to all Victoria fans, whether you agree with Rappaport's interpretation or not. At the least it'll give you something to rail against. Very nicely written, really quite short (248 pages of text plus a short discussion of Albert's symptoms) and, if these things matter to you, the US hardback edition is beeeeyooootifully bound and presented. I do love a hardback book that lays open obediently at your page wherever you are in the book, so my thanks go out to St. Martin's Press.Conclusion: what are you waiting for? Go read it and tell me what YOU think.Update: oooo forgot to mention that there's tons of interesting stuff about Victorian mourning customs in there for the history buffs and morbid people. 6/11/16: reread after a Facebook conversation started by Helen Rappaport (who is one of those very approachable writers on social media) reminded me that there's a TV series knocking around somewhere, must check it out. I enjoyed the book just as much the second time around, and found myself focusing a bit more on the hapless Bertie and Alix, as well as Queen Vic's daughter Alice, all victims of Victoria's moods and self-centeredness."}, {"userName": "Shawn Thrasher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2148308-shawn-thrasher", "userReview": "The meat of this book is in the title: Queen Victoria was obsessed with her husband Prince Albert when he was alive, and then became obsessed by and with his death. The subtitle though - \"the death that changed the British monarchy\" - that's where this book gets tricky (or I suppose if I'm following idiom here, vegetarian). I have no doubt that the queen's longest of mournings changed the British monarchy, but I'm not sure Rappaport proved that anywhere in her book. I do think the prince consort's death and Victoria's shutting herself away for so long had an affect on the monarchy; it probably weakened the power of the monarch considerably. Rappaport, though, doesn't really go there in any great detail. There is lots of hemming and hawing and grasping of hands and exasperation by Gladstone and ministers about the Queen spending so much time in Balmoral and Osborne and not enough time in London; there were calls for her abdication and the doing away with of the monarchy itself. I've read elsewhere that her behavior constitutionally eroded the power of the monarchy; and I think that's the path Rappaport could have explored. She did elude to the current monarch's sense of duty bearing the hallmarks of \"a tradition set by Prince Albert\" and also a snide aside about whether this tradition would survive beyond her reign (wait and see). Rappaport did a tremendous job on showing how the death changed a monarch without delving too deeply in how the monarchy was changed for the better or for the worse. I don't think this is a mere quibble, but I also don't think this should stop you from reading what is still a very good, well written book."}, {"userName": "Mary Ronan Drew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2986995-mary-ronan-drew", "userReview": "The brilliant Helen Rappaport has done it again, written a book about a subject we thought we knew all about and made it fresh and new and in this case mesmerizing. I knew Victoria wore black for the rest of her long life after Albert died, but I had no idea of her obsession with death and mourning etiquette. Nor was I aware that she was such a typical 19th century hysterical female. Nor did I realize the extent of her \"royal malingering,\" as one of her courtiers called her reluctance - her refusal - to perform most of her duties. She would regularly retreat to Balmoral, 600 miles from London, forcing her ministers to take a 24-hour train trip to get to her. It was also surprising to discover how fragile Albert's health was for most of his life and how he declined into his last illness for fully two years before his death in December of 1861. During this time Victoria, while focused on him to an unhealthy extent, dismissed his illness as hypochondria. Having hardly been ill more than once or twice in her life she nonetheless reclined into hypochondria herself after his death to avoid appearing in public.The overworked Albert was a remarkable figure and during his 20 years as Victoria's consort made an important contribution to English government and foreign affairs. He was a skilled musician and interested in the sciences. He was extremely well read and of course knew everyone who was anyone in Europe. (In fact, he and Victoria were related to most of them.)For a fine blog review by Elaine of Random Book and Opera Lover go here: http://randomjottings.typepad.com/ran...and for another, by dovegreyreader, go here: http://dovegreyreader.typepad.com/dov...This is a book for which I wish I had a sixth star; it's that good.2012 No 46"}, {"userName": "The Lit Bitch", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4537892-the-lit-bitch", "userReview": "The book was good, well researched, informative, and presented an interesting topic.

This is intended as a \"companion book\" to existing biographies of this mythical royal couple.As a fan of biographies, I am deeply much in love with books that explores the human side of its subject rather than just narrating the events that I could just simply read in free articles such as Wikipedia. This book offers way more than that. Its meticulous narration to detail about the progress of Prince Albert's illness (as if hour by hour, day by day, the author witnessed the events herself) until his death satisfied my hunger for \"extreme details\"For those of you who have read a biography of Queen Victoria, I am pretty sure that most of you have sparked an interest to what kind of person Prince Albert was so that a British queen would become so smitten by him in the most bizarre manner. Is he really that mythical, legendary Prince of every woman's dream?This book is divided into two parts. The first one is dedicated to Prince Albert, a brief look into his life and his eventual betrothal to Queen Victoria, his aspirations, sense of duty and his loyalty to his adopted country despite his unpopularity as a foreigner. The Second one is dedicated to Victoria, and the obsessive after-effects of the death of her husband caused to her.I love this book because it taps to sources that are usually overlooked, prompting you to deduce that the author really did her research and offered a very good attention to detail about the personal side of the queen and her sense of loss. This book shows how one should write an account: Full of humanity, passion, attention to detail, and presenting facts to questions that are sometimes been neglected by previous Biographers."}, {"userName": "Kate Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2472327-kate-lynn", "userReview": "This is actually the first non-fiction book I've read over Queen Victoria.

Victoria's great love for her consort, Prince Albert, has always been a source of fascination, and this book fleshes out their story.In a traditional Victorian era household, the man was in charge, but Victoria and Albert's relationship was made unique by her status as Queen. Denied a kingly title by convention, Albert was actually a quite active participant in Great Britain's government, and his ideas had a profound influence on his smitten wife. When Albert died unexpectedly at the age of 42, the Queen was left adrift. As expected of a woman during the time, she responded to her loss with frailty and confusion, but she was less able to fulfill her people's expectations of their monarch. She retreated into her grief and sorrow, and much of the work that Albert had done to bolster the couple's public image fell into disrepair. While some grief was understandable, even admirable, her failure to meet her public obligations was met with frustration and discontent.On the one side, I read this book with some anger towards Victoria. She was often stubborn and self deluding. She had lost a husband, but she still had much to live for, including several children and a country that needed her. Yet even as my anger built, I would sometimes stop and think how alone she must have felt. Because of her unique position in British society, there was no one who could speak to her as Albert had, and there was no one who could fully understand that predicament. It was obvious that Victoria faced some very real and debilitating depression, and reading her story made me exceedingly glad that I am not a member of any royal family.This was an interesting depiction of Victoria's life with, and later without, Albert, but I still found myself wanting just a little bit more. Although decades passed before Victoria joined Albert in the afterlife, the latter half of the book skips from decade to decade with some rapidity, and it never really touches on the final years of her reign. In fact, chronologically speaking, the last events described happen in 1878, over twenty years before Victoria's death. Although I realize this is the story of Victoria and Albert, not just the story of Victoria, I doubt she stopped thinking of her beloved husband near the end of her life, and I suspect that her own impending death must have brought him to mind. I wish I'd known more about how she spent her last years. I was also curious about the legacy that this relationship had on Great Britain and the monarchy, and I don't feel the author really spent enough time exploring that aspect of the events. I guess I'll just have to find another biography to fill in the gaps..."}, {"userName": "Carol Dixon-Smith", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4859076-carol-dixon-smith", "userReview": "Magnificent Obsession is a very readable and insightful account of the effects of Albert\u2019s death politically, socially, and culturally in the years that followed.

At first I didn't understand the title, but as the book ended, I completely got it. For a good part of the book it seems like the author was very pro-Albert and very anti-Victoria who really changed a great deal after she married Albert. At first she didn't want to get married right away because she enjoyed having the freedom and the power to herself. Still marriage to Albert was good for her and as most people know, it was a real love affair, at least from her point of view!Needless to say when people died in those days, folks took mourning to a whole new level, and Victoria seemed quite obsessed with it even before Alberta passed away. During her childhood she had not been close to her mother said she restricted herself much (it was a real fight for the throne after Princess Charlotte and her baby died -- the daughter-in-law of George III and heir), but in latter years they had become close. After marrying Albert, she very willingly let him take over much of the running of the country. Besides she was busy having babies and suffering from postpartum depression, not to mention having a female monarch was not the most popular thing during this time. She bought in to the sexual inferiority until after losing Albert. She went into SERIOUS mourning for him after he passed away in 1861 and this continued for nearly 10 years. The English people did not like this at all and thought she should abdicate (which she would never do for her son, Bertie soon to be Edward VII), but she did not want to rule either complaining that it was so much work and she was completely overwhelmed. Her children were intimidated by her and she would not listen to her ministers although some of them learned the kowtow to her quite effectively. After he passed away, Victoria spent the following decade having monuments and memorials erected for him that I believe many are still present to this day. After some time, John Brown became a very close friend and confident much to the dismay of her family and the English people. Still during this time she published her journals and had someone else write a book about Albert. These are available on Amazon although not in Kindle form and quite expensive. So after she finally got around the business of getting out among her people call she finally came into her own. The ironic thing is that if Albert had not passed away, it would have been an entirely different country although he was firmly dedicated to duty and country. At least the people came to appreciate what he did for them although it took them a long time to come around from their anti-German sentiments. The author has done unimaginable research, and I have learned a great deal from reading this book. I'm looking forward for my book club discussions next week and next month."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise", "userReview": "The book lives up to its title, by showing the grand scale of Victoria's obsession with Albert in life and in death. It does not live up to its subtitle. It tells how the monarchy was managed during and after Albert's life with Victoria, but does not discuss whether the monarchy, itself, was changed.Despite some kind words by the author, Victoria is shown to be stubborn and self-centered throughout. She seemed to need the status of her role but did not want its responsibility. Albert helped her to avoid this responsibility; She later used her mourning for Albert as an excuse to avoid it.Author, Helen Rappaport gives a good portrait of Albert. While Victoria smothered him with her needy affection, he may have seen his marriage as a career move. He does not seem to return her affection, in fact, he feels that one of his princely duties is improving his wife. Despite the image of a large, happy and wholesome family projected at the time, and through history, there is a fundamental dysfunction, and the eldest son bears the worst burden.Regarding the subtitle I was hoping this book would shed more light on the evolution of the constitutional monarchy. It would seem Victoria's seclusion created a vacuum which further strengthened parliament. I was hoping this book would have some discussion on this.There was a lot of text devoted to Albert's death and Bertie's illness. The state of the queen's seclusion, the reaction of her family, the public, the government, and her stubborn insistence on memorializing her deceased husband are given good coverage. John Brown and his influence on Victoria are discussed. The book ends abruptly with a discussion on the diagnosis and treatment of Albert, the state of medicine at the time, and today's opinions."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7837891-nancy", "userReview": "In life Victoria had a cloying love of Prince Albert. In death this turned into an overbearing and overriding obsession that dominated her monarchy and nearly ruined it. Queen Victoria\u2019s world came to an end on Dec. 14, 1861, when her husband, Albert, died supposedly of Typhoid fever. The book describes in detail all of the intimated details of Albert's untimely death. Victoria continued to mourn her husband's death in a consuming way until her death in 1901. Like many Victorians, Victoria had always been mesmerized by death. With her husband's death she now reveled in all of its rituals and forced her family and society to do likewise. For 10 years Victoria almost totally avoided the public eye. The public began to have a revulsion to a mourning that would never end. Victoria overbearing overriding obsession almost pulled her reign down. Ten years later in 1871, it was the near death of her son Edward (Bertie) which changed the the tide and got Victoria engaged with the public again and saved the crown.This is a very good book. However I think it relies heavily on Queen Victoria by by Lytton Strachey for its psychological portrait of Queen Victoria and her Prince Albert. This is not acknowledged. Where the book covers new ground is in it's research on and assertion that Prince Albert died of Crohn's disease."}, {"userName": "Mary Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8381331-mary-rose", "userReview": "Why read 50 Shades of Grey when you can read this unfortunate account of how creepy and awful Victoria's marriage to Albert was? Seriously, ick. If you had any inclination that Victoria was a good monarch, read this book. The whole marriage comes across as weirdly abusive and controlling, but there's probably a generational divide that I'm missing here. I hope I never love someone that much.Subject matter aside, it's a pretty good book, but it drags on forever. Albert dying alone takes up pages upon pages upon pages, and if it were half as long I don't think we would have lost much. Oh, and there was a whole chapter at the end about what actually killed Albert which I never finished.

I began this book, personally knowing very little concerning Queen Victoria's reign. I have always been a fan of architecture from that time frame, as well as interior decor. There just is such a romantic look to anything from the Victorian era. I don't think that this accidental. Queen Victoria was a hopeless romantic, her actions are proof positive of that fact.I did not take to Albert, Prince Consort, until shortly before he died. I felt that prior to her marriage, Queen Victoria was doing perfectly well, in her daily duty to her country. Having said that, I have to say that I have no tolerance for men who are controlling. I will never understand women, especially strong willed women who allow men to control them. So, when Prince Albert began taking over, I was quite frustrated with Queen Victoria, as I knew that she was going to have a difficult time to resume her duties as Queen. I have no doubt that Queen Victoria's profound grief, was most likely a severe form of depression. It is such a shame that she took no comfort in her children, nor in her grandchildren.I do understand whole-heartedly, being so in love with one's husband, that when they are taken away, being utterly paralysed by an all consuming grief. I even to a certain degree, understand the need to dedicate a memorial to his memory. Sadly, Queen Victoria could not seem to stop ordering statues and memorials. This was something Prince Albert expressed a distaste of, and had Queen Victoria promise him, that she would not do this, if he died first.I would love at this point, to read more on Bertie, and why neither Prince Albert, or Queen Victoria cared much for him. The Queen even stated that he made her shudder. It seems to me, from what I read in this book, that Bertie may have possibly had an affliction, which was not diagnosed, but preventing him from excelling in the fashion expected of him.I was relieved, when Queen Victoria slowly began to take on the expected duties of her, for England. It was also interesting that the one person who seemed to cheer her up the most, was her gherri, from Balmoral. Also interesting was the fact that once more he took control of many aspects of daily life. This not only upset the other servants, but Victoria's children. Can you imagine a servant referring to a Queen as \" wumman?\" But, the Queen had romantic feelings for John Brown, so she over-looked his gruff mannerisms. I have given away enough about this book, but if you are interested in the Victorian era, and have an interest in the English Monarchy, this book speaks volumes about how the Monarchy was affected during this 10 year time frame. Little did anyone in England know how the death of Prince Albert in December of 1861, would affect the whole country. Sadly for Prince Albert, he would die, without knowing that the people of England came to appreciate all his efforts in promoting the Fine Arts, and Education. Not to mention his daily duty to Queen Victoria's reign."}, {"userName": "Losososdiane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4437457-losososdiane", "userReview": "As an American, I have to admit that Queen Victoria was mostly an unknown historical figure to me. I knew she ruled for a very long time and that her era produced a certain architectural style of which I see many examples in San Francisco. I've seen Dame Judi Dench in Mrs. Brown. That's it! Thus this book was more than a little informative for me! I appreciate Helen Rappaport's detailed research and her careful synthesis of information. Perhaps I will have to read her work, Queen Victoria, A Biographical Companion, to raise my sense of respect for Victoria. I was convinced that she was suffering from depression after the death of Albert; however, I think that she never ever wanted to be head of the British Empire. Her desire seemed to be to have a strong and ethical husband for whom she could be a loving, supportive spouse and they could nurture a large and happy family together. That makes her life something of a tragedy. After reading this do I notice the numerous locations, statuary, bridges, etc., named for Albert. The suffering of her children, who became essentially motherless and fatherless after Albert's sudden and surprising demise, made this a difficult read. I went on to read about the short ten-year or so rule of Bertie, who does not come off looking responsible or intelligent in this book. I suspect he could only come out from under the pall of all that extended and unhealthy mourning after the death of his mother. The compassion and frustration of the public and the danger to the ruling family during Victoria's reign was completely unknown to me. I was mostly fascinated but the constancy of Victoria's focus on her mourning and self-pity which was somewhat tedious; however, that is what the politicians and citizens and royal relatives around Europe were experiencing, too. Clearly, I have a lot more reading to do and, of course, a trip across the pond to deepen my understanding here. I'd like to learn more about each successive generation of monarchs and relatives from Victoria forward. By the way, I won the British version of this book on the website of dovegreyreader of Devon and I was delighted to receive a signed copy. Soon this will be joined by more of Rappaport's works."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/293178-caroline", "userReview": "The archetypal image of Queen Victoria has always been of a short dumpy woman clad in black widows' weeds, sober and disapproving and endlessly mourning her beloved husband Prince Albert. This book charts the evolution of that image, exploring Victoria's devoted love for her husband and her obsessive mourning of him for forty years after his death in 1861.Death was an obsessive with Victoria, an obsession that began with the death of her mother several years before Alfred. Victoria wallowed in her grief, indulged in it, almost enjoyed it, and Alfred took her to task for this. She was incredibly dependent on him in both her domestic capacity as wife and as her Consort. Alfred was the power behind the throne, and it is likely that had he lived Victoria would have retreated ever-further into her position as his 'little wife'.When Alfred died Victoria resorted to this hysterical grief, and this time there was no-one to snap her out of it. Her grief was incredibly selfish and self-indulgent, and before her long her children, her ministers and the British public all tired of it. Republicanism began to gain ground, and there was real fear amongst the establishment that the monarchy could topple, with Victoria's adamant refusal to emerge from mourning, to take up her position as monarch, to appear in any kind of public setting. Rappaport argues very strongly that, consciously or not, Victoria used her grief to avoid siutations she didn't wish to deal with.I found this an interesting read, a very deft puncturing of the national myths of Victoria's as the squat dumpy middle-class monarch and Alfred as some kind of chevalier sans peur et sans reproche. Victoria herself had a great hand in establishing this image, of Alfred in particular, as part of her memorialisation of his memory. That it has lasted so long attests to her skill and devotion to immortalising her 'beloved Alfred'."}, {"userName": "Kathleen Hagen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291703-kathleen-hagen", "userReview": "Magnificent Obsession: Albert, Victoria, and the Death that Changed the British Monarchy, by Helen Rappaport, narrated by Wanda McCadom, produced by Tantor Media, Downloaded from audible.com.This book isn\u2019t as dramatically revealing as the title would suggest, but the author has done a wonderful job of researching letters and journal entries, (Queen Victoria kept a journal throughout her entire reign. We see how Prince Albert took on the work of ruling the British kingdom without a title, trying to \u201ctrain his wife, the queen, into her duties.\u201d For 20 years, the queen depended on the prince for all advice. Albert himself was so tied to his duties that he essentially worked himself to death. He missed his home in Germany, and the queen kept her castles at far too cold a temperature for him. When he finally became ill and was dying, the royal physicians couldn\u2019t figure out why but wouldn\u2019t let any other doctors in. For the last six days of his life they fed him brandy every few hours to try to stimulate his heart into more activity, something which certainly did not lead toward a cure. Victoria refused to believe he was dying, and when he did die, she went into what we would call a clinical depression today which lasted for ten years. She had to be coaxed to make any decisions for the country, and she wouldn\u2019t let herself be viewed in public. And she wore black and widow\u2019s weeds for the rest of her life, another 40 years. She gradually came out of her depression just in time. There had started to be rumblings about disbanding the monarchy, but she left a lasting mark on the rituals surrounding the death of royals from then to the present. A fascinating and well researched book. The narrator adopted a rather whiny voice for Victoria which I found annoying but was probably accurate. I strongly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "The Visual", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17114770-the-visual", "userReview": "The Victorian Age was one of the glorious and successful periods in British History and it might not have happened if Prince Albert, The Queen Consort, did not die of illness in 1861. Queen Victoria's reign could be divided in 2 eras, During-Albert and Post-Albert. While Prince Albert was alive, he served as the Queen's unofficial Private Secretary, Mentor and Adviser. He did more Royal duties whenever Queen Victoria was with child. And she was pregnant 9 times during their 21 years of Marriage.It could be summed up that Victoria's Magnificent Obsession was not Prince Albert but her idealization of him. She created a mythical memory of a Prince Consort that in the second half of her reign, he was almost forgotten. Victoria's real obsession was her commemoration of death, memorials and grief. She became fascinated with the ritual of sympathy and empathy that went along with death. It became one of her official duties to write condolence letters to the loved ones of those who departed. Her Royal Court followed strict Mourning Periods whenever someone close o the Queen dies.Her life was marked by various lost and tragedies. This might have been a consequence of living a long and full life. She lost 3 children in her lifetime, various grandchildren, her mother, her favorite Uncle Leopold, her devoted governess, John Brown and of course, Prince Albert.But Prince Albert's death became the catalyst for the creation of the real majestic and imperial Queen Victoria. The Queen that resonated through time and history. For those who are interested in the Victorian period and particularly the Victoria Royals. I would recommend the following books: Kate Williams' Becoming Queen Victoria; Jane Ridley's The Heir Apparent; Charlotte Zeepvat's Queen Victoria's Youngest Son: The Untold Story of Prince Leopold."}, {"userName": "John Wetterholt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6231912-john-wetterholt", "userReview": "Few love stories are as celebrated as that of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. From the uneasiness of their first meeting as teenagers to their enduring devotion over 21 years of marriage, their tale is the stuff of legend.No aspect of their lives illustrates this ideal more than the Queen's more than decade of mourning after the Prince Consort's unexpected death in 1861 at age 42. Victoria resolutely refused to engage in any more public functions than were absolutely necessary and only began to emerge from her self-imposed exile after her son the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) nearly died himself from an intense illness and was feted at a London Thanksgiving service in 1872.During the years of Victoria's seclusion, she comported herself as implacably bereft and acted as sovereign in little more than name only. Calls for her abdication ran rampant and public officials and common citizens alike expressed uncertainty over the future of the monarchy. The outpouring of sympathy and gratitude over the Prince of Wales' illness and subsequent recovery reaffirmed the relevance and worth of the monarch to both Victoria and her subjects as the Queen spent the last 30 years of her reign high atop the list of her country's most admired people.Helen Rappaport provides a revealing portrait of a family in turmoil showing the very human cost an early death exacts on those left behind. Victoria's status as Queen is never overlooked (many people wanted to, as Cher would do a century later, give her a [metaphorical] smack on the face and tell her to \"Snap out of it!\" but of course one does not deign to do so to a Queen!) but neither is the awareness that life must proceed for the living. The research is deep and the writing is enthralling. This fine work of historical biography can appeal to a broad range of readers."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19215373-chris", "userReview": "Most people have an image of Queen Victoria as a dumpy, dour old moralizing widow. Even those who have studied the period to some extent, and I include myself here, have only the standard \u2018refinements\u2019\u2014her lack of faith in her son, the future Edward VII, her unhappy childhood, her love of Albert, etc. Yet I don\u2019t ever recall being confronted with the image of Victoria as the unstable, grief-stricken recluse, hard at work as part emo teenager, part overbearing mother, and part funeral obsessive. Yet here, Helen Rappaport makes a very, very strong case. This book touches on a wide range of topics, from the effects of the national grief on the economy, literature, the lives of her children, architecture, memorials, the list goes on. Rappaport rather effortlessly moves the reader through every facet of Victorian life, yet never seems to get bogged down in unnecessary example or detail. The only real criticism I have of the way she presented material is that she spent a bit too long on Albert\u2019s final year (although I can understand her desire to show readers exactly how dependent Victoria was on him) and her tendency to brush over the political implications of the national morning. On numerous occasions, it is mentioned that Victoria was refusing to meet with foreign dignitaries or was hiding at Balmoral and forcing everyone to come to her, but a few strong examples would have rounded out this otherwise well-presented book. In short\u2014if you have an interest in the Victorian era, Victoria herself, or the culture of death and mourning associated with her reign, this is highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Persephone", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/877807-persephone", "userReview": "Having read and enjoyed Helen Rapport's book on the demise of Tsar Nicholas and his family The Last Days of the Romanovs: Tragedy at Ekaterinburg, I was anxious to get my hands on this. I was a little worried to find blurbs on the back from People Magazine, Charles Spencer (Diana, Princess of Wales' unpredictable brother), and Alison Weir, but I needn't have worried. This book is well-written and carefully researched.The relationship between Queen Victoria and her beloved consort Prince Albert is hardly a new topic, but Rappaport dedicates the first half of her book on the weeks leading up to Albert's untimely death in 1861, while the second half covers the following decade, during which Victoria retreated almost entirely from public life, much to the concern and exasperation of her family, government, and subjects. This is an interesting and well-researched look into the consequences of Albert's death and its impact on the Royal Family, Great Britain as a whole, and the mourning industry in particular.Rappaport treats the Queen's unremitting sorrow with just enough sympathy that we may not quite feel like strangling Victoria by the end, but we will have even more sympathy for Victoria's children (especially her daughters), her beleaguered courtiers and Albert himself. She includes an appendix on modern medicine's attempt to identify the illness that killed the Consort off."}], "description": "After the death of Prince Albert, the grief of Victoria and her nation was so profound that this one event was to dramatically change the British monarchy.
