To compare any children's book to Beverly Cleary's classic series just leaves one wide open to ridicule. The Ramona books are classics for a very particular reason; they place a sturdy, hard-as-nails finger directly on an age that is traditionally forgotten. Kids between the ages of six and ten are nebulous creatures. Too old to be cute little itty bitties and too young to enjoy the rights and privileges of their older kin, the 6-10 year old crowd straddles our traditional age ranges. Walk into any library or bookstore and you'll see titles for kids separated in a very particular fashion: picture books, easy readers (for when they're first learning to read), early chapter books (self-explanatory), and middle grade fiction. What's missing is what the Ramona books are. They're older than early chapter fiction but younger than middle grade. There is no term for this kind of book, and indeed it's one of the most difficult types of books to locate on a shelf. Now, at long last, The Year of Billy Miller comes to occupy that same space, but its similarities to Ramona don't stop there. Filled with heart, smarts, humor, and a boy-centric p.o.v. that is almost impossible to pin down, Henkes has finally done for the chapter book set what he\u2019s been doing for the picture book readers for years. He\u2019s created a character for the ages.Billy Miller wasn\u2019t always worried that he wouldn\u2019t be smart enough for second grade. To be blunt, the idea never even entered his brain. Then he fell. It wasn\u2019t life-threatening or anything but that fall from a guardrail to the ground certainly gave him a bump on the noggin. When he heard his mom confess to his dad that she worried there might be some kind of permanent damage, that\u2019s when his own worries started. Fortunately his Papa sets him right telling his son, \u201c... I know \u2013 and I know everything \u2013 that this is the Year of Billy Miller.\u201d Turns out, Papa\u2019s right. Between making up with his teacher, helping his Papa with his art, attempting to stay up all night with his little sister Sal, writing a poem about his mom and so much more, second grade is turning out to be a full year. And Billy Miller\u2019s going to be smart enough for all of it.Boy books. Oh, they're all the rage these days, didn't you know? Seems you can't walk two steps out your door without being barraged by calls to come save the boys. They don't read enough... no wait, they read but they need their own books. No, think again, they need more nonfiction. Or is it sports stories? Or humor? However you choose to define them, boy readers are highly sought after. Getting their personalities down on paper, however, is remarkably difficult work. The lazy writers will just throw some gross details on a page and then call their work done. Sometimes there will be a reference to sports and the like, but so many miss the point. When you're writing the p.o.v. of a boy you need to know exactly what it is that makes that boy tick. Now take Billy Miller here. Early in the book his parents are talking about his recent bump on the head and his mom says, \"But I worry that down the line something will show up. He'll start forgetting things.\" His father's dead-on reply is, \"He already forgets things... He's a seven-year-old boy.\"Evidence of Billy's boyness is everywhere. For example, when he\u2019s supposed to be writing a poem about his mother this is how the text explains his plight: \u201cBilly had trouble getting started. He opened his poetry journal to the first page and wrote: My Mom. He couldn\u2019t think of anything else to write, so he drew a series of volcanoes in progressive stages of exploding.\u201d It would be difficult for me to explain to you how much I love that detail, but if pressed I would try. Then there's his nemesis Emster. Henkes never highlights this fact, but it's probably important to note that long before she's making Billy's life a misery, Billy cast the first shot across her bow. Which is to say, when she introduced herself in class as \"Emster\" he was the one who mistakenly (but buffonishly) misheard her as \"Hamster\". That's the kind of move guaranteed to make an instant enemy, and though Billy never remembers this moment again (and, if he did, it's difficult to say if he'd know why it was so important) it's clearly the catalyst for things that come.Now consider the risk Henkes took with this book. His hero is seven. Yet Billy stars in a book that's 240 pages in length. There are some interstitial pictures, but nothing like what you'd find in the early chapter book section of your library. Even if you look up this title on something like Amazon.com you'll see that the suggested age for this book is \"8 and up\". Now does that make any sense at all to you? How many kids do you know that get a kick out of reading books about children younger than themselves? What we have here is a readaloud book. The kind of book meant for bedtimes and for those teachers who tackle a chapter a day in class. Henkes could have bowed out and upped his hero's age to nine or ten or even eleven. He didn't. He made Billy a 2nd grader because that's what Billy is. His mind is that of a second grader. His actions are those of a second grader. To falsely age him would be to make a huge mistake. Granted, Henkes risks alienating potential readers, but remember Ramona again. Aren't there older kids who like to read about her adventures? And hasn't she managed to last all these years in spite of these very concerns? You betcha. It's all about the writing, baby.To point out that the writing in this book is superb is akin to pointing out that air helps one to breathe. It\u2019s obvious. This is Kevin Henkes, after all. Still, I\u2019ve never quite connected to his novels in the same way that I\u2019ve connected to his picture books. It\u2019s probably just me (the shiny Newbery Honor sticker on Olive s Ocean is a clue) but his magnificent ability to hone a point down to its most essential details is very well suited to a 32-page format. I hadn\u2019t felt a similar ability until I read Billy Miller. First off, the lines themselves are just keen. Here are two of my favorites:\u201cBilly had known Grace since kindergarten. She was so shy she seemed almost invisible. Like vacuums, her wide eyes were sucking in everything.\u201d\u201cBilly sat alone, considering the choice he had to make. He sucked the web of skin between his thumb and pointer finger, his hand falling across his chin like a beard.\u201dBeautiful. Then there are the characters themselves, it\u2019s nice when the wise all-knowing parents (in this case, primarily the dad) is flawed. This is nice. He gets testy when his work isn\u2019t going well, which makes for a nice character detail. The mom sort of sinks into the woodwork (though she does have a nice moment with Billy when he has to write about what she likes) and it\u2019s hard to remember much about her, but the dad uses terms like \u201cIsn\u2019t she cute? Just looking at her shreds my heart.\u201d Sal, Billy\u2019s little sister, is an appropriate mix of cute and annoying. Billy is a typical older brother but you have to love it when he freaks himself out by thinking of scary things in bed and runs to her room for companionship and comfort. It shreds my heart, it does.In the end, The Year of Billy Miller is a stand-alone title that really does leave you wanting more. You've gotten so close to Billy and his family that they stick in your brain long after you've closed the covers. You can't help but hope that there are more Billy Millers on the horizon. To create just one would be a cruel tease. At the very least this book is a boon to any librarian who has faced a parent at a reference desk saying, \u201cMy kid loves Ramona. What else do you have like that?\u201d Ladies and gentlemen, we have our answer. Absolutely remarkable.For ages 5-10."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237191-emily", "userReview": "I once had a teacher who said, if one of us was flummoxed as to the accolades given a particular work or writer, \"Maybe you just weren't invited to the party.\" Though I'm a fan of a lot of Kevin Henkes's books, I was not invited to the party on this one. Two stars feels shabby, but \"It was ok\" is exactly how I feel. \"Billy\" has picked up lots of starred reviews and is widely considered a Newbery contender. The stories it tells--about the dread of feeling misunderstood by your 2nd grade teacher, a sibling who both annoys and comforts, wanting to do well on school assignments that go whimsically, parents going through tough times--feel reminiscent of ground better covered (and covered with more charm) in Ramona Quimby books. I recently read Ann Cameron's \"The Stories Huey Tells\"--another collection of episodes, some funny, some more serious, in a young boy's life--and it held much more magic and feels more memorable to me than Henkes's book."}, {"userName": "Rachael Stein", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5852865-rachael-stein", "userReview": "Read it while getting an extremely painful tattoo and liked it anyway. Review to come.ETA: here is the actual review! When I attend ALA, I usually approach author signings in one of two frames of mind. Sometimes - probably the majority of times - I am diffident and humble, giving them a quick \"thank you\" and getting out of their hair. This year, however, I went with the other approach, which I'll call \"wild-eyed fangirl.\" I hugged Laura Amy Schlitz and took a picture in her hat. I burbled and enthused at Anne Ursu. And when I finally got to the front of the Keven Henkes line, I burst out with, \"THANK YOU FOR WRITING SO RESPECTFULLY ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL LIVES OF CHILDREN.\" Mr. Henkes looked a bit bewildered and murmured something noncommittal, but I went away satisfied, because really, he needed to be thanked. I can't think of anyone else writing today who approaches the inner lives of five, six, and seven-year-olds as if he's writing Mrs. Dalloway. As I noted a couple of weeks ago, the emotional authenticity of Penny and Her Marble puts it at the top of my Newbery list for this year. In 2011's Junonia, he portrayed a certain shade of disappointment so honestly that it backfired and made a lot of people dislike the character. (Not me, though - I was that quiet, slightly spoiled ten-year-old living a charmed but melancholy life. Thanks again, Kev!) No matter the age group, Henkes groks kids.So I was pleased to see that, with his newest novel, Henkes is stepping into the early chapter book arena for the first time. The Year of Billy Miller is just that - a year in the life of a second-grade boy. Many of Henkes' novels defy conventional plot summaries, and I think the back flap copy on this one really misses the mark. \"Laugh-out-loud funny!\" it shouts. \"Dioramas! A second grade poetry slam!\" Calm down there, marketing folks. While this book does contain dioramas and a poetry program (\"slam\" is pushing it), it comes nowhere near the level of implied wackiness, and at no point did I find myself laughing out loud. This is not Clementine, and to market it that way is selling it short.The Year of Billy Miller is, like most Henkes novels, a quiet, slightly melancholy meditation on a collection of moments. It is structured episodically, in four parts (Teacher, Father, Sister, Mother) that chronicle Billy's conflict and reconciliations with the people closest to him. The Teacher section, for example, has echoes of Lilly and her purple plastic purse, as Billy struggles to correct a humiliating misunderstanding with his new teacher. Along the way, we see Billy grow and begin to come into his own, thereby fulfilling his father's prediction that this will be the titular \"year of Billy Miller.\" Throughout the book, Billy takes tentative steps towards increased self-confidence and mature relationships, until at the climactic poetry reading, he shows us just how far he's come.Billy Miller is primarily a character-driven book, and Henkes' beautifully complex characters are on full display. Billy, of course, is a wonderful, full-blooded second-grade boy, full of contradictions and half-baked ideas about the world. The other characters are fully realized as well, especially the occasionally moody stay-at-home artist dad. As always, Henkes uses his words sparingly but effectively, establishing character with telling details like the way the teacher involuntarily touches her hair when she thinks Billy is making fun of her chopstick hair accessories.Stylistically, Henkes is a minimalist, and the early chapter book format is the perfect showcase for that. The scene where Billy and his mother bury a dead bird is one of the loveliest stretches of prose I've read this year - filled with sensory details - but it is almost entirely devoid of adjectives or adverbs. Joanne Rowling, take note!If Billy Miller has a handicap at the Newbery table, it may be its episodic structure. Of course, that didn't keep The Graveyard Book from winning, and the two books share a thematic unity that ties the episodes together. My only other quibble: Henkes never really resolves Billy's conflict with Emma - a small but unsatisfying omission. Otherwise, this is definitely one of the year's best middle grade novels."}, {"userName": "Donalyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/829035-donalyn", "userReview": "A story that captures the magic of ordinary things--a smile from your teacher, your love for an annoying little sister, or sharing a quiet moment with your mom.

The presumption in children's literature is that kids want to read about someone older than they are, or their same age at the most. They might occasionally want to look back with a mix of nostalgia and humor especially if a book is part of a series, like Cleary's Ramona books. But something like this, with over 200 pages about a second grader? Unheard of. It's a very true and tender look at this particular second grader, Billy Miller. His concerns are realistic for a smart, sensitive kid--for instance, he makes a horrible face at a classmate who has upset him, and he realizes that his teacher thinks he made it at her. He gets frustrated while working in a diorama, and is mortified when his little sister shakes glitter over it to give his cave scene some fairies, and he looks at her \"with laser eyes\". His problems are small, but they are exactly right for a second grader living with a loving family, and they are realized with humor and interesting detail. As in most Henkes books, the adults are also very sensitive and kind, and they give Billy the room to work things out for himself. Kids who have already become fluent readers by first or second grade will rejoice in having a book about kids their own age, and other kids will enjoy having it read to them."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/580090-alison", "userReview": "Can you come of age as a second grader? Yes -- in small but meaningful ways. Kevin Henkes captures a perfect handful of them in this heartwarming and utterly wonderful book about a boy named Billy Miller who has normal kid worries as he starts (and, some months later, ends) his second grade year. He worries maybe he's not smart enough for the second grade. He worries that his teacher doesn't know he's a nice kid. But he hopes a lot too -- hopes he can succeed at staying up all night for the first time ever; hopes he can help his dad get back to making art again; hopes he can WOW his mom with the poem he writes about her.This is an honest but hopeful book about a kid's early experiences with taking responsibility, experiencing peer pressure, and seeing his ideas become complex and USEFUL enough to inspire not just kids but grown-ups. The events that inspire Billy's growth in these areas are what adults like to think of as \"small moments\" but to Billy Miller, as to ANY second grader, these things feel BIG -- big enough to make the whole year feel like it could just be \"the year of Billy Miller.\"Kids and adults will both be drawn in by the sensitivity and care of Henkes' characterizations -- as always, he allows the reader to glimpse the private, inner thoughts of a kid whose mind feels wholly familiar and whose small \"coming of age\" feels, in broad strokes, like a carbon copy of our own.This is a chapter book that fluent readers will be able to tackle, but I especially fill with glee at the thought of using it as a read-aloud. Either way it is a book worth sharing with all of the second grader(s) in your life - and the 1st and 3rd graders too."}, {"userName": "Destinee Sutton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90661-destinee-sutton", "userReview": "I really wish that, instead of a 229-page novel for 2nd graders, Henkes had written four 70-page novellas for 2nd graders.

It's nice for the Newbery committee to recognize a book for younger readers, even if I still believe this is really four books crammed into one too-long book.

It's about second grader Billy Miller who has a stay-at-home dad who is a struggling artist, a 3-year-old sister, and a mom who is a teacher. Billy Miller is starting a new year of school and it tells the story of his year through 4 chapters, each one focused on his relationship with the important people in his life.Billy definitely thinks and acts like a 2nd grader and I liked seeing how he learns to connect with each person in his family. During this year you see how he grows up a little bit more and he's endearing in that he's sweet and loving but he also gets frustrated, angry, and emotional. This is a cute chapter book with some funny parts but the jacket copy says it's laugh-out-loud which is a total stretch. It claims to be like the Ramona books but Ramona is a lot more mischievous and kooky and that makes her more funny. Some of the vocabulary is also a bit too sophisticated for 2nd graders so perhaps as a read aloud it would be okay. The sister's vocabulary and sentence structure also makes her sound like a 3-year-old prodigy. This is an okay book but I bet there are more awesome books out there.I learned that the term \"food baby\" has joined the elementary school vernacular."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4999690-angie", "userReview": "I don't normally read around this age range, and this book was a very simple read so it is fine for grades 1+, but I thought it was kind of boring. The main character goes through his second year of school in this book, and the length of the book might be intimidating to readers under second grade, but the writing style is definitely simple enough for 1st graders. So it has that going against it. Also, as I mentioned, it was boring. This book looks pretty long and intimidating, but most of that could have been cut back and shortened. Here's what happens to Billy in a year: He knocks himself out and gets a bump, he's afraid he's not smart enough for second grade, his desk partner is a little prat, his teacher may hate him, his father needs inspiration for his art, Billy wants to stay up all night, he writes a poem about his mother. All these \"plot points\" are resolved within a couple pages and completely forgotten, but somehow takes up 240 pages. It's as if each chapter was meant to be a separate, beginning chapter book, but Henkes decided to throw them all together to make a whole book.Anyway, I read this for our Mock Newbery, and it is certainly not getting a vote from me."}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1808749-allison", "userReview": "When Billy suffers a head injury right before the start of his 2nd grade school year, he and his parents are worried that he is going to under-perform, or exhibit memory problems.

Both his parents assure him he'll do great and will love his teacher. The year starts out a little rough: he's certain Ms. Silver doesn't like him, there's a new girl in class (Emma--a bit of a Bossy Pants) and the school work load is much higher than in first grade. But as the year progresses, Billy does find that it *is* his year, just as his mom said at the start of school. The year ends with the whole class reciting poems (on stage! with a microphone!) about someone important in their lives. For Billy? He chooses his mom.A relatively easy chapter book, this story fills a hole in that juvenile fiction section: the kids beyond easy readers, but not quite ready for the Boxcar Children. Henkes does a lovely job capturing a year in the life, exploring all aspects of Billy's school year. The book is divided into sections, advancing the year without bogging the reader down with a strict timeline. Henkes also has little bits of artwork sprinkled throughout, too! I appreciated the character development and how Henkes didn't feel the need to 'fix' certain things by the end of the story. For example, we never find out why Emma is such a pain, and she doesn't miraculously become Billy's best friend by the end of the book! The secondary characters also had personalities (impressive, as we're reading this book from a second grader's viewpoint). I was a little sad at how old the kids felt, though--Billy was pushing his parents away emotionally throughout, and Sal had a pretty good vocabulary for a three year old.

When nothing bad happens to the sister, I was going crazy thinking the author was going to kill off the mother, but there were not that many pages left! Then I though, oh no, Billy is going to be diagnosed with a brain tumor! The thoughts running in my head were really really awful as I conjured bad things that might happen: the parents get divorced, the parents die in a car accident, the sister gets abducted, or the teacher gets fired for not doing a normal play. My mind was truly racing.I know this book made it on many of the year's best books, and even a few mock Newbury lists floating about the Internet, so I thought something really crazy had to happen (beyond what you learn on the book flap that Billy bumps his head pretty badly while on vacation with his family.

And thought it is the relationship that Billy has with his dad that you see the most, the few scenes with his mom especially at the end are very touching. This is not a story that develops one aspect of being at school - it could have focused more on Billy's issues with Emma or his friendship with Ned or even his connection with Ms. Silver, but instead little things are touched upon or referred to and readers instead receive little glimpses into who Billy is (a typical 2nd grade boy) and what a year in his life it.

You look up one day and there's a fully developed, satisfying life around you, which you never realized your mundane everyday was leading to. Billy Miller is early on in his journey toward this realization. Starting second grade mere days after taking a nasty spill at the Jolly Green Giant statue in Blue Earth, Minnesota, Billy worries he might not be up to the challenge of a higher grade than he's ever been in before. His fall at the Green Giant landmark left him with a noticeable lump on his head, and what if it damaged what's inside his head, too? With that concern shadowing the back of his mind, Billy plunges into the excitement of the school year with a new teacher, some new kids, and of course his best friend Ned, who is in Billy's class.  A rocky start with Ms. Silver\u2014Billy's teacher\u2014doesn't last long, but Billy's encounters with Emma Sparks, a girl who sits at his table and occasionally rubs him the wrong way with her tendency toward smug superiority, are a recurring theme of the school year. Divided into four parts, The Year of Billy Miller focuses on a different important person in our protagonist's life in each section: Ms. Silver, Billy's Father (Papa), Billy's three-year-old sister (Sal), and Billy's Mother (Mama). An uncomfortable misunderstanding from the get-go with Ms. Silver may have given her the impression that Billy was making fun of her, but he wouldn't treat his teacher disrespectfully, especially not one as decent to learn under as Ms. Silver. Billy's Papa is a playful spirit who expresses himself through all forms of sculpture, but the creative muse goes silent from time to time for even the great artistes, and Billy can sense Papa's frustration when the artistic juices aren't flowing. The tension affects everyone in the family, and Billy wants to relieve Papa's anxiety and help him get back to enjoying his art. Can a second-grade boy do something that significant for his father? Sal goes back and forth between being a cute amusement and an annoyance to Billy, but she plays a vital role in his life even when he'd rather take a break from her. Sal has the proclivities and humor of a typical three-year-old girl, easily distracted and eager to entwine herself in games of nebulous fancy no one around her understands. But the good part of Sal always being there is that she is always there, should Billy need her for any reason. A baby sister comes in handy now and then, and that makes up for the times when she tries his patience. Billy's Mama is his foundational nurturer and most indefatigable supporter, though her role is changing some even at this early stage of peer pressure influence. He's not sure he should call her \"Mama\" anymore, a name the other kids might regard as infantile. But Billy doesn't want Mama to forget what she means to him, and a major school project provides the opportunity to write a poem about her. What is the right balance between sensibility and sentiment, a poem that will mean something to Mama without being too sappy to read in front of his classmates and their families? Billy wants to get the mixture right, and Mama can help him do it. By the end of second grade, it's been some year for Billy Miller. And there's much more to come around the next bend, wherever it takes him.  Ms. Silver informs her class on their first day together that it's the Year of the Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac, but Papa tells Billy that this year is going to be a lot more exciting than that. Billy is plenty smart enough to excel in second grade, Papa confidently declares, and this will be the Year of Billy Miller, a seven-year-old ready to make his fresh imprint on the surrounding world. That's what Billy does in this book, makes his impression where he can and on whom he can. The mark he leaves is faint, but memorable for those who come to care about him. There are no big, all-encompassing lessons for Billy or us to learn in this book, just the sweet simplicity of the everyday as it strolls by, the glory of a fleeting existence that often looks so much like drudgery, we can't discern the difference. It's hard to get ahead in life for long; as the narrative observes through Billy's eyes, \"He realized that as soon as one problem is solved, something else is right there, waiting to take up your time.\" The best we can do is address life's complications with swiftness and alacrity, welcoming the river of concerns that flows our way, seeing it for the quintessence of life that it is. Our smallest moments glimmer unexpectedly with beauty if we watch closely enough, and the detailed observer of Billy's life will find a few such glimmers in his story. He has a family who cares for and tries to be considerate of him just as he does in return, though it isn't always easy. \"I promise to always call you what you want to be called,\" Papa tells Billy. I guess that is the best way we can support our loved ones, by validating how they choose to define themselves, whatever that might mean, and accepting the direction they're headed even when we have no idea where they'll wind up. Papa's proclaimed Year of Billy Miller turns out to be a fine one, but there's a whole future filled with years that can be his. We can't help but hold a place for him in our hearts as he moves ahead into that future.  Newbery Medal winners and Honor books have tended to favor middle-grade literature in some eras, so it's refreshing to see a novel like The Year of Billy Miller be acknowledged with a Newbery. Billy is in second grade, so his story might not appeal to the middle-grade crowd, but I'm glad the Newbery Committee was unafraid to select this book. Would I have picked it to receive a 2014 Newbery Honor, though? Not a chance, frankly. Not in a year that offered candidates such as Snowflakes Fall by Patricia MacLachlan, Navigating Early by Clare Vanderpool, More Than This by Patrick Ness, The Lightning Dreamer by Margarita Engle, and The Thing About Luck by Cynthia Kadohata. The Year of Billy Miller is a nice, understated story, probably the quietest and most unadorned novel Kevin Henkes has ever published, but the candidates I mentioned, as well as others, were more deserving of the cache that comes with a Newbery. Nonetheless, The Year of Billy Miller is a fine story, solidly constructed, and Kevin Henkes continued his evolution as a novelist in it, introducing occasional small pencil sketches to accompany the narrative. Previously, Kevin Henkes had preferred keeping his world-class artwork out of his novels, an artistic choice intended to give free range to the reader's imagination.  I appreciate The Year of Billy Miller, and am happy for the validation the Newbery Honor citation is to it. For young readers who don't mind a slower, more easygoing story, this is a good option. We should treasure Kevin Henkes books in every size, shape, and style that they come. You won't find another author, illustrator, or author/illustrator like him."}, {"userName": "Morgan Efland", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76204414-morgan-efland", "userReview": "The Year of Billy Miller by Kevin Henkes (Newbery Honor Award) was a fun and easy read. I enjoyed getting to know Billy through his story of school and life. I would definitely use this book in third or fourth grade as either a read aloud or an independent read. Students will enjoy the way this book is written because it is such an easy book to read and follow along with. In a classroom I would use this book when teaching realistic fiction. This book has a very lighthearted tone that a lot of students would be able to connect with. The Year of Billy Miller would be a great book to teach students how to make connections when reading to understand the text better. Because this book is so relatable students would easily be able to pull out things from the text that they have experienced before and do a compare and contrast of their life to Billy's. This would also be a good book to talk about setting, characters, problem, solution, etc. because students would be able to clearly pick out and talk about the different things that are asked for. This book could also be fun for a book club in the class room since there is a lot of conversation that could be had with this book like making connections or finding the characters, setting, etc. like mentioned above. This was a WOW book for me because I loved how lighthearted this book was and how easy it was to read. I also enjoyed making personal connections to my life when I was a child and seeing how Billy acted with his family and school friends. I really liked seeing Billy grow throughout the book and see him transition from a little second grader to a grown up third grader.

The Year of Billy Miller is full of the tiny, silly issues seven-year-olds run into, and it never feels condescending about any of them. Whether it's charming or dull to you is basically a coin flip. For me, it was a little of both, at one point or another. I agree with a different reviewer who suggested this would have been a good beginning-reader series rather than one long book. However, I think this could have a good life as a read-aloud for classrooms of kids Billy's age, especially at the start of the year.(And, admittedly, I do love that it's set in Wisconsin.

I picked up the book at home just because it had a cool cover but ended up really liking it. I spent most of my time at home reading it. My favorite part was how he messed up reading his poem by memory so his mom gave him a copy so he could read it for everyone. Then at the after party he went back up on stage and read it from memory. No one noticed it besides his mom. I also liked how Emma would make fun of him because he called his dad Papa so Billy stopped calling him Papa and started calling him dad instead. However at the end of the book he went back to calling him Papa because he didn't care what Emma said about him anymore. I loved how he was able to overcome someone making fun of him. Before he was worried about being smart enough for school and he wanted his teacher to like him. I also enjoyed the part when his teacher, Ms. Silver, saw him drawing a picture of her with devil horns to be funny. He realized that she took it as him being mean to her so he brought her a whole bunch of little silver things."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52608968-kristin", "userReview": "Source: www.ala.orgBilly Miller is a realistic fiction chapter book about a second grader, Billy Miller. Over the summer, Billy and his family go on vacation and Billy falls and gets a bump on his head. He overhears his parents talking about it and his mom is worried that there may be permanent damage. Billy is now worried about being smart enough for second grade. He has other typical nine-year-old problems, like worrying about his teacher liking him, getting along with other kids in his class, and completing projects for school. Children will easily be able to relate to this book, as these are typical problems that any child could face. The events and plot resolution are realistic as well. Billy tries to stay awake all night, and he often gets annoyed with his sister. He gets embarrassed that he calls his father Papa and is fearful to tell Papa that he doesn\u2019t want to call him that anymore.The characters are realistic and have flaws like real people. Billy is a well-developed character. The reader is always able to know what he\u2019s thinking and feeling. Children will be able to make many connections to his worries, problems, and feelings. Billy can be inattentive, impulsive, imaginative, helpful and encouraging. The Dad is always helpful and willing to give advice, but can be irritable when he\u2019s having trouble with work. Sal is Billy\u2019s cute, but annoying, little sister that cries and ruins his plans. They have a typical brother sister relationship where they fight, but also seek each other\u2019s company and companionship. I listened to this as an audiobook. It was easy to listen to and the language that Henkes uses helps you to visualize. His descriptions and figurative language are so illustrative. For example, Henkes describes the sister\u2019s bedroom: \u201cThe nightlight was so bright that the yellow walls in her room glowed like the inside of a jack-o-lantern.\u201d The downfall to listening to this book is that one misses the illustrations. There are black and white illustrations throughout the chapter book that I did not have the opportunity to see.This book would be appropriate to read aloud to primary students and for intermediate students to read independently. It would be great to use when working on the strategy of visualization, and could also be used to analyze characters or to work on making connections. This would be excellent to use when teaching figurative language, as there are so many metaphors and similes throughout."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan", "userReview": "This is the type of book I haven't seen for a while, and it is wonderful to read! I read the book all in one day. My one problem with the book which is why it lost the fifth star, is the question of audience. In terms of reading level, it is about a grade 3-4 book. In terms of length, it is about a grade 5-6 book. In terms of the main character, it is for second graders. My experience is that usually kids don't really want to read about kids younger than themselves. So I am not sure this would be an easy sell. But if you can persuade a kid to read it, I will almost guarantee they will love it! Why? This could be about themselves, or their friends in school. The aggravating kid is one I'll bet most kids know. She isn't really mean, but she sure isn't nice either. BTW it is a relief to have a character like that without the backstory to explain that the character is having a hard time in life due to abuse, etc etc. This character, who isn't really bad, just aggravating, is simply there. Which is the way most kids will experience someone like her. Billy goes through a year of his life in second grade. As usual, school is huge in a kid's experiences and that is true in this book. There is also a lot of home life which is nice to see too. Billy doesn't seem to be in organized sports, planning on changing society, or otherwise scheduled far too much for a small child's life. This is also getting rather unusual in books. No, Billy simply lives. He is annoyed by his kid sister but admits mostly to himself eventually that he does like her a lot at times. I'm sure Billy would speak up and deny it right now, but that is also what kids that age would do. As not unusual, Billy gets off to a bad start in school but thanks to an understanding teacher who doesn't condemn the child because of one error, he grows to like his teacher and be liked by her. Billy uses age appropriate problem solving when he realizes he might have antagonized the teacher and it succeeds. He is aware of his father's frustration in his work, and wants to help and actually does which makes Billy and Papa, I mean Dad, feel happy and proud. Billy is pretty egocentric, in a nice normal way for his age. He is just plain a nice kid to be around and to experience a year of his life. Nothing really spectacular happens in this book. The climax is the end of the year show the kids and teacher put on for family. Nothing much happens: no tornado or earthquake comes along and destroys the building. But Billy had to put in harder work than he expected in preparation and then got paralyzed with fear when actually looking out at the huge audience. Luckily Mom and Mrs, Silver, the teacher, had a backup plan to get him through the crisis. Billy, his Mom, family and teacher all end up happy with the results. That is perhaps what makes this book so special: it is not thrilling exciting but it covers things important to kids at that age. This book just about had to be based on Mr. Henkes own memories of what it is like to be that age, or experiences that he's had with his own children. Everything in this book rings true. I suspect that Beverly Cleary's Henry Huggins and Billy Miller would likely get along with each other just fine, if they met while at the same age. Cleary is the leader of realistic fiction for the young and I think she may have a worthy successor in Kevin Henkes. I hope we see more of Billy Miller as he grows up!PS whew! At least I can now talk intelligibly at the Newbery/Caldecott Banquet in a few weeks!

It makes me seriously wish that I could temporarily morph into a second- or third-grade teacher, so as to experience the satisfaction of reading aloud this gem-of-a-tale to a classroom of young students. Billy Miller heads into his second grade year shortly after experiencing a mishap involving his new baseball cap and the lookout platform that is situated between the feet of the (55.5 foot-tall) Jolly Green Giant statue in Blue Earth, Minnesota. His natural apprehension over the beginning of a new school year is multiplied by his recognition of his parents worries about him and the fine lump on his head he gained in his fall from that lookout platform. Is he smart enough, he wonders, for second grade?The new school year also brings challenges resulting from a girl in his class with whom Billy quickly develops a mutual antagonism, and a restlessness on the part of Billy's father, who stays home with Billy's little sister and who is seeking success and fulfillment with his artwork. \"Billy sighed. He realized that as soon as one problem is solved, something else is right there, waiting to take up your time.\" Among the highlights of the other challenges he faces over the course of the school year is his coming to terms with having a younger sibling. There is also the fun self-challenge of trying to stay awake all night long. And the challenge of writing and then performing a poem before classmates, parents, and other relatives. This is all written about in such a genuine, heart-based, and thoughtful manner, and is a book I would have loved back in my own young years. A high-level transitional reader structured in four sections, Teacher, Father, Sister, and Mother, THE YEAR OF BILLY MILLER is an absolutely beautiful and wonderful read.

I was first introduced to his books when my daughter\u2019s first grade teacher read Chrysanthemum to the class. She loved the book and so did I. We were hooked on Henkes. Together we read Owen, Julius the Baby of the World, Chester\u2019s Way and Lilly\u2019s Plastic Purse. They were all great books, with sweet illustrations, a story with a message and usually an \u201cah hah\u201d moment. They also had pattern, repetition and rhythm, just like a song. I was sad when she moved on to books for older readers. So did Kevin Henkes, but not soon enough for us. Now as a children\u2019s librarian, I have rediscovered Kevin Henkes, and have read some of his fiction books. The Year of Billy Miller is what I would call an \u201cin-between\u201d book. Not a picture book, not a reader, but not quite a novel either. The print is larger, the text is double-spaced and there are a few black and white illustrations scattered throughout the book. Good books for this in-between age are hard to find. Characters are either stereotypically too smart for their own good, bratty, or involved in unusual situations. The Year of Billy Miller is simply a glimpse into the 2nd grade school year of a young Wisconsin boy \u2013 his fears, worries and accomplishments. The book is divided into four parts, Teacher, Father, Sister, Mother. As with all Kevin Henkes books, the action is low key, but the characters are well drawn and believable, and the families are kind and loving. So is Billy\u2019s teacher, Mrs. Silver. She really understands 2nd grade boys. When she tells Billy that he was smart to protect himself when he fell over the summer, those few words of kindness made Billy feel \u201cas if he were filled with helium like a balloon and might rise off the floor.\u201d Billy\u2019s year at home and school includes, cancelled sleepovers, sibling temper tantrums, an artist stay at home dad, a diorama homework assignment, and a school poetry slam. This book would be ideal for kids reading at about 3rd grade level, but Henkes is not shy about throwing in some bigger vocabulary words like, contagious, scrutinize, unconvincingly, illuminating. The Year of Billy Miller is a heartwarming book, and the perfect beginner novel for the elementary grades. It would probably appeal to boys more than girls, but girls would like it too."}], "description": "Award-winning, nationally bestselling author Kevin Henkes introduces second-grader Billy Miller in this fast-paced and funny story about friendship, sibling rivalry, and elementary school.
