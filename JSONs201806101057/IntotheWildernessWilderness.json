{"ratings": 30075, "userreviews": [{"userName": "ALPHAreader", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4285990-alphareader", "userReview": "OUTLANDER FANFICTION?It\u2019s impossible not to compare Donati\u2019s series to Diana Gabaldon\u2019s epic \u2018Outlander\u2019. Both series are historical romance, on a grand serial scale, and the marketing of Donati\u2019s series is largely reliant on Diana Gabaldon. Not only does a Gabaldon quote appear on the front-cover of \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019, but Donati thanks Gabaldon in her acknowledgements. And the most obvious comparison is the fact that Donati\u2019s books are a sort of fanfiction crossover to Diana Gabaldon\u2019s famous series. In \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 characters make brief mention of a Scot turned Indian called Ian, and his \u2018white witch\u2019 aunt Claire, and her big red-haired husband. This thin relation to \u2018Outlander\u2019 would have guaranteed Gabaldon readers would make the trek to Donati\u2019s series, which is the reason I picked up \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019.I am a HUGE Diana Gabaldon fan. \u2018Outlander\u2019 is one of my all-time favourite novels, and like so many of her fans I find myself needing a reading supplement to tide me over between Gabaldon\u2019s four year long writing lapses.\u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 is perfect for those \u2018Outlander\u2019 fans who really got into the series when Jamie and Claire went to live in the American wilderness. When the series took that trajectory Gabaldon introduced Native American\u2019s to the storyline, and if you\u2019re like me you especially loved the character arc of Young Ian who went on to become an Indian warrior. But more than that, the storyline becomes about the frontier life \u2013 small, new communities dealing with prejudice, hardships and their own brand of claustrophobia out in the American wilds.THE LAST OF THE MOHICANSDonati\u2019s series is a continuation of \u2018Last of the Mohicans\u2019, the 1826 story by James Fenimore Cooper. Her series features Nathaniel Bonner, who is Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis for those only familiar with the movie adaptation) and Cora\u2019s son. Nathaniel Bonner is the story\u2019s hero... and he\u2019s a fair bit swoon-worthy.Nathaniel\u2019s hands tightened on her upper arms until she gave in and looked up, and then he held on to her gaze and refused to let her look away.\u201cListen, now. Richard wants the mountain and he\u2019ll take you to get it.\u201dElizabeth tried to drop her head but he put a finger under her chin to lift it and looked her directly in the eye. \u201cI want you,\u201d he said.A warm rush of breath left Elizabeth. She could smell him, the oil on his skin. Leather and sweat and blood.\u201cI wake up wanting you and go to sleep wanting you,\u201d Nathaniel murmured, pulling her shoulders up to him so that her head fell back and the arch of her neck rose to meet him. \u201cElizabeth. I want you as much as I want to breathe, but I need the mountain.\u201dNathaniel\u2019s heroine is Elizabeth Middleton \u2013 a 29 year old spinster who never thought she would find love in the wilderness, let alone with an adopted Mohawk. Elizabeth was a wonderful protagonist; she is hot-headed, stubborn and entranced by the Mohawk way of life.NATHANIEL BONNER / JAMIE FRASERELIZABETH MIDDLETON / CLAIRE RANDALL FRASERNathaniel Bonner is no Jamie Fraser (that would be a tall order) but he is an exciting hero for our heroine. His being Mohawk makes him thrillingly exotic, and the little bit of savage in him makes their romance titillating and scorching.Elizabeth is likewise no Claire Fraser \u2013 but a lot of Claire\u2019s appeal lies in her delivering 19th century humour to the 17th century. Then there\u2019s the fact that Claire is a doctor, and Elizabeth a schoolteacher - so in general Claire has more thrilling storylines from her occupation.Diana Gabaldon writes more explicit, steamy sex scenes than Donati. But Donati\u2019s sex scenes are sweet and plentiful, and easily communicate Nathaniel and Elizabeth\u2019s love for one another.ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENTSI think Nathaniel and Elizabeth\u2019s hasty romance is one of the big pro\u2019s of \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019. If you are one of those readers who attempted \u2018Outlander\u2019 but weren\u2019t patient enough to trudge through the slow start, then \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 is probably more your pace. The romance kicks off from the get-go, with Nathaniel and Elizabeth meeting within the first 10 pages and an obvious attraction kindling. From there the central focus of the book is on the Romeo and Juliet romance between Nathaniel and Elizabeth \u2013 a white woman and an adopted Indian. \u2018Outlander\u2019 dealt with Claire\u2019s time-travelling mishap and determination to get back to 1940\u2019s England, as well as Scottish clan politics, and the lead up to Culloden. But \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 has a much more basic focus. It is a romance, first and foremost. This is about Nathaniel and Elizabeth \u2013 everything else is backdrop and obstacles to their happiness.DIANA GABALDON / SARA DONATIDonati\u2019s series has a few major differences with \u2018Outlander\u2019; the main one being an absence of fantasy, because there is no \u2018time travel\u2019 plot.It\u2019s tough to fairly compare \u2018Outlander\u2019 and \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019. I think Diana Gabaldon has more writing finesse; her series is more grand-scale epic and she revels in a slow-as-molasses storytelling that lets layers unfold, cliff-hangers erupt and characters arcs naturally progress. Gabaldon also has a very distinct and wonderful voice \u2013 even the dullest passages (like Claire\u2019s medicinal descriptions) are riveting when written in her succulent, lyrical prose.Donati also has a beautiful writing style \u2013 not as consistently breathtaking as Gabaldon\u2019s, but quite a few lines and paragraphs of Donati\u2019s really struck me. Some of her scenes read like snapshots of a moment, so vivid and colourful that they bear re-reading;They stood leaning toward each other across the awkward expanse of their snowshoes, joined like a wishbone by the soft suckling of mouths.Reading \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 I started to think that Diana Gabaldon and Sara Donati have very different strengths and weaknesses \u2013 and it often occurred to me that one\u2019s faults was the other\u2019s forte.DIALOGUEI think Diana Gabaldon is much more adept at writing dialogue than Sara Donati. Gabaldon\u2019s characters speak into your ear, so believable are their speeches \u2013 especially when she is putting weasel words and round-about talk into their mouths. Jamie Fraser is the perfect example of her cleverness with dialect \u2013 the way Jamie\u2019s words change depending on his audience, or his cloak and dagger speeches.In \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 I often thought that characters weren\u2019t very convincing in their diatribes. It was a case of people talking too directly and succinctly, getting their complicated messages across with little misunderstanding. Like when Nathaniel Bonner talks to Elizabeth about his deceased wife, Sarah. Much was made of the fact that Nathaniel felt uncomfortable talking about Sarah, but when the time came I found his words flowed so easily and revealed his hidden depth of feeling. It was at those times when I think Chekhov\u2019s idiom of \u2018leave them cold\u2019 could have worked better, if Donati had left some motivations unsaid.HOME LIFEI think Sara Donati is better at writing home life scenes. A lot of the story takes place on \u2018Lake in the Clouds\u2019 and \u2018Hidden Wolf\u2019 mountain \u2013 there was a very good chance that Donati writing many domestic scenes of wedded bliss could have been repetitive and dull. But she writes so thoroughly and fascinatingly about Mohawk life and Elizabeth\u2019s observations of it that I was happy to meander along with the more sedate scenes of domestication.In contrast; in Diana Gabaldon\u2019s books I am never totally easy with domestic scenes \u2013 whether they be on the mountain or Lallybroch. I think it\u2019s because Gabaldon is so adept at writing action and heart-palpitating plot that anything slower is sometimes frustrating to trudge through. Then there is the fact that I know any slow scenes of domesticated bliss will be short-lived for Jamie and Claire, and when they are idle at Lallybroch I am constantly on-edge for the next disaster.RUTHLESS WRITERDiana Gabaldon is, overall, more ruthless when it comes to storyline. I found in \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 that the overall plot was a little hazy. The first-half of the book sets Dr. Richard Todd up as Nathaniel and Elizabeth\u2019s adversary. But Todd isn\u2019t much of a \u2018villain\u2019, if he\u2019s one at all. He\u2019s all shades of grey and actually fairly easy to empathize with. Whereas in \u2018Outlander\u2019 Black Jack Randall is a truly masochistic villain \u2013 he is a very clear bad guy to Jamie Fraser\u2019s good guy. And the British Dragoons against Scottish clans act as another black/white tale.At the end of \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 I really couldn\u2019t decide if there was any particular storyline \u2013 or if it was just a matter of character\u2019s reacting to situations instead of acting. Even when the second-half of the book turns more inward and sets up the racist townsfolk as the new threat to the Bonner clan, I never really found that to be a substantial plot. Mostly because the stakes were never very high \u2013 I never once doubted that all would finish in a happy ending for Nathaniel and Elizabeth. In contrast Diana Gabaldon had a very helter-skelter plot, clear good guys and bad guys and high stakes to get caught up in.Diana Gabaldon is especially ruthless when it comes to story because she isn\u2019t afraid to put character\u2019s in terrible situations, let the good guys lose once in a while and let the bad guys triumph occasionally. But Donati seems more inclined to take the easy way. I don\u2019t want to give anything away, but events turn to Nathaniel and Elizabeth\u2019s favour quite easily and neatly.CONCLUSIONI have fallen in love with Donati\u2019s world, and Nathaniel and Elizabeth\u2019s saga. I especially loved the book because I can see that Donati has quite a story arc in store \u2013 currently there are 6 books in the series, all of them 800+ pages long. For an Outlander lover like me, the prospect of discovering a new saga to sink my teeth into is enough to give me goosebumps. Especially when I consider how long it takes Ms. Gabaldon to pump out a new \u2018Outlander\u2019 instalment (4-5 years!) \u2013 I now have Donati to tide me over in the meantime, and fill my epic historical romance craving. Hoorah! I am especially thrilled at the prospect of reading more little mentions and side-notes about Gabaldon\u2019s characters who cross-over into Donati\u2019s world.If you\u2019re an Outlander/Diana Gabaldon fan, you should definitely give Sara Donati a read. Diana Gabaldon is still my favourite, and nothing can rival \u2018Outlander\u2019 (Nathaniel Bonner is no Jamie Fraser, though a good contender) but \u2018Into the Wilderness\u2019 is in the same Outlandish vain and just as wonderfully grand-scale to get swept away by."}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Reto #24 PopSugar 2017: Un libro que suceda en la naturaleza salvaje\nAntes de comenzar mi rese\u00f1a quiero contarles que el personaje principal de esta novela no es ni m\u00e1s ni menos que el hijo de los protagonistas de El \u00faltimo de los mohicanos (no del libro, sino de la pel\u00edcula que protagonizara Daniel Day-Lewis, ya que la historia de James Fenimore Cooper tiene un final algo diferente). Comenc\u00e9 el libro sin saber ese dato, pero era inevitable que la ambientaci\u00f3n y la caracterizaci\u00f3n de los personajes no me recordaran a esa maravillosa pel\u00edcula, hasta que Elsa me abri\u00f3 los ojos (gracias!) y, a partir de ah\u00ed, si ya me gustaba, definitivamente me enamor\u00f3.Como rese\u00f1a, la verdad, no s\u00e9 muy bien qu\u00e9 decir que pueda traspasar lo maravilloso que es este libro.

Not a good sign I'd like it, if this was being marketed to those who frequent the romance aisle. The prose was more readable than most books I've read marketed as romance, even if hardly stellar, but what killed this novel for me is how it takes the \"historical\" out of historical fiction. This is set in the New York frontier in 1793, dealing with the twenty-nine-year-old Elizabeth Middleton. Raised in England, she's come to America hoping to set up a school. New York is my own state, and the idea of a novel set there during that period intrigued me. However, two examples of a lack of grounding in the period stood out to me before the fifty page mark. The first is when a woman talks about how they could use a \"schoolmarm.\" The fact is during the colonial and Federal period, school teachers in America were overwhelmingly under twenty-five, White and male. Not only wouldn't a person assume a teacher would be female--the feminization of the profession didn't begin until late in the 19th Century--but Miss Middleton would invariably have stirred up opposition because of her gender. Back then women weren't thought to have the authority or strength to control a classroom with children older than eight. Also, at a certain point, Nathaniel Bonner, (seemingly patterned after Cooper's Nathaniel Bumppo) calls Elizabeth a \"bluestocking,\" and she doesn't know what that is. The term was common in Britain in the period. I've seen people poo poo this kind of criticism. It's just fiction they cry. Nonsense! Part of successful fiction is that you don't jar a reader out of their willing suspension of disbelief; and the appeal of historical fiction is the sense you're entering into another time and place, not reading about modern people in costumes. This isn't to say some allowances shouldn't be made and some mistakes forgiven. Elizabeth Middleton from the beginning struck me as far too modern in her sensibilities--she doesn't seem to care about class or race and wants to keep her independence and remain unmarried. I'm willing to allow that; her mother was said to be a Quaker, so a reader can allow Elizabeth some nonconformity, but I could never settle in comfortably into a belief in the tale, which quickly shaped up to be a rather formulaic romance riffing off Last of the Mohicans with guest starring appearances from Jamie and Clare of Outlander and cameo roles from Jane Austen's novels. (Poor Jane Bingley, forced to appear in such a tawdry bodice-ripper.) This novel reads like really, really bad fan fiction, one that impoverishes rather than enriches the originals."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44435669-jess", "userReview": "I feel like I've just been on a Walk-a-bout and returned a different person after one of the most compelling reads of 2017 for me. INTO THE WILDERNESS by Sara Donati has been an absolute pleasure to read and a experience I won't soon forget. I love getting recommendations from books friends. They seem to always know what I need when I need it-and the absolute joy, heartache, sorrow, love and hate emotions I've just gone through while reading this exceptional book is enough to last me a life time. I can't fault them though. They know me well and knew I'd fall in love with both Nathaniel and Elizabeth. So much detail. Everywhere. From the brilliant characters, sub and main, from the beautiful descriptions of the gorgeous landscapes to the heightened emotional state of so many situations, I'm spent and obsessed. The layers of Elizabeth were something to behold. She's stubborn and lovely, fearsome and brilliant, daring and so brave. I simply adored her and her tenacity. Nathaniel is one of a kind. A character I'll soon never forget. Loyal, manly, strong and lethal-I've got one hell of a hero worship thing going on for him and I can't seem to get enough. Robbie, Bears, Hannah and all of the characters that made this journey come to fruition has been amazingly captured by Donati, she is special and I'm sorry this has been a first for me from her but I can assure you all, won't be my last. I cannot capture all of the awesome I just experienced. I feel like I've been torn apart and put back whole. Richard Todd, you better keep your word or you'll have me to answer to. I loath that man-despite any redemption he may have exuded towards the end. I wish there had been an epilogue, I fee like there is so much more to see and read and I'm struggling with how long I have to wait until I find out what Nathaniel and Elizabeth get up to next. So much unfinished business, but it was a good place for a break.

With this in mind, she sets out into the wilderness that is \"Paradise\" to join her father and brother. What she doesn't know is that her father who faces financial ruin has arranged to marry her off to the local doctor with the promise of bequeathing half of his large land holdings to her. She's livid and attracted to a man most unsuitable . . .Nathaniel, who was raised by Native Americans is just as attracted to Elizabeth. Her tart tongue and independence intrigue him as much as her looks but he knows their attraction can only lead to pain. When Elizabeth discovers her father's plan she's already fallen deeply in love with Nathaniel and decides to concoct a little deception of her own which will enable Nathaniel to have the land he so longs to make his own. But things aren't going to go smoothly for all involved as the doctor is determined to have the land no matter the cost . . .This is a fictional story filled with historical information and action-adventure along the lines of Diana Gabaldon (minus the paranormal bits). It's long but interesting and the characters leap off the page but somewhere midpoint this book just didn't resonate with me the way I expected it to.It was readable but not exceptionally gripping. The love story didn't touch me emotionally and it's just too darn long. I appreciate the attention to detail but without the characters engaging me it became an almost tedious read.

Not only because of the length, the epic-style kind of romance, but.. another reason I won't disclose. I can't say it's better or worse than the other book but in some ways there's more to love here. At least as far as one character. Our lead lady. While Claire is fierce and wonderful, don't get me wrong, she's also a woman out of time. Donati's Elizabeth is fierce and wonderful and forward thinking and for a woman of her time that's something else indeed. \"I came here to be free of the restrictions I lived under in England.

I loved how compelling their complex connection was; how they were drawn to each other despite all the odds, and everything they endured, fought against, and fought for. And this is only book one of a fucking six book series. Aaaaaa. Nathaniel saw something he had forgotten about women : that words can do the same work as hands and mouths and a man's body, that she was as undone by his admission of desire as she had been by his kiss.There is a host of characters, both good and bad, and a bevy of situations, circumstances, celebrations, deaths, conspiracies.. like, I can't even get started because otherwise I'll be here all day. There were certain people I disliked from the start and never grew to love, some who surprised me along the way, and others I can't wait to see more of in the coming books. There's so much here and the romance is really only the beginning (even if it is something else). The clash of culture and race -- made even more interesting as a result of our hero being a white man raised by a Mohawk clan, and all the complexities surrounding his own struggle of finding his place and identity over the years -- in addition to a village full of personalities, beliefs and greed, result in this book being quite the melting pot of adventure, thrills, and agonies. But it's also wonderful, funny, sexy, surprising and touching. \"Grandmother doesn't think much of your kind of schooling.

I am not into Frontier romances and was reading this for my Romance Across the Ages Challenge, but I am very glad I did read it.The author does a fabulous job of recreating that time and place in America's history, and while the lack of education, the racism and the ruggedness of the characters often got to me, it somehow fitted in so well with the theme, I soon let it go. (I did find the character of Julian, the heroine's brother, very disturbing and sad. His redemption came at great cost, but there was really nothing else that would do it. He was so lost.)The insight into the local Native American culture was fascinating. And not sanitised, either, with a romantic sort of glow. The Native Americans came across as real individuals. Certainly much more in harmony with the earth- they were natural conservationists. I just cringed in misery at much of the behaviour of the white settlers, but I guess they just didn't know any better, and were certainly not prepared to learn from people they considered inferior.Recommended for those who like epic tales that span generations. I don't, so I doubt I will be reading any more in the series, but I am sure there are many other readers who will devour these books. A very impressive, well-researched book that had me breathless until the end."}, {"userName": "Kindling Micky ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18967379-kindling-micky", "userReview": "4.5 stars audio reviewI file this mentally under 'epic reads' for so many reasons. The two lead characters, Elizabeth and Nathaniel are ones to measure up to. The frontier setting was magical, rough and required hardiness. The description was superb, even though this is not country I can identify with, I think I conjured a good version in my imagination, in people, clothing, wilderness, animals, smells and culture.We talk about strong heroines in books but Elizabeth Middleton is one of the most notable strong women I have ever had the pleasure to meet in a book. She's headstrong, opinionated, capable but also makes stupid decisions on the odd occasion and has a good cry. I loved her, I felt I could identify with her as a women and respect her. Nathaniel was a worthy match but oh so different. It was this difference in both personality, language, culture and lifestyle that made this book wonderous. The cast of side characters were richly painted and made my reader's heart sing. Worthy of mention are Robbie, Curiosity and Bears to name a few. The culture was hugely interesting to me; the Mohawk people and life made for fascinating reading, especially Elizabeth's navigation of that world. I loved that Elizabeth tolerated no prejudice and was a real advocate for Mohawk land and rights. I have no idea of the authenticity how the Mohawk people were written but it seemed respectful and I got lost in their world.On finishing, I find myself deflated because 30 hours of superb narration are over and I'm not sure another audiobook will appeal for some time. It is difficult to measure up to such a book as this. This is a favourite of 2017 and suspect a favourite of all time. Recommended to each and every one of my book friends.Reviewed for Jo&IsaLoveBooks Blog."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "I have really enjoyed the first book in the series entitled Into the Wilderness. The basic storyline has been well-researched and there is great depth in the character development. It is refreshing to have the main character depicted for her intelligence, her analytical skills, and her strong resourcefulness. This is not your typical historical fiction with bodice ripping and muscular physiques on every page. Elizabeth is even deemed a spinster, being a woman in her late twenties, not a robust 18 year old. The backdrop of major historical events adds to the challenges faced by the characters in that time period. Yes, it is the size of a housebrick, but a satisfying read."}, {"userName": "Marquise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4674014-marquise", "userReview": "I've had this book for years, but was always reluctant both to crack it open and to give it away. Until I decided to do both: read it first and give it away after. The result is, I'm keeping the book till it rots.Ironic, isn't it?Looking back, I can pinpoint my wariness as stemming from two things: for one, that it was compared to, linked to, and said to be copied from \"Outlander\" and heartily recommended for and by fans of Gabaldon. And the thing is, I disliked that book, so the surest way to get me to never read a book was to compare it to \"Outlander.\" Now, I can see why it'd have been marketed as such, but out there are many people who'll also be pushed away by this, as I was.And secondarily, it was the other half of the marketing claims: that this continues James Fenimore Cooper's \"The Last of the Mohicans.\" That was, singlehandedly, why I'd bought this book in the first place. I watched the film with Daniel Day-Lewis as Hawkeye over a decade before I read the book, and I recall the impression it made on me both for the story and the stupendous soundtrack. Later, when I read the book, I concluded that I liked the original story much better. Cooper's writing may not be stellar, but the original plot was wonderful, tragic ending and all; and when I realised that Donati had written an alternate version of said plot, I wasn't exactly happy because I learnt she opted for the film's version of Hawkeye and Cora's stories instead of the book plotline. Many might love the film's version best as it gives them the \"happy ending\" they would've wanted, but for me it's my major objection to the film, as it hurts the characterisation of Uncas and Major Heyward in the novel, not to mention completely changes the motives and characterisation of Hawkeye and Cora and Alice. This novel by Donati turned out to be along the plot of the film rather than follow the Leatherstocking Tales, in that it picks up the alternate plotline of Hawkeye and Cora ending up together just like in the film, and inserts as a new element their having a son to become a protagonist here. Chingachgook is about the sole character that basically stays as he is in all three versions: Cooper's, the film's and Donati's.But the worst endorsement possible for this book came from the \"Outlander\" crowd. Besides pushing some people away, it attracts equivocal comparisons that can lead to equally unfair expectations. For the sake of this novel, I hope many come to realise that this isn't similar at all, and besides a random mention of Claire and Jamie (which I also hope is just a random and unnecessary fangirly inclusion by the author, and that they do not appear in later volumes) there's nothing to draw comparisons on a fair basis. In fact, I hold that such random inclusion as one of the novel's worst parts, because . . . let's face it: what is a character from a time-travel romance doing in a purely historical fiction novel? How would Claire and Jamie end up existing in \"Into the Wilderness\" which is devoid of science-fiction elements that \"Outlander\" possesses? It makes no sense at all, it's illogical and stretches believability to breaking point. No, it breaks believability, in fact. I am not sure the author thought it out well.Once one gets over these bumps in the road, though, and decides to enjoy the novel on its own, shutting off and resisting comparisons, it's quite a rewarding read. I loved the setting in a small village in post-Revolutionary America, where Mohawk inhabitants and white settlers have to interact on a regular basis, with the subsequent racial tensions, prejudices, conflicts, but also loyalty and respect in some cases. The cast of characters is manageably ample: not too many that you lose track of them, and some of them are well fleshed-out, on both sides. Even the one that plays main antagonist is rather gray-shaded instead of a tar-black baddie, and with deeper motivations than thought in the beginning. And the main characters . . .Let me tell you about Nathaniel Bonner.Have you finished drooling yet? He's the only son of Natty Bumppo of \"The Last of the Mohicans\" fame (here called Daniel Bonner, but keeping his nickname Hawkeye as in the original) and Cora Munro, and has grown up following both the Mohawk and the white ways of life, hence one of his names is Between-Two-Worlds. He earns his living as a trapper and hunter, just like his father and Mahican adoptive grandfather, on the mountain called Hidden Wolf over the village of Paradise, which is property of Judge Middleton, the father of English schoolteacher Elizabeth, our heroine, a land he aspires to own for his family's sake and whose ownership is disputed with another Mohawk-raised white man, Dr Richard Todd, which drives the plot forward for the whole book. The key to possession of the mountain is Elizabeth, as the Judge has willed it to her on condition she marry the man he's indebted to. But she, a confirmed spinster who admires ur-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, doesn't want to marry but be a teacher and have her school built, as that is the reason for her coming to the New World. Of course, meeting Nathaniel means she has to forsake any oaths of eternal spinsterhood, for she falls in love with the widowed backwoodsman after encountering him in the most unfortunate of circumstances: an accidental shooting. But teaching isn't something she wants to give up, and with the help of Nathaniel, who's given her the hilarious nickname of Boots, she gets her school. And love. And a land of her own she can share with him. And a mixed-ethnicity family she loves. I'd say that Donati's strength is in characterisation, she's excellent at it. And, this is something I frequently remark on, both her male and female protagonists are equally compelling. To me, at least, for I loved gutsy, resourceful and smart Elizabeth as much as Nathaniel. The romance between them flows well, to my taste, they do have good chemistry, and the intimate scenes, of which there are a fair number, are not so explicit, and the most one can say is that some of them take place in . . . creative places.But if she excels at characterisation, her storytelling isn't as strong. The novel goes on and on and on and on for so long, and although I can't say I lost interest at any point (fortunately!), I definitely felt like the book was never going to end. Donati needed to have tightened up the plot in Part III especially, and edited Part II much more than she seems to have done, as those where the ones I felt were yelling for better editing. The book would've been somewhat leaner and felt less interminable as a result, also."}, {"userName": "Maggie Danniels", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50941302-maggie-danniels", "userReview": "Una gran novela, poco puedo aportar a las buena rese\u00f1as que otras lectoras han escrito.

It was closer to a bodice-ripper than it is to Outlander.It was entertaining enough, and I may, at some point, pick up the next one in the series, but the central plot, i.e. the romance between Nathaniel and Elizabeth, didn't grab me. I just didn't get it. While there were moments that Nathaniel was rather sexy (the long dark hair, the silver earring), at the end of the day, he was a backwoodsman who probably needed a bath. I just couldn't believe that a woman of Elizabeth's education would fall in love with someone who routinely used the word \"aint.\"As he has often been compared to Jamie from \"Outlander\", it is important to remember that Jamie was an educated aristocrat, the nephew of the laird of Clan MacKenzie, and a laird in his own right through his mother's land holdings. There is one scene in ITW where Nathaniel is cleaned up and dragged into town with Elizabeth to stay with the local lawyer (or it might have been the judge, I really don't remember, as there were so many peripheral characters that I couldn't keep them all straight)--in any case, Nathaniel is clearly uncomfortable dressed up at a dinner party. Whereas Jamie would have handled that type of situation with poise and charm, because that is the world that he was born to. In fact, I would have easily bought into the idea of Elizabeth falling in love with a Jamie type character, but Nathaniel... not so much.So, if you read this book without any preconceived notions that you are going to find another Jamie and Claire, you might enjoy it. If you are looking for Jamie, you will be sadly disappointed."}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "Elizabeth Middleton has a mind of her own.

Not even Ms. Gabaldon wrote the same book twice, why would another person - another author - with her own writing style and brain, and voice and ideas, want to replicate that? Sometimes I swear, people just don't make sense to me. I'd hate to read the same thing over and over again, what makes a book special is that it is unique and cannot be duplicated.Now, I adored Into the Wilderness. It was beautifully written and the fact that half the characters were Native Americans, only made the experience more exciting and interesting. I'll never repeat it enough, we don't study much about America's history, back in the Old World.I'm about to order the next books online, because this story felt like magic to me, and I can't break the spell now.

It had all the elements of a story that I would typically like: romance, nature/wilderness, drama, etc. But, the writing was just off. Here is an example of a clunky passage (two characters are making out): \"He realized that she was trying to talk to him, and he came back to himself a little. His name. She was summoning him to her. He drew it from her mouth, swallowed it whole. Gave her back her own name, fed it to her with his tongue.\"It brings imagery to mind of a mother bird regurgitating food for her babies, LOL. The writing literally varied per page--one paragraph would be great and the next paragraph would take you mentally out of the book. There was no losing oneself with this one. One of the main problems I had with the writing was the POV. You'd be reading Elizabeth's POV for pages and then suddenly it would be Nathaniel's, no break or warning. It was awkward to say the least.Again regarding the writing, the characters just weren't believable and some of the situations they were presented with were downright silly. For instance, Nathaniel has to show Elizabeth how to drink from a stream. As a woman who is nearly thirty, one would think she could figure out how to hold her hair back for the task. But, not Elizabeth. The rugged Nathaniel has to show her. *eye roll* Speaking of Nathaniel and Elizabeth, I never felt their chemistry. They just weren't believable as a couple for me and I found his moniker for her of \"Boots\" as forced and annoying.Finally, I have to comment on the inclusion of references to Outlander characters. Going into the book I thought that it could be fun, especially as I knew Diana Gabaldon had had some influence on Donati's writing (as Donati herself acknowledges in her Notes). Instead, the references felt gimmicky and, once again, forced. On the surface, Donati's writing seems as though it could be comparable to Gabaldon's, but, in actuality, it didn't even come close for me. JMHO. As all my friends on GR know, I'm a huge DG fan.For all my gripes, the book wasn't terrible and there was enough drama to make me curious as to the ending. Still, it was only 'ok' for me (2 stars).

I am a huge fan of the Outlander series and pretty much anything Diana Gabaldon decides to write so I read Into the Wilderness because of her praise and her fans' praise for this novel. And I have to say that it was just OKAY; it was not bad. The author definitely put a good amount of research into the story but it failed complexity. The characters were not as developed as they could have been and neither was the flow of the plot. Her writing style was mediocre to good. I don't know if my attitude was wrong coming into this novel, I was expecting maybe too much but Elizabeth Middleton's character was too routine. She was too much of a goody-two-shoes who did everything right without thinking twice about her actions. And everyone (except Richard Todd and Julian) and their mother just kept praising her and saying how she was such a \"strong woman.\" Again, I might be overreacting, but it was all just too SQUARE for my liking. I guess I found her character as naive despite all she experienced.I thought that the \"hero\" Bonner's character was introduced into the story MUCH too soon and much too abruptly. Everything was just obvious to be enticing. But there was excitement to it after all. I read it relatively quickly but I am hesitant to read book 2 of this series. I suppose if I grow tired of waiting for Gabaldon's next novel, and run out of other books to read I will give the sequel to Into the Wilderness a go.

Her widowed father has promised Elizabeth that she can become the schoolteacher for the local children, but on her arrival at Paradise, her father's property, she learns that he has brought her to America under false pretenses. It is his intention to find her a husband, preferably the well-respected physician, Richard Todd. Though Elizabeth has no intention to marry, she is immediately drawn, not to Richard, but to backwoodsman Nathaniel Bonner, son of Dan'l \"Hawkeye\" Bonner, hero of the James Fenimore Cooper classic. Nathaniel's connection to the Mohican (Mahican) people is a strong one; he considers Hawkeye's adoptive father, Chingachgook, his grandfather, and his own wife was a Mahican woman who died in childbirth several years earlier. Elizabeth learns from her father that her inheritance is a part of his lands, a mountain known as Hidden Wolf, to be granted to her when she marries. She soon finds herself caught between Nathaniel and the Mahicans, who want to buy back the mountain from her father as part of their hunting grounds, and Richard, who wants the land for himself and sees Elizabeth as the route to it. Her father, fearful that the sale of Hidden Wolf to the Mahicans will bring more Indians back to Paradise, favors Richard. Knowing Richard's main interest in her is her land, Elizabeth resists his attentions as she gets to know Nathaniel and his people. The backwoodsmen and their Indian friends accept her and respect her opinions, and she soon finds herself siding with their claim to Hidden Wolf. Meanwhile, the attraction between her and Nathaniel grows into a love that only adds to the conflict between the whites and the Indians. Into the Wilderness is an intelligent and beautifully written historical novel that draws the reader into another world. Elizabeth and Nathaniel are well-rounded and intelligent characters, and the secondary characters are also strong, three-dimensional, and often entertainingly quirky. Although the book is long--nearly 700 words--tight pacing makes it an entertaining read. Fans of Diana Gabaldon will want to watch for a cameo appearance by one of the characters of Gabaldon's stunning Outlander series. --Lisa Wanttaja", "title": "Into the Wilderness\n      \n          (Wilderness #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1292347.Into_the_Wilderness", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405823369l/1292347.jpg", "reviews": 1912, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/41193.Sara_Donati", "name": "Sara Donati"}], "type": ["Historical", "Romance", "Historical", "Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1292347.Into_the_Wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72854.Into_the_Wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1592485.En_tierras_lejanas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9817379-into-the-wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3067026-into-the-wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9554882-into-the-wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/820956.Dawn_on_a_Distant_Shore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72855.Lake_in_the_Clouds", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72856.Fire_Along_the_Sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72848.Queen_of_Swords", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5292764-the-endless-forest"]}
