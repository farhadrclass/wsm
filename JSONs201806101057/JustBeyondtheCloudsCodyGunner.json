I had invested so much time, energy, and emotion into getting to know Cody Gunner and Ali Daniels -- not to mention falling in love with the love story that they shared -- so I could not wait to see the plans that God had for Cody's growth in his personal relationship with Jesus Christ and his future happiness. Even though I was saddened by the fact that Cody finally took his wedding ring off and opened his heart to the possibilities of an upcoming romantic venture with Elle Dalton, I knew that he had to move passed his grief and find a way to live. After all, loss -- especially the devastating loss of a beloved spouse -- is a part of the life that we MUST EXPERIENCE while we live here on earth. Life here on earth CAN NOT and WILL NOT be perfect for any of us; thus, we will experience seasons of trial and tribulation. And...the ache of the losses that we endure will always be with us, but God's strength, grace, and wisdom can help each person learn from and move passed that time of sorrow and find TRUE happiness. :-). In Cody's case, Karen Kingsbury hinted at a second chance at romantic love with another person, but God's plans are not the same for everyone. Blessedly, though, His ways are PERFECT and COME IN HIS TIME. He knows the plans...and they ALWAYS come to pass."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1368187-cindy", "userReview": "A Beautiful Book."}, {"userName": "Lena Morrison", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28404981-lena-morrison", "userReview": "Did not like this book!"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1874807-karen", "userReview": "Another Kingsbury book in my quest to go back and read all of her books.

If you have read the book A Thousand Tomorrows you will love this one. It is the second book to the Cody Gunner series. In this book he meets a women named Elle. They both have gone through losses of marriage. Cody is a widower. His wife died from cystic fibrosis a few years back. He still would wear his wedding ring around not wanting to let go of Ali. Before Ali died she told him she wants him to get married again and be happy. This book talks about his faith along with his little brothers faith as well. It talks about the struggles his brother has with Down syndrome as well. This book is full of emotions, understanding and suspense. It also has a very happy ending.When I first started to read this book I didn\u2019t really want Cody to find someone new. Just because I really like the book before \u201cA Thousand Tomorrows\u201d I was attached to the other character that he fell in love with Ali. Then I started reading more and once I got more into it I realized Elle was just as sweet. I really enjoyed this book because I like romance. I also liked learning about the struggles families and people have with Down syndrome. A lot of people don\u2019t understand what they go through so it was very interesting. Karen Kingsbury is an amazing author. She is a Christian writer too that\u2019s what I like about her. She really gets your attention and keeps you hooked. I honestly do the like the book \u201cA Thousand Tomorrows\u201d just a little bit more because I like hearing about all that rodeo stuff and there\u2019s not much of it in \u201cJust Beyond The Clouds\u201d. They both are good books, but before you read this one be sure to read a thousand tomorrows that way it will make a lot more sense. This writer has written lots more books that I\u2019m sure are just as good, so be good to check them out."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4371743-candace", "userReview": "This was interesting for me. I have mainly only read Lori Wick in the category of Christian romantic fiction, so I was unused to Kingsbury's style. That being said, I wasn't as drawn to the characters and some of the story. The parts concerning Carl Joseph and Daisy I found fascinating. I appreciate her portrayal of people with Down Syndrome; she didn't make them caricatures or oversize children. She showed that they are people as well with limitations. The romance between Carl Joseph and Daisy, I feel, was the real romance of the novel. Sweet, innocent love like that is rare to find and truly to be valued. The relationship between Elle and Cody was understanably different. I wasn't as invested and I enjoyed it but I wasn't avidly rooting for them. I appreciated the situations they had gone through, even though more attention appeared to be on Cody's past. This apparently is because he is a recurring character from a novel centered around his past relationship. Elle's fiance's secret was really interesting and not something I have come across before in this genre. In the beginning, I really disliked Cody. I thought him pigheaded and foolish when it came to Carl Joseph's capabilities. I came to understand and like him better as the novel went on, however. I was really excited to read this. My excitement wasn't fully justified but I thought it decent. Don't know if I would recommend it, if so, only because of Carl Joseph and Daisy. I think everyone should read about them :-)"}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3457830-denise", "userReview": "I really enjoy Karen Kingsbury books. The stories and dialogue flow so easily that I find them a pleasure to read. This book is a follow-up to her earlier book A Thousand Tomorrows. It involves Cody Gunner, a professional rodeo bull rider and his brother, Carl Joseph, who has Down's Syndrome. Cody has a lot of trouble accepting that his brother could learn to be self-sufficient. Cody battles Elle, Carl Joseph's teacher, in an attempt to protect his brother from what he perceives as the inherent dangers of independent living for his Buddy. The themes involved here include recovery after emotional set-backs, trusting others and trusting God to help in times of trouble. This book provided some interesting information about Down's Syndrome and what persons with that condition are actually capable of doing. I would recommend it to my fellow book club members."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1496920-brittany", "userReview": "Karen Kingsbury, who is the author of Just Beyond the Clouds, wrote a beautiful love story.
