However, this book is truly original: I don't think anyone has ever written a \"prequel\", if you will, to the origins of angels. So in that, this book stands alone, while staying true to the historical/mythological origins of the characters in both their personality and powers to create a world that is original, imaginative, magical, mystical and compelling. As a sci-fi, fantasy novel, this book has it all: action, adventure, romance, mysticism, wisdom, and more. But I would caution any reader who has an aversion to spirituality (the lore that shaped this novel is based largely in Christian mystical writings about angels). So if Christian themes and symbolism offend, this is not the book for you. For everyone else, I believe this novel will resonate on some really deep levels for you. Here's the synopsis: Earth's ancient heroes and man's oldest and most dreaded foe collide in the greatest epic saga ever known to man. BEFORE their race became the mystical beings we now call angels, they ruled the earth as mortals in an age of mystery. Gabrius, a humble stargazer and astronomer must decipher cryptic messages as ancient as the universe itself to unravel the growing corruption of the Lightbringer before he is overtaken by the greatest villain of all time. The world as we know it hangs in the balance as one man learns to follow his heart against impossible odds and discover his true power and a destiny that has since become legend. As the Lightbringer's power grows, the seven high Seraphim must hone their unique mystical abilities to lead the fight for all they hold true and rise to meet their destiny as heroes of legend to prevent the cataclysmic end of their race's reign on earth. In a rich, epic adventure that gives new wings to the original war between good and evil, we unlock answers to some of the greatest mysteries of the ages and catch a unique glimpse into the secrets of the unseen realms.Thanks for reading everyone. My heartfelt thanks. Please write a review and vote for EOTB on lists."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24736482-dave", "userReview": "This book needs to become a movie! Not to give away too much with spoilers - but the scene near the end when everyone is fighting together and everyone has their powers was awesome. A little critique - as a Christian reader, I heard it was a Christian fantasy book and at first i was wondering where the Christian influence was. But it is definitely in there as you read on - but not in a way that you wouldn't like it if you aren't a Christian. I think the writer did a good job taking this topic, which is Classically Christian and making it accessible for everyone. Christians really attacked Tolkien for having magic and things in the Lord of the Rings - but that is what made it accessible for all audiences. This book is kind of like that. It started with more mysticism and stuff like that but got more and more inspirational as you read. Again, slight spoiler but when Gabrius goes forward in time and meets \"the teacher\"... i cried. the whole book kind of builds like that. The inspiration builds. The action builds. The romance angle builds (but not over the top). Definitely worth a read."}, {"userName": "Caroline \u00c5sg\u00e5rd", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19812841-caroline-sg-rd", "userReview": "I only read the four chapter sample, but I still wanted to say what I thought about it.So this is supposedly a book about angels, but already from the start we are told that it's not the same as other stories.We meet both good and evil, we get to see pictures of the flower of life, the tree of life and maps of stars and the history of this universe, which I appreciated a lot.Suddenly our good hero Helel is transported to the chaos of the modern world (has the dark lord anything to do with this?), and danger calls.So yeah, this seems like a good book, with some religion and mythology mixed into it, in its own unique way."}, {"userName": "Jean Miller", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28189612-jean-miller", "userReview": "This innovative novel does an intriguing job creating a world before we know it with characters that had a lot of personality and depth. I've read other angel books that had really wooden, static characters and I was surprised how much I liked the characters, the story and the concept. Well done & a great read. I couldn't put it down."}, {"userName": "Gaute", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8661082-gaute", "userReview": "Loved this book."}, {"userName": "Muez", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30988598-muez", "userReview": "like writing for me"}, {"userName": "Americanenglishexper", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50861446-americanenglishexper", "userReview": "great.
