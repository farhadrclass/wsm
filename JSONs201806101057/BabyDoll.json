Why do I keep doing this to myself? I only end up disappointed.I have to wonder if the person that wrote the blurb for this book has even read either of those books. I would have to say not, because there is no comparison. Aside from the first few chapters, there is nothing surprising about this plot. There is no shocking revelation or exceptional plot twist that makes this a standout. Not in my eyes, at least.I totally get this is a work of fiction. That this scenario is not real. But as a reader there has to be some plausibility for me to enjoy the story. I didn\u2019t walk away from this book thinking that anyone in Lily\u2019s situation would act the way she did. After 8 years or 3,110 days of captivity, it would take more than a day before anyone could handle the nuances of real life or subjecting themselves to public scrutiny. She would have had years of trauma to overcome.What bothered me the most was how the author chose to tell the story. Rather than giving us first hand experience or letting us live through the eyes of the characters, we\u2019re simply told about what happened secondhand. She chose to let us live through the boring, humdrum, everyday events instead. Things that didn\u2019t really add much of anything to the story. It felt so surface. There was no depth to the characters or connection to the story for me. Aside from all that, it was the over-the-top quality of the story that ultimately cemented this as a two star read for me. The author flitted from one contrived event to the next. There was no character building or development of the story. For this reader, it was too much. It was overdone. Take this for what it is - my opinion. I was looking forward to reading this book, but it wasn\u2019t one that worked for me. If you are expecting Gone Girl greatness, I would reconsider picking this one up. \n*ARC provided by Redhook Books and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Chelsea Humphrey", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey", "userReview": "Find all my reviews on my blog at: https://thesuspenseisthrillingme.comDate Read: 07/18/16Pub Date: 07/12/163 STARS\u201cFor fans of Gone Girl and Girl on the Train, Baby Doll is the most tense thriller you will read this year.Held captive for eight years, Lily has grown from a teenager to an adult in a small basement prison. Her daughter Sky has been a captive her whole life. But one day their captor leaves the deadbolt unlocked.This is what happens next\u2026\u2026to her twin sister, to her mother, to her daughter\u2026and to her captor.\u201dNot a lot to go on right? Notice that little blurb at the top- \u201cFor fans of Gone Girl and Girl on the Train\u2026\u201d. Stop right there. This is an EXTREMELY unfair comparison as this book in no way was similar to those aforementioned. I think a good number of lukewarm to poor reviews of this book are due to the fact the reader felt duped into believing that they were picking up a book that was arresting with at least 1 or more major plot twists. Unfortunately, I was one of those readers, which made me feel a little guilty as I believe part of my reasoning behind a lower rating was due to feeling misled. If you want my personal opinion, this was more relatable to the novel Room by Emma Donoghue than anything else (I loved that book by the way), if it had been written involving the aftermath of the kidnapping. To end my initial rant, if this book had been marketed to a different crowd, it would be receiving a higher overall rating, but that\u2019s just my opinion.Another thing to note is that this book isn\u2019t about Lily\u2019s captivity, not really. After a glowing first few chapters that had me hooked, we are thrown into the aftermath and what life is like for herself and her family of everyday life. The ending did speed up a bit once again, but the middle was just a little meh. I thought there would be more thrilling action, but it was just domestic drama that seemed a bit trite compared to the premise of Lily being held captive for 8 years. While not going into the plot too deeply, Lily seemed a bit normal, like she hadn\u2019t experienced daily, overwhelming trauma for almost a decade. I was expecting turmoil and struggles, but she seemed just fine.I know this sounds like nothing but a giant bash-this-book post, but I promise its not. Hollie Overton clearly is a talented writer, I just wasn\u2019t the right reader for this book. My tastes are slightly different, so I was expecting this to be told and read from a completely different angle. This is a classic case of \u201cI enjoyed reading this book, it just wasn\u2019t one I\u2019ll be remembering for years to come\u201d. I can say with confidence that I would be interested in reading the author\u2019s next book, as I feel she has tremendous potential and would love to watch her growth from book to book. I don\u2019t give out 3 star ratings if I don\u2019t enjoy the book, so please take this for what it is-simply my opinion.*I\u2019d like to thank the publisher for providing my copy in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Update: 10-23-16. Kindle book $2.99. Not sure for how long.\n***MILD SPOILERS***--->EXCERPT<---A dead bolt has a very specific sound. Lily was an expert at recognizing certain sounds--the creak of the floorboards signaling his arrival, the mice scurrying across the concrete in search for food. But Lily always braced herself for the sound of the dead bolt, listening as metal scraped against the metal. The lock as beginning to rust, so it always took him several tries. But inevitably, she would hear the click, the sound that meant they were trapped for another week, another month, another year. But tonight, she heard nothing. Only deafening silence. Hours passed, and she couldn't stop thinking about the lock.Lily has was taken when she was sixteen by someone that was a prominent person in the community. His name is Rick. He kept her in the basement of his cabin in the woods for eight years. This is where she also gave birth to their child Sky from the multiple rapes from Rick. She suffered a lot of abuse in the little basement. But one time... just one time.. he forgets to latch the lock. RUN RUN RUN.. FREE FREE FREE...I was so nervous that Lily and Sky weren't going to make it. I thought it would be some sick joke. But it was a harsh reality when Lily realized how close to home she actually was and that's even scarier. The book is told from multiply POVs. You have Lily, Rick (evil man), Eve (Lily's Mom) and Abby (Lily's twin sister.) They all have important parts to play in the book. Abby has pined for her twin sister ever since she was taken. She kept telling people that Lily was still alive and she was right when Lily shows up on the doorstep with Sky. Abby has a very volatile temper. She's very protective of Lily and she does a very good job in my opinion. But there is one thing that Abby is afraid for Lily to know. She doesn't want to hurt her. I won't get into all of that, you can read the book. As you can figure, the family goes through a lot of stuff. They have to face the trial with Rick and let me tell you... I did not see that coming. It was so wonderful and maybe I shouldn't say that but I felt that way. Sometimes people get what they deserve that the justice system just can't do for themselves. At first I was torn between a three star or what because at first the book did sound similar to another book. But then the book took off in another direction and I really enjoyed it. Okay if I confess the part that turned me around was in the courtroom and what lovely feelings revenge can make you feel against someone that hurts women. There was a great happily ever after as well as their should be in this case. *I would like to thank Netgalley and Redhook Books for a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.*MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Arah-Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859453-arah-lynda", "userReview": "As the story opens Lily and her daughter Sky are being held captive in the basement of a cabin set deep in the woods. \u00a0Their captor has, for the first time in eight long years, neglected to lock the door. \u00a0Ever apprehensive that this may be just another, in a long list of tests that Rick, her captor, has set for her, Lily gathers up Sky and takes her first shaky step toward freedom.Soaked in fear and swimming in adrenaline, once Lily is able to get her bearings she realizes that she has been close to home all this time. \u00a0What unfolds then is Lily\u2019s journey back to her former life. \u00a0Except we all know that is no longer possible. \u00a0Held captive for eight years and clutching her daughter, a product of that same captivity, Lily\u2019s former life is forever gone.Lily has a twin sister, Abby and this story is as much about the bond between Lily and her sister as it is about Lily\u2019s struggle to get home, or at least today\u2019s closest proximity to home. \u00a0I confess that I have never really understood that twin thing, that bond you hear so much about, but I had a real struggle identifying with most of the actions and decisions employed by both Lily and Abby. \u00a0\u00a0There were times when, especially early on, I questioned the plausibility of what happened. \u00a0Narrated by four perspectives: that of Eve (the twins mother), Lily, Abby and Lily\u2019s abductor Rick, the reader is privy to what happened eight years ago, the impact it had on those left behind and what unfolds for each of these characters once Lily returns. \u00a0I really think the premise held huge promise, so much fertile soil to excavate that was sadly left untapped. \u00a0Oddly enough it was the four main characters that seemed so very shallow and not fully developed. \u00a0I found I could relate better to some of the other cast members like Wes, Lily\u2019s one time suitor and Abby\u2019s current lover. \u00a0Lily\u2019s daughter Sky was another lost opportunity and even though she was most often there in the midst of things, her presence felt more like background d\u00e9cor.

Although we don't have in-depth details of her time in captivity, we know that she has been both physically, and mentally abused during that time, and has also given birth to her daughter Sky, who was fathered by her captor.The opening chapter is where we first meet Lily and Sky. It begins with their escape from their basement hell - a windowless room with no contact with the outside world. To say this first chapter is heart pounding is an understatement. The disbelief that Lily has, that she might finally be free, and the stomach churning fear that her abductor will return to stop her is almost unbearable. But luck is on her side, and she and Sky make it back to her family home. But if you think it's all going to be moonlight and roses, and happy ever after, then think again. The aftermath is anything but smooth, with the whole family thrown into turmoilThe storyline was very good, with lots of tension and a twist that I never saw coming till it hit me between the eyes!

It doesn't have any correlation to Gone Girl or Girl on The Train in any way shape or form.This is a the author's first book, and you can read the signs throughout. Underdeveloped characters, sophomoric writing style, and pointless story lines just made this a mess for me to read. Example Eve: I'm not sure why she was given dedicated chapters and what her infidelity had to do with anything?The only chapters I looked forward to were those for Rick-the essential bad guy. But even those made me cringe at times at the absurdity of his thoughts and actions.This was almost a DNF, but I was curious to see if the ending would provide any better entertainment, and unfortunately it didn't.If you are looking for a good suspense novel, keep looking as this isn't it.

The synopsis made it sounds fabulous. I quickly felt that the book was not giving me the buzz factor that a book in this genre should.A young woman has been held captive, tortured, raped and beaten against her will by a man she should have been able to trust. Locked away for years one day she realises she can run for her freedom...and she does.The story then concentrates on how things are with her integrating back with her family including her twin sister and a lot has happened in the years she was hidden away. But she's alive and wants to bring her captor to justice.The execution was not great, there are a lot of long-winded pages and chapters where situations drag out unnecessarily. It slows the book down a lot. The start of the book is great, it's exciting and the end of the book has the thrills and twists also. Sadly the middle of the book was just very lukewarm with fairly forgettable moments.I wanted more depth, rawness and human grief from the characters. There has been so much damage done but at times it's like it's brushed over too lightly in my opinion.I give Baby Doll 3 stars, great plot and if there was more pace, less wordiness and more shocks through the book this would have been facts drug!

I was very disappointed to read that so many people didn't enjoy it. So the only way to find out for myself was to read it straight away. I know now where most people are coming from. I too would have liked to read more about Lily's time in captivity (being the dark and twisted person I am) especially when she refers to the 'training' period Rick put her through at the beginning of the abduction. Perhaps there could have been flashback chapters interweaved with the story? The book covers the immediate aftermath of Lily's escape and although the first couple of chapters were quite tense after that it just became a mundane book. Saying that, I did still enjoy it, I never wanted to put it down and although I cant ever personally understand the bond between twins or even just having a sibling the connection between Lily and Abby was ultimately what controlled the book and the finale to the story. As long as you're not looking for a twisted deep psychological thriller and looking more for a safe read then you will still enjoy \"Baby Doll\" and I maybe would read her next book due out this year.

There was a lot of drama all throughout as the characters do their best to overcome a really horrific situation. I found myself completely engaged in this story rather early on even though a part of me questioned the characterization in this read. Lily who had been held captive really seemed to be the strongest character in the book but I suppose there's no right way for anyone to react to something horrible. I gave up questioning the personalities fairly quickly though and just sat back and enjoyed the ride through the twists and turns and ended up really liking the story in the end.

In any case, I was expected, if nothing else, to be gripped by a creepily engaging story. Unfortunately, this feeling vacillated quite a bit. The book is told in various POVs and certain ones are definitely more interesting than others, leading me to lose interest in chunks of the book, while it picked up for others. Also, while obviously feeling for the victims of this story, I never connected to any of the characters, which tends to downgrade a book in my eyes. I don't need lovely characters I want to be best friends with (though it's always wonderful if that is the case), but I do need characters who can hold my attention. Another little niggle is that there were so many occasions when this book reminded me so much of ROOM by Emma Donaghue, which was quite excellent, and I'm afraid BABY DOLL suffered in the comparison.Overton does have a good way of writing, with flowing dialogue and the multiple POVs are done smoothly, which is certainly a skill! I also wanted to know the outcome of the story, even if the characters weren't quiet doing it for me, so I kept reading. I was surprised by the ending, though I'm not sure I liked it.

Although it wasn't a classic and there were a few holes in the plot, I still enjoyed it.Lily has been held captive for eight years and now she seizes an opportunity to escape with her daughter Sky. Lily was kidnapped by Rick, a local teacher who for the last eight years has abused Lily both sexually and mentally while keeping her locked up. On escaping she manages to get back home where she finds her family has carried on without her, her father is now dead and her first love is about to become the father of her twin sister Abby's baby. This all happens in the opening few pages and the rest of the book deals with the aftermath of these events.The alternates between the main characters as they give their accounts giving an insight into their part in the story.Yes the novel could have been better written and yes like I said the plot could have been more water tight but it is still a good read and every book doesn't have to be an absolute classic to be entertaining.I would like to thank Net Galley and Random House for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for a honest review."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18894476-sarah", "userReview": "This book could have been been a lot better in my opinion. It wasn't bad and I didn't throw it across the room, it was just ok. I know it's received different kinds of reviews, so don't be discouraged about reading it if it sounds like you would enjoy it. The story line is good, just not realistic in places. I don't believe someone could go through what the main character did, and then take up life like she did. It just didn't work for me."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Had to DNF this one at 60% hence no rating- the writing is great by the way but the story did not grab me personally. I liked the original premise but for ME it was heavy on melodrama. I think this will be a stand out read for a lot of lovers of pyschological thrillers who like something a bit different. Sadly for whatever odd reason did not resonate with my reading head."}, {"userName": "Tori (InToriLex)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10584748-tori-intorilex", "userReview": "Find this and other Reviews at In Tori LexI was concerned when I started this book because there was ALOT of exposition within the first few chapters. But the changing of perspectives in the novel and suspense sucked me in. The novel rotates between the perspective of Lily the protagonist, her twin sister Abby, Eve her mom and Rick her captor. The multiple perspectives worked well because they were mostly between the two sisters. The author did a great job of making me care and root for Lily and Abby, who are very different but completely devoted to each other. The bond that exists between the twins was one of the best I've seen described, probably because the author is a twin herself. \n\"Each day, he'd taught her how to be a little less human. And now, everything she'd learned from him would be his undoing.\" \nThis is a story of redemption, but it describes Lily getting her life together in a realistic way. Lily makes mistakes along the way and has to let go of the years she lost while being helped captive. The people around her also have understandably moved on with life, and have to readjust to having her back. Lily's captor Rick is clearly a psychopath but I liked getting a glimpse into his thoughts and experiences. The other characters are also fleshed out well, so no part of this book felt like filler. I felt a full range of emotions while reading, which is what good books do.\n\n\nTowards the end of the book things took a turn from how I thought it would go. The suspense was great and I couldn't read fast enough. This was a wonderful thriller, and I was pleasantly surprised by the author's ability to make the story different than the usual woman held captive narrative we've all been subjected too many times. I would recommend this book to adult readers who enjoy suspense and characters you can cheer for."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "I was a bit wary about this book when I started to read it. I didn\u2019t read any other reviews on Goodreads, but had noticed a string of 2 stars so was a bit worried about it. I have to say though that, with some reservations, I did enjoy this fast paced story about Lily and her six year old daughter Sky. At the very start of the read Lily manages to escape from the \u201cdungeon\u201d in which she has been kept captive for the past 8 years and we follow her return to daily life. Whilst her family have always loved her, missed her and are overjoyed at her return, we soon discover that their lives are very different now and Lily is in for some surprises as she gets accustomed to life on the outside.There are an awful lot of stories around with this premise. A few weeks ago, a neighbour was looking through my bookshelf for a holiday read and it seemed that for nearly every book he asked about, I said \u201cOh, that\u2019s about a woman who has been abducted by a nutter and kept in confinement for years and years and years \u2026\u201d He started to look at me a little weirdly in the end and that was only my paperback collection \u2013 if he only knew what was on my Kindle! This one didn\u2019t really go into a great deal of detail about Lily\u2019s time in captivity and the story starts when she gets out, and so I never totally felt as if I should ever have been worried about her. What we do hear about that time, tends to give mixed messages about her life. Yes, it was brutal but there seemed to be some strange complicated relationship going on with her abductor that didn\u2019t quite come through in the read.There are a lot of viewpoints explored in this story and each one does add to the read although I would have liked to have read something from Sky\u2019s point of view- a little girl entering the outside world for the first time; the bewilderment, excitement and overload of stimulation.As I would expect from an author who is used to writing for TV, it is a fast moving, pacy read and in all fairness, I have to say that overall I did really enjoy reading it. I received a review copy from the publisher via Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Louise Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42343152-louise-wilson", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Lily has held captive for eight years in a small basement prison. Her daughter Sky has been held captive all her life. One day Lily & Sky get the lucky break Lily has waited for - her captor has forgot to lock the door when they left. What happens next to her twin sister, to her mother, to her daughter and to her captor......In some instances this book is predictable.

You too could have the \"pleasure\" of meeting some creep who keeps a girl in a basement for a long time only to have her escape when he does something dumb. You too will most likely predict the cliched ending before you're done with the first paragraph of chapter one. You too will recall other, better, thrillers that actually say something that sets them apart from the eighty gazillion other books just like it. You too will think to yourself \"well that was an astronomical waste of my time and attention!\"Nothing to see here folks.

During her time held in a basement, she gave birth to a daughter, Sky. 8 years after her abduction, her captor suddenly leaves a deadbolt unlocked one day and Lily escapes. Told from the point of views of Lily, her twin sister, Abby, her mother, Eve, and her captor, Rick, Baby Doll is about the aftermath of Lily's and Sky's escape. Abby's and Eve's lives have changed dramatically during Lily's absence. Rick's capture and the ensuing media pressure are taking a toll on everyone involved. Getting justice and adapting to a 'normal' life is far from straightforward for Lily and her family.The compelling premise of Baby Doll and the marketed promise of a tense thriller drew me to this book. But sadly it didn't live up to its promise. It was lacking in tension and thrills. While the plot was interesting and I enjoyed some aspects of it, it didn't really grip me as a tense thriller would. Everything was a bit too easy and simplistic. The characters lacked any real depth and left me feeling lukewarm towards them. The ending was too sweet for me. But it was a pleasant enough read.In my opinion, the way the book is being advertised isn't helping. If you are going into this expecting something similar to THOSE Girl books, I think you'll be disappointed. However, if you like women's fiction with a little dramatic edge to it, you'll probably enjoy this more.
