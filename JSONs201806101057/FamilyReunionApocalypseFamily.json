Each character felt individual and not clones of one another. Different beliefs, goals, emotions. Excellent.Plenty of action, and realistic character reactions. Nothing gunghow and unlike 90% of the ZA books I've read, the creatures were never really regarded as evil. Characters struggled with personal battles throughout the book.

This book kept me swiping pages. I was absolutely invested in the characters. I still am. They are like family to me. I need to know what happened to them. Most of the time I can guess who survives but this author isn't afraid to kill anyone. You really are left worrying about who is making it. You worry about those who are going back to find family. Will they make it? What will they find? What happens next? Dang it! I need to know! I just missed the authors deadline on getting the next book and it kills me. I want to already be reading it, not waiting on my book budget. The author knows his firepower and you will too. He also knows a lot about the transportation the characters use. I suspect he thoroughly researched at least two modes of transportation. He gives an amazingly detailed description of the Marathon Coach, (that I now want more than anything). I don't even care if he made up stuff in that baby. I want one because of him. The author had me drooling on some of the weapons, too. He was just as thorough with them. One thing I love and found super helpful, (though it is at the back of the book), is the author gives us a characters bio. I suspect I will be using this with future books. There are also diagrams of the Marathon Coach, (apparently I wasn't drooling enough), and the Tokitae which will help you picture things. In the story, where they are first mentioned, there is a link that will take you back and forth so you can have a picture in your head for the author's descriptions. There is a lot of action and gore in the book. If you aren't expecting that and don't want it, I'm not sure why you are here, (though you need not worry about sexual activity. The author doesn't have anyone graphically doing the deed while a horde is attacking). I am expecting even more action as the series goes on, (for those wanting the deed while the horde gathers, I am suspecting that might pop up. Even the Walking Dead went there.), and more gore. I would definitely recommend this book to zombie fans. Though I will caution you that these are the authors view of zombies, (and an interesting view it is), not Romero's. Check it out and see for yourself."}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "My original Family Reunion: When The Apocalypse Happens Only One Thing Matters, Family audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.A zombie-like virus that was the result of overzealous pharmaceutical companies is ripping through the United States. All of this is happening while the Bryant family are traveling from all over to get to the greater Seattle area to meet up for a family reunion. They are thrown into the mix of these \u201cdiseased/zombies\u201d while they attempt to find each other, hoping that everyone makes it. Thankfully this family is incredibly adept at surviving.Narration was done by Joseph C. Wilson who does a wonderful job with this story. Yes, I wish that there were more voices, but that\u2019s nearly impossible to do with just how many characters there are within this story. The quality was perfect and his voice is wonderful to listen to.So, I mentioned earlier that there are a lot of characters. There are so many characters that the author has a disclaimer at the intro of this book with a link to his website where you can read all of the character bios to hopefully help you keep up with all of them throughout the story.Now, normally having this many people to follow and understand would take away from the story, but I think that DeBryan did a wonderful job pulling all of their stories together into this mosaic explaining what was going on with the outbreak throughout the United States. You get to see the outbreak from many different viewpoints and see how it affects different people differently.Normally, with an apocalyptic tale like this, you get one (or maybe one small family) outlook on what is happening in the world around them. With Family Reunion, you get a ton! Which leads to an incredibly unique story.Overall, once you wrap your brain around the different family members and each one of their stories, this is a well-written telling of an apocalyptic situation. The interweaving of the stories made this book for me.Audiobook was provided for review by the author."}, {"userName": "Denise Keef", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7004267-denise-keef", "userReview": "I have to admit, the title and cover are what drew me to read this book. When I saw a picture of the cover, it reminded me of all the family reunions we had in a park when I was young with a shelter very similar. After I read the blurb I was drawn into reading it even more! So with Kindle in hand, I sat down to read the story of a HUGE family, who were getting together after many years to catch up with each other. What happens as each group tries to reach the reunion area with a South African Flu epidemic starting takes the reader on one helluva journey! Coming by plane, car, boat and motor coach, each family group is met with obstacles along the way mostly caused by the \u201cScreamers\u201d, \u201cFreaks\u201d, \u201cCrazies\u201d or whatever name a particular group calls them and it doesn\u2019t matter what they are called because they are all flesh eating killers who once were normal human beings who were turned into these monsters by a virus! With a large cast of characters that are necessary to the story in their own way, the author brings them all to life with details that make them not just a character but someone who you feel a kinship to. I have to admit, there were a lot of scenes in this story that made me scream out, actually cry and swear at the author for what had happened! This is one of those stories where no one is safe and not everyone makes it. The story moves along with a smooth flow and a lot of excitement and action along with some comical relief along the way and I found myself devouring the whole book in a short time even though it is over three hundred pages. Yes, this is an amazing tale that not only kept me entertained but has me wanting more and I look forward to reading more in this series. Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Family Reunion and join this family on their trip that started out as a fun time but ended with their world being turned upside down\u2026you won\u2019t be disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Leslie Bryant", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41589872-leslie-bryant", "userReview": "The characters are all part of a large family trying to make it to an island in Washington for a reunion.

We made eye contact across a crowded aisle, he offered me a free book mark, and well, you know how these things turn out. I purchased both books in the series and throughly enjoyed Family Reunion.While he does go a bit Game of Thrones with the number of characters to keep track of it, didn't detract from the story for me. He does a great job of tying up all the loose ends and giving the story a more than satisfying ending even with the large family milling around the countryside.I loved the level of detail the author put into the story. While I'm I'm not quite that into the culture portrayed in the book, I like having that much information to soak up. It helped to get me into the story and pulled me along with the characters. I also like the reason he chose as to what creates the vectors. The whole idea of a creation of a creature like that from a random virus was something I've always had a hard time with. Combine that with the fact that they're usually dead but still ambulatory has always been a bit of deal breaker for me. DeBryan has put forward a much more plausible scenario that I could easily go with and enjoy.If you enjoy zombies or apocalypse stories, you'll enjoy Family Reunion!"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1193427-lori", "userReview": "Interesting take...I had no idea what to expect before I read this and am glad I went for it.As I read this, but was away from the book, the term Christian Apocalypse went through my head repeatedly. I loved how there was very little profanity and what there was , was so-called minor. Add to that the lack of drinking and the strong love of family; I wanted to meet this family!I'm from the Northwest and could almost follow the roads and picture the island. You could tell the author has a love of the location and a wonderful way to draw a picture with words.The story is a different take on the zombie thing and is actually believable. The humanity that the characters have for the sick is a refreshing change and yet they still have a sense of self preservation. Their way of surviving is enjoyable to read and their final living situation is fun(ny) and unique to Puget Sound.My only complaint? The comment earlier in the story about people in Washington State don't wear shorts outside of summer. Wrong! We are the shorts with hoodies and socks with Birkenstocks country.Good story!

There were a lot of characters 39 but Mr.P Mark DeBryan did a good job to help you keep them straight. He lumped the 7 kids of the Brent family and their spouses, kids and grandkids into groups. You followed each family group and the events that impacted them along the way.There were also a few cousins Maddie (Molly) & Harry, Thomas was with them at the Coach factory and is an engineer he became an important part of the group. One of the strays the Brent family took in was Deric ,Parker took him in after his family was dead to help keep this kid alive.Not all of the family made it. Some died from the vaccine and others were taken out by the infected. When they worked together they succeeded. You follow them as they learn to survive. Not many of the Brent family were young chicks. Some were well past 60 yrs of age.This was a well thought out story with believable struggles and realistic family dynamics. The characters were well rounded.

The family is getting together for a reunion when all hell breaks loose.

Family members arrive a few at a time while others worry about the ones still missing. This is a great story of what is most important when the unthinkable happens: FAMILY.

The story starts fast and just keeps going, once you start it you wont be able to put it down. Really liked how Mark alternated between different groups of the family so we could experience the trials they went through to reach each other.

The titles says it all as a family decide to gather for a family reunion, the first in many years. The immediate family is large, several brothers and sisters, close growing up they have attempted to stay in touch through the years. And for the most part succeed but as they have gotten older and each with their own families it has gotten harder. So they decide it's time for a family reunion which might be the last for man of them. There are many members/groups start a day prior or on the day of the outbreak and they find themselves in are a struggle to survive in a world suddenly turned upside down. And while they have a hard time understanding what is happening to those that have turned, family members included, they do what they must to survive and each decide to head to their original destination hoping other members will be there as well. There are several groups traveling north from all across the country and the story skips from one group to the other chronicling their journey. Surprisingly I had no trouble keeping them in order or knowing which group was who mainly because the author gives you brief backgrounds on the members of each group. Their journey is anything but easy, safe or sure but this is one determined family and each group does what they must to make it to the reunion place. It's very well written with a steady pace that will keep you on the edge of our seat and looking forward to the next installment. (On a side note, I would like to thank John O'Brien when he featured several fan fiction shorts based on A NEW WORLD:UNTOLD STORIES. Mr. DeBryan's short is featured in the first of the UNTOLD STORIES book. If you have not read the full A NEW WORLD series you really won't be at a loss because this is a separate account of those events. But I do urge you to pick up the series because it is a great series)."}, {"userName": "Brian's Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4289722-brian-s-book-blog", "userReview": "Check out this and all my reviews at Brian's Book BlogSometimes All You Need Is FamilyA deadly virus rips through the United States leaving members of the Bryant family stranded or looking for shelter. They were all attempting to get to a family reunion near Seattle, Washington. Thankfully, this family is incredibly adept at survival. Join each family member as they attempt to find safety in numbers and each other in Family Reunion.The narration for this was done by Joseph C. Wilson \u2014 while I\u2019ve never listened to any other novels that he\u2019s voiced, I did enjoy his narration a lot. Wilson gives a nice edge to each character and my only complaint was that there wasn\u2019t enough differentiation between characters in his voices. Granted there are a TON of characters to voice, so I can\u2019t fault him that much.Given the insane amount of characters (there are so many that the author has included a disclaimer at the beginning of the novel telling readers that he knows there are a lot), the book still has a pretty nice flow to it. Now, at times I found myself thinking \u201cwho am I following now?\u201d or \u201cwait, which person is this?\u201d but the author does have a nice description of each character on his website.Now I know that he was going for a family reunion feel \u2013 with lots of families from all over \u2014 I just know a lot of people would find this to be extremely hard to follow, especially in audiobook form, because there is no way of telling who\u2019s who right away. Even with all of that I still found myself enjoying this book. The different family members from different areas with different background really helped to create a nice narrative of the disease/plague that was spreading across the US.Overall, if you can wrap your head around the number of family members and each of their stories \u2014 this was a really unique telling of an apocalyptic moment in time.
