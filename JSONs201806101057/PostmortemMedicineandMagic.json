Plenty of sequel\u2019s drop the ball and don\u2019t live up to the first book. That is NOT the case for POSTMORTEM. POSTMORTEM is an even better book than FLATLINE is, and it keeps the characters and the story of Medicine and Magic going strong.Kate being an ER doctor trying to complete her residency is what drew me to the Medicine and Magic series. There were plenty of ER scenes in FLATLINE and those were some of the highlights of the book. However, the plot of FLATLINE focused on Kate being a doctor, not on the ER. The plot of POSTMORTEM revolves around some crazy magical occurrences happening while Kate is working at the ER. POSTMORTEM is exactly what I hoped Medicine and Magic would bring to urban fantasy, a fresh breath of air and a new perspective for a main character.My only complaint about FLATLINE was the magic system, almost nothing was explained about how the magic worked. People just threw around spells or pulled on raw magic. POSTMORTEM gives a little more in depth description of the magic system. Kate has ignored her magic her whole life and tried not to learn about it, so since the story is told through her eyes, there didn\u2019t seem to be any solid rules to the magic system. As Kate learns more about how magic work, we get so understand the magic system in the Medicine and Magic series more. It is still far from a true hard magic system, but there\u2019s a little less handwavium in POSTMORTEM.The world of Medicine and Magic also continues to grow in POSTMORTEM, Kate learns that the veil is in place to hold back more than just demons. In addition to that she discovers much more about her own magic and many hints about where it might come from. And once again, all this information is provided to us, the readers, without any info dumping.POSTMORTEM took a slightly different turn then I expected when it comes to the romance that was slowly building up in FLATLINE, and I loved it. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything so I won\u2019t say any more, except to state that the romance in POSTMORTEM follows in the slow burn fashion, staying far away from the insta-lust I dread.POSTMORTEM continues the great Medicine and Magic series, improving the world building and magic system, and enhancing the story and characters from FLATLINE. I highly recommend this series, and can\u2019t wait for the next book."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5052917-maggie", "userReview": "Still fun."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61139486-tina", "userReview": "Okay This could be a better story. It has enough of a story line to be so, even if it is one that is rather overdone. The Mc is aggravating to me in the way she doesn\u2019t learn all she can about her magic. Also says the same thing over and over and over. That gets really old. And the thing with Aron. I have to wonder how he became an archer because I never see him do anything except get incapacitated all the time. I\u2019m interested enough to check out the next book though. Hopefully won\u2019t have to read the same thing over and over, and more will happen instead of just introspection all the time."}, {"userName": "Sarah Leenart", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12554142-sarah-leenart", "userReview": "Kate is having a hard time sticking to her resolve of no magic and to be honest I wanted to boot her up the backside and say get on with it! However it all adds up to who she is and the journey towards accepting her magic is what is keeping me reading! Delving deeper into the word of the the Veil and those who inhabit it, this was a kick ass story full of action and intrigue. Fresh, original and a can't put me down plot, honestly I am really enjoying these books and can't wait until the next one comes out."}, {"userName": "Julia VERTIZ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70211983-julia-vertiz", "userReview": "Good read.

On to Book #3!"}], "description": "The magical world calls to me but I want nothing more than to heal. Working in the ER gives me a chance to help people while hiding from the magical world. It\u2019s a place where few magical folk ever visit, and never by choice. When a patient comes into the ER with a magical injury, I\u2019m forced to use my magic to heal, but doing so draws the wrong kind of attention to me. This time, I doubt Aron can help, especially since I know my type of magic isn\u2019t dark magic at all. It\u2019s worse. Much worse. Wanting nothing more than to hide from my powers, I\u2019m thrust into the center of a budding war between factions of mages. The Dark Council wants to use me, but I worry as much about the mage council discovering what I am. They\u2019ll do worse than burn off my magic. They\u2019ll be forced to kill me. With my work suffering, I have to find a way to end the magic attacks, or I might not only be forced into the magical world, I might lose my job. Postmortem is a fast-paced fantasy mystery with a mixture of medicine and magic that will leave you breathless.", "title": "Postmortem\n      \n          (Medicine and Magic #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40009586-postmortem", "average": 4.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1525127443l/40009586.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17920764.S_A_Magnusson", "name": "S.A.
