Not knowing what is going to happen to them, they are told to use the coins only if they have to, that they would know when the time was right. And most importantly, they must promise to try to always stay together.Two years later, the sisters are now in Barrack 25 in Auschwitz, along with many other Jewish girls. Every other day, the girls build a wall of heavy fieldstone, and then, they tear it down only to begin again. When a girl gets sick, she is taken to the hospital and never seen again. Everyone in the barrack knows what has happened to her and do their best not to get sick, despite insufficient clothing, food, and bedding in bad weather.When Rachel becomes ill, there is nothing Toby can do to prevent her from being taken to the hospital while she is working. Discovering Rachel gone when she returns, Toby knows she needs to do something quickly, or she will never see her sister again. Is this the right time to use the gold coins her parents gave them?Using her wits, some clever planning, some luck, and the gold coins, Toby manages to get Rachel out of the hospital and back to the barrack. But the next day at roll call, she pays dearly for what she has done when the guard sees Rachel on line but not in her roll book. The guard whips Toby on her back with the leash of her dog, but she didn't send Rachel back to the hospital. Both sisters survive the war and walk out of Auschwitz together.The Promise is a compelling and inspirational picture book for older readers about the importance of keeping promises, of family, and of the strength of sisterly love, particularly under the kinds of circumstances Toby and Rachel found themselves in trying to survive Auschwitz. And although it is a fictionalized biography, it is based on the real life experiences of sisters Toby, mother of author Margie Wolfe, and Rachel, mother of author Pnina Bat Zvi.The illustrations by Isabella Cardinal are done in a mixed-media of collage and photos together with textural drawings and finished in Photoshop, and really capture the emotions that sisters were feeling, and the anger and hate the guards had for them. The Holocaust was a very dark time in history and the illustrations aptly reflect that.Holocaust picture books are always a difficult subject for young readers - how much graphic description to include. If too much is included there's the risk that the young reader will be so traumatized by what they read, that they never want to read about the Holocaust again. And although Toby and Rachel, like everyone in a Nazi concentration camp, faced beatings, brutality, starvation, and death everyday, Wolfe and her cousin Bat Zvi have managed to find a balance between the mistreatment and the love and resilience that kept these two sisters fighting for their lives.The Promise is an important addition to the literature of the Holocaust, especially as it recedes into history. Keeping the Shoah alive by remembering it is so important now.This book is recommended for readers age 8+This book was an EARC received from NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2694983-laura", "userReview": "One of the traditions, in Judaism, is to retell the story. This is especially true of the Holocaust. The people who survived it are dying off, as it gets further and further away from the present generation. The stories we are hearing now, are those that are being told by their children and grandchildren. It is good that there is some witness, even though it is once or even twice removed.You might think we have had enough stories of the holocaust, be they novels or picture books, but each story is different, and each story should be told. This one, of two sisters, who survived the camps, was apparently written by first cousins, who had heard their mothers tell the story often enough that they could tell it as their own.The pictures, as seen here, are very bleak, but then, so is the story and subject itself.and here is the picture of the sisters all grown up.This is a very harsh, but very easy to read book on the holocaust, which would be good in school libraries, as well as public libraries.Thanks to Netgalley for making this book available for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Damaris Tonner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24060388-damaris-tonner", "userReview": "The Promise is a wonderful read, perfect for introducing young children to the reality of the Holocaust. Put beside beautiful illustrations, it would capture the attention of any young reader. There is always a fine balance between too much and not enough in children's fiction about delicate subjects such as the Holocaust, but The Promise is masterfully handled and toes that balance marvellously.

Forced into a the Auschwitz concentration camp the girls make a promise to stay together always. Then Rachel becomes sick and is taken away. Toby must decide on her own what she must do nextI'm going to start off by commenting on the illustrations because that's what's at the front of my mind. The illustrations are not going to appeal to everyone. They are described as being a mixed medium collage with texture and colours added. I don't hate the illustrations but I don't feel that this is the book where they are best suited. I liked the tonal quality, the darkness of the page, but...and it's a big but...I found the illustration style distracting and a bit jarring. The heads just didn't look right to me and it threw off the entire composition.What about the story though? I've had an interest in the events of WW2 for a long time - going all the way back to my teens - for me history is an important part of my life as it expands my knowledge and mind and helps me better understand\u00a0now because of\u00a0then.\u00a0The story itself is not an overly happy one (which considering the topic I would be surprised if it was) but is told in a manner that does engage. You feel sympathy for the girls and sort of have an underlying hope for them that they'll be okay at the end.Depending on your taste you may/may not find this one useful in the classroom.Thanks to Second Story Press and NetGalley for the free advance copy."}, {"userName": "Rachel McKitterick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20991798-rachel-mckitterick", "userReview": "*thank you to Netgalley and Second Story Press for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review*4 stars.This is the first children's picture book based on the Holocaust and Auschwitz that I've seen and read. To write and illustrate a book such as this for children needs to be done well and right. I believe that given the horrendous and emotional topic, there is a fine line between just how much to mention to such a young audience, but this story was very well told. It focused on the love between the two sisters Rachel and Toby while staying true to the events and cruelty of what it was like inside the camp without overly doing it. At first I will admit I wasn't a fan of the artwork, but by the end of the book, I can see now that it actually fits pretty perfectly with the story. You dont want the whole cute, beautiful and colourful illustrations you see in most childrens books because this story is not your typical childrens book. It is a story of a very dark time and the illustrations show that. Based on a true story, this is defiantly one book I would recommend. I really enjoyed seeing the pictures in the back of the real-life sisters and hearing that they remained so close throughout their lives."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "Based on a true story of sibling love and loyalty and the importance of a promise, this picture book even features photographs of the real-life sisters who somehow survived the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. All Rachel and Toby have of their parents is three gold coins secreted in a shoe paste tin and the admonition to use them only when they must. When Rachel becomes ill and is moved from the barracks where the girls are staying, Toby comes up with a plan to rescue her sister, and the coins finally come in handy just in the nick of time. Although Toby pays for her efforts with a savage beating, the Nazi guard does not make Rachel go back to the infirmary or further punish either sister. Readers won't be blamed for wondering if somehow this sisterly love softened the heart of the guard. I'd never heard this story or anything quite like it before, and was touched by it as well as being moved emotionally by the somber artwork, which contains collage cutouts of various characters set against a bleak backdrop. Even young readers might wonder what they'd do for their brother, sister or other family member and why such sacrifice and courage were needed."}, {"userName": "Michelle Kidwell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6011726-michelle-kidwell", "userReview": "The Promiseby Pnina Bat Zvi and Margie Wolfe, illustrated by Isabelle CardinalSecond Story PressChildren's NonfictionPub Date 18 Apr 2018I am reviewing a copy of The Promise through Second Story Press and Netgalley:The night Rachel and Toby's parents were taken away their parents gave them three gold coins with the instructions use them to help save lives.

It clearly benefits from being a true story, told with heartfelt compassion, and it's also commendable that all the characters are female, from the heroic sisters down to the guards. What I took issue with was the artwork - yes, I know it's an ugly place, and all the people in there were dehumanised, but did the collage effect have to make everyone so unpleasant-looking? Still, if your child can cope with a lot of words on just a few heavily-illustrated pages, then I'd go for this book."}, {"userName": "Denise Hershberger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8225652-denise-hershberger", "userReview": "This was an incredibly sad story told by family members of the sisters portrayed in the story. But it is a story that needs to be told and it was kept simple enough for an elementary child to learn about the Holocaust without being too traumatized. I loved the importance of the sisterhood in the book. I also loved the camaraderie among the women in the camp. The horrors they lived through were awful but it is nice to hear family stories told where the friendships lasted through the terrible times.I received an advanced copy of this book.

When the girls lose their parents to the Nazis, all they have left are 3 gold coins hidden inside a tin of shoe polish. They manage to hang onto the tin and stay together as they promised their parents, until one morning when Rachel is too sick to report to their assigned work detail. When Toby finds her sister gone from their barracks that evening, she risks everything and uses the gold coins to get her sister back.The haunting digital collage illustrations show Toby the night their parents are taken. Her curly shoulder-length hair is held back neatly by a ribbon and she wears a beautiful dress. That image is a stark contrast to the shaved heads and ragged dresses of the girls during their time in Auschwitz. The angry faces of the guards and the snarling teeth of the German Shepherds hint at the atmosphere inside the camp. But the kindness of other prisoners is also portrayed as girls share their meager soup or wrap their own blankets around Rachel as they try to help her get well.For those looking for an introduction to World War II and the Holocaust, this personal story provides a window into that time without including graphic descriptions or images. While the disappearance of sick and elderly prisoners is mentioned, there are no specifics given. And the text tells that Toby is whipped for rescuing Rachel, but the beating is not shown. The book has a happy ending, and there are even photos of the sisters from after the war and later in life.Recommended as a read-aloud for classes studying World War II, or as part of classroom and library collections for groups who have that time period in their social studies curriculum. I read an e-book provided by the publisher through NetGalley."}], "description": "The night that Rachel and Toby's parents are taken away by the Nazis, they give their daughters three gold coins. \"Use these wisely to help save your lives,\" they tell them.
