For as much as I hate to cook, I apparenty like stories about cooks - go figure. It sort of reminded me (very loosely) of the movie, Under the Tuscan Sun...(yes, I know it's a book and no, I never read it *gasp!*)Georgia is the type of character that starts off thinking she knows what she wants, but what she's got isn't it. Then, she loses her job and her fiance on the same day - and realizes she has a perfect opportunity to start over. Her dream job turns out not to be her dream job, but she makes a conscious decision to learn from it, making new friends and using the lessons she learns in Italy as the foundation to pursue her dream of opening her own restaurant. I like how she was honest with herself that she wanted to be in a relationship; she missed the sharing and intimacy (and sex) that goes along with all that being a couple entails. For whatever reason, while her girlfriends were sympathetic, I didn't really care for their characters - they felt materialistic and shallow.I did like the fact that Georgia's business partner was her friend and not a lover. It seems that frequently a female heroine has to rely on the romantic interest in all aspects of her life; that was not the case in Georgia's Kitchen. The way the partnership came around felt full circle to me - a relationship built on respect for each other's talents.The ending is not what I would call a typical HEA, more like an open-ended HEA if you will. Don't get me wrong, it was good and I as the reader was happy - I'd love to see Georgia again in a small cameo in a future book, you know, just to check in and see how she's doing."}, {"userName": "DeB MaRtEnS", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb-martens", "userReview": "I was looking for something very light, that I would hardly notice I was reading in between courses of more substantial books and demanding reviews.

Then her engagement gets broken off-all in the same day! She escapes to Italy, where she finds a new job as a chef, and a handsome new love interest, and maybe even finds herself.This was a nice piece of women's fiction, nothing too terrible happens, but nothing too exciting happens, either. I think cooking fans would be love this, as well as those in the restaurant business. However, I was expecting more out of the romantic storylines, but both of her love interests fizzled fast!!I like the message of empowerment the book gives to women and Georgia was very likable. She was strong but vulnerable at the same time. I really liked how she took a stand and didn't look the other way when she found out about the drug problem Glenn had been hiding from her.There were a lot of secondary characters in the book, but I never really connected with any of them besides Georgia. The bulk of the novel was about the restaurant industry itself, which wasn't really my cup of tea.This book was a little slow and didn't have enough romance for me. I'd recommend it to cooking enthusiasts and those in the restaurant industry. book was sent by publicist in exchange for an honest reviewreviewed for http://inthehammockblog.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/789415-michelle", "userReview": "If you're in the mood for an escape to Italy but your bank account doesn't quite agree, have a look at Georgia's Kitchen, a charming book that will transport you to a trattoria nestled in Tuscany's rolling hills. You'll also spend a good deal of time in bustling New York City, where Georgia lives full-time as a chef until her career takes a hit from a bad review and her romantic relationship crumbles. Off to Italy it is, then, for Georgia, where her passions become clear to her -- and to a local named Gianni.Georgia's Kitchen is a fun, delicious read that just may inspire you to dig deeper and follow dreams simmering below the surface. Nelson's writing is descriptive but tight -- and foodies will love reading about Georgia's exquisite creations, particularly as she strives to create the Tuscan trattoria's signature dish. This book would be great to take on vacation or even just to cuddle up with for a little while each evening, savoring each chapter.

Who would not be drawn to this? This is where it ended for me. I am not sure if my expectations for the book were too high or I had a notion in my mind how the book should read. For me I found the book to barely simmer as Georgia's story of moving to Italy and cooking was developed. The book did not have any spice for me. By the time it picked up in the last 75 pages it was too late for me to really enjoy the book."}, {"userName": "Raina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/215050-raina", "userReview": "I wanted to read Georgia's Kitchen initially merely for the Italian connection. I counted on this book allowing me to live out my passport-laced fantasies. Georgia's Kitchen did that and more.Georgia's the head chef at hot spot Marco, a restaurant that's booked up months in advance. She's not allowed much leeway with the menu, and her boss is slimy, but she's head chef and loving it. Georgia's engaged to entertainment lawyer Glenn, and life couldn't get much better. Until it gets worse. Marco receives a scathing review because her boss sleeps with, and promptly rejects, a food critic's only daughter. Someone has to take the blame, and Georgia's that \"someone\". The same day she's fired, her fiancee calls off their wedding, because he realizes that their relationship hasn't been working for some time. Georgia, jobless and fiancee-less, flees to Italy to work with her mentor Claudia Cavalli for a few months. Despite a few early disappointments in Italy, Georgia makes new friends and enjoys the change of scenery. When she receives an incredible job offer she needs to make a decision- does she take it and continue living far away from everyone and everything that she loves, or does she return home and finally start following her dreams. Jenny Nelson wrote a light and entertaining novel about a young woman looking for happiness and learning to stand on her own two feet \u2013 without a boyfriend, her best girlfriends, family, and the familiar surroundings of New York. What she finds out is that it\u2019s ok to ask for help when you need it. The people who mean the most usually want to be asked. Nelson\u2019s characters are believable but I wish some of them had been developed a bit more. For example, I wanted to know more about Georgia\u2019s girlfriends than what they wore. Bernard definitely has an interesting story but maybe it went through a huge edit. I was glad when he made an appearance again later in the book. Georgia was a character that I could root for, even if she did manage to make a few mistakes in her personal life along the way. I especially liked Georgia's parents in the book- they were well-meaning, yet intrusive. Her mother, especially, was initially unable to come to terms with Georgia's career choices, but the fact that she loved Georgia and only wanted the best for her was obvious. The book was a scrumptious treat from start to finish, between the descriptive and mouth watering foods described to the warm terracotta of Tuscany to the desire for Georgia to open her own restaurant. The Tuscany part of the book was my favorite. That and the food descriptions throughout. Nelson\u2019s writing had me craving good Italian food. My only complaints would be the five extra pounds I gained in reading (and eating my way through this book) as well as how a few things towards the end just fell so seamlessly into place. It just all seemed a little too easy at times. Thankfully, this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of this fun and ultimately inspiring read!"}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3363731-tiffany", "userReview": "Review is now on http://acozyreaderscorner.blogspot.comGeorgia\u2019s life seems to be right on track.

Her upcoming nuptials are only weeks away and soon she will have almost everything she has planned, aside from the children. Unfortunately for Georgia, plans change, life throws curve balls and people are finicky. All in one fateful day Georgia\u2019s life changes setting her on course to rebuild and rediscover herself. Georgia finds herself in the heart of Italy opening up a restaurant for a friend while learning and healing. What Georgia once found to me the most disastrous day of her life, ends up to be the best thing that could ever have happened to her. With determination and hard work, Georgia leaves Italy to make her dreams come true, finding happiness in the process.Georgia\u2019s Kitchen was a delightful read for me. I really enjoyed how the story starts and end in New York City while stopping off in romantic Italy for a spell. The chef topic and culinary aspects were wonderful and well researched. The author was authentic and seemed to know her way around the biz. I really enjoyed the characters in this novel. They were all well developed and understood. Each brought a little something different to the story and I can\u2019t imagine the novel without each of them. This novel encompassed a lot of topics and I felt each was explored adequately. Georgia\u2019s fateful day almost makes the reader happy for her, even though you know you\u2019d be devastated at the time. The character has obvious talent and charm that ensures the reader she will be okay no matter where she plants her feet.The writing style of this novel was my least favorite part. While most of it was easy to read, some parts were a little difficult for me to move though as they bored me with too much detail. These sections had detail that was not pertinent to the storyline. I understood them because of the culinary references but didn\u2019t really feel they were quite needed in the book. They seemed to take away from the book rather than add to it for me. Overall, I read this novel fairly quickly and enjoyed it! It is worth the time and effort to read, especially if you love culinary novels or a good chick lit. The novel is very up to date in its terms and internet media references. I enjoyed many aspects of this novel despite the very few counterparts.

Gosh!When Georgia's life comes crumbling down around her she picks up the pieces by changing location, lifestyle, leaving family and friends behind. She finds herself working with an old friend at an up-and-coming restaurant, with a staff that's helpful and encouraging, she makes new friends and even finds a love interest in a neighbor... but although Italy holds its appeal, her dream has always been to own a restaurant in New York.Ms. Nelson creates a wonderful protagonist in Georgia. She's tough but you can't help to feel bad for her with all the unlucky events she's going through. You like her from the start and will definitely be rooting for her. The supporting characters were just as fun and endearing. But my favorite were the descriptions of Tuscany itself. You will find yourself picturing the rustic backdrop, hearing the sounds and smelling its scent. Ms. Nelson definitely captures the tiny details and creates a very vivid setting. And then there were the descriptions of food - the details were so rich that I could actually envision and practically smell what was being cooked. Mouth watering.All in all, fans of chick-lit, romance and foodies will all find something in Georgia's Kitchen. It is light, entertaining and very charming.

Georgia is the head chef at Marco, \u201cthe\u201d swanky Manhattan restaurant, a job she is truly passionate about and she is about to marry Glenn, a successful attorney. Suddenly, in a series of rather bad luck events, her world begins to fall apart leading to the demise of Georgia\u2019s career at Marco and for me, the beginning of the novel. Nelson writes a charming, feel good novel, which is a quick read with precise details and fabulous characters. The reader can almost see, feel, hear and taste everything experienced in Tuscany, due to Nelson\u2019s rapt attention to details. Georgia is an immensely likeable main character the reader will be rooting for as well as enjoying Huggy\u2019s enthusiasm, being enchanted by Bernard\u2019s devotion and enamored with Ricky\u2019s sweet nature. My first impression of the novel was not a positive one with the superficial attitude of Marco himself, the snobbery and the illicit drug use. Had I not been reviewing this book I would have quit at that point, but I am glad I persevered. Georgia\u2019s Kitchen, while fairly predictable, is a delightfully charming feel good book.

Everything is going Georgia's way, she is a head chef, engaged to be married, and dreaming of owning her own restaurant one day. There is one small indicator that things might change. Chef's do not normally wear rings. It is just too dangerous, however Georgia's Glenn insisted that she wear her engagement ring. Funny thing that...Marco, the owner of the trendy restaurant has an eye for women and does not practice discretion. He decides to enjoy a young nineteen year old that is a daughter of a prominent culinary critic for the Daily News. The critic is justifiably angry, so, she takes it out on the review she is writing. Marco, in his blindness to himself, decides to fire Georgia, after all it must be her fault.Tarred by the review and unemployed Georgia escapes back to Tuscany.

Simply put, this book is delicious. However, kudos to the author for a well-written, well-rounded story.

I read this on the plane on the way to my vacation and wrapped it up the first day- it drew me in that much, and it's also not a \"heavy\" read. The author has a great sense of humor and the story is about Georgia's life, not just her brokem romance, but also about losing her prized job at a restaurant and how she began to really dig deep and start over.

Ze is chef-kok in een toprestaurant waar ze avond aan avond de sterren van de hemel kookt. Zo ook de dag dat de beroemdste recensent van de stad komt eten.

Als de recensie wordt gepubliceerd en Georgia niet 3, maar slechts een halve vork toebedeeld heeft gekregen, zijn haar culinaire dagen in New York geteld. Als dan ook nog haar verloving verbroken wordt, vlucht ze naar Toscane.", "title": "Georgia's kooklessen", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13503448-georgia-s-kooklessen", "average": 3.44, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330424767l/13503448.jpg", "reviews": 203, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/231370.Jenny_Nelson", "name": "Jenny Nelson"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4119629.Merel_Leene", "name": "Merel Leene"}], "type": ["Womens Fiction", "Fiction", "Food and Drink", "Romance", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13503448-georgia-s-kooklessen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10310729-georgia-s-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8078587-georgia-s-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8777733-georgia-s-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8724358-georgia-s-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/408342.Physics_of_Solar_Cells", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39210275-una-chef-con-estrella", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15504334-archibald-and-the-crunch-machine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8674509-jessica-and-the-lost-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7974289-raw-food-fast-food"]}
