I have read several authors in this genre but Richard Woodman seems rather unique. While his adventures are as entertaining as those of any of the best he does something no other has done. His hero, Nathaniel Drinkwater, is introduced to the reader as a young boy entering naval service as a midshipman. Over the course of Woodman's books this young man's character is developed and portrayed like no other hero of this genre. Woodman gives Drinkwater the virtues and vices of a real human being. Drinkwater does not win every contest and even when he does win he usually pays a price. Drinkwater is injured, he is scared, he is tormented, he is guilt ridden, he is depressed and worried. In this book Drinkwater is now plagued by age and its aches and pains. He is confronted by younger officers that think him over the hill. He is also facing the demons of doubt and guilt for past as well as present actions and their cost. I have now started to enjoy the portrayal of this character's depiction more than the adventures he engages in. I look forward to reading how Woodman handles Drinkwater's aging while engaged in a career in the 19th century British Navy."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31417718-jim", "userReview": "With this novel, Richard Woodman returns the Nathaniel Drinkwater series to the high quality that most of his books contain. Interestingly, this novel takes place just as Drinkwater is assigned to the Navy's Secret Department, a post held previously by his good friend, Lord Dungarth. Drinkwater is resigned to a lengthy stay in London, working behind a desk instead of standing on the quarterdeck of his own ship at sea. He then comes across news that an emissary from the King of Naples (General Murat) has arrived in Britain with a desire to see the Foreign Minister. Drinkwater follows up on this and learns that France is sending a shipment of arms and military supplies to the Americans to support the United States in its efforts to seize Canada away from Britain as part of its War of 1812 efforts. This news leads Drinkwater to take command of a small frigate and go in search of a means to thwart this transfer of arms.This is a book that has just about everything: battles between ships at sea, intrigue, espionage, treason and lots of excellent descriptions of life at sea on a tall ship at the beginning of the 19th Century."}, {"userName": "RhC", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39834583-rhc", "userReview": "This penultimate installment to the Drinkwater saga seems to find Nate in the throes of his last hurrah. Lots of action and various levels of intrigue; however, a rather anti-climatic conclusion. \u2026 Perhaps that is how life is meant to be for Drinkwater. Below the surface it's all so depressing for those of similar station in His Majesty's Service of that day. \u2026"}], "description": "1574091026|9781574091021.
