The pollution-choked air, the dusty lanes and angry matatu drivers, unhappy frenzy that sapped my body of its health each time I passed through. I've been down River Road, and I didn't like it. Meja Mwangi, you devil, how did you make me miss that city? This novel is gritty, and very male. The men cuss and fight and the women are all bitches. \nHe passes a few drunks on the way up the dimly lit dustcovered stairs. A drunk old man sits on the first landing and sends a river of beer vomit down the stairs. A half full bottle of beer stands faithfully by his side. He pauses between retches to talk to the beer bottle and swallow back whatever he has left in his mouth; one cannot afford to waste good food.\nAlcohol, that refuge from the constant struggle for survival. The poverty in this book is of a shape so jagged and heavy that it needs that balance of cold-blooded hell-raising. We have homeless people in Canada, but they are not so naked. We have brothels, but there are no crying babies in the corner. No one shits on the path.Going Down River Road is crusty like The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born but without the politics and moralizing. This isn't highfalutin literature. It's the lowest of the fucking low, and those bastards can plug their arses with God's grass if they don't like it. This pen is loaded with fire."}, {"userName": "Achieng Onguru", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16995427-achieng-onguru", "userReview": "Hahahaaaa Damn! I absolutely loved this one. You can almost smell the irritation of the writer as he penned this book. His irritation with the dump streets, unethical-beer-drinking-hip-shaking-man-hunting women of the late 70's and early 80's."}, {"userName": "Kairo Kimende", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19448192-kairo-kimende", "userReview": "After hearing so much about Meja Mwangi and how he changed the literary scene in Kenya I embarked on understanding his works hoping they would all be wrong. Well, I found nothing less than the promise. You thoroughly enjoy reading Going Down River Road. This is a book you would definitely reread. His way of writing even over a draggy scene blows your mind. Meja writes so real he captures events like scenes out of a movie. He paints very strong characters. You definitely want to meet Ben, Ocholla, Baby and Yussuf right from the first page. Makes other Kenyan writers look like boys with a pen. Whoever said it is right, no one else could paint Nairobi streets like he does. In this book he is a Grisham of sorts minus the suspense."}, {"userName": "Emily Kosnow", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106657-emily-kosnow", "userReview": "I found this book at a yard sale in a college town. I don't think I ended up being charged for it. I must say that this book was the best yard sale find of my life. Rarely does a book really take me far, far out of my element to the point that the world around me (outside of the book) feels strange. I was completely taken in to this Kenyan's gritty life. I finished this wanting more... I would love to get my hands on more books from this author.I forced my husband to read it and he felt the same way."}, {"userName": "David Mbiyu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2565949-david-mbiyu", "userReview": "I recall 'seeing' River Road in a different perspective after reading this book."}, {"userName": "Albertine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164532-albertine", "userReview": "very surreal to have read this while going down river road. a slice of life novel that makes place (in both a political and phenomenological sense) paramount."}, {"userName": "Karen Ashmore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17814226-karen-ashmore", "userReview": "I just could not get into this tale of a beer swilling cad who favors prostitutes.

Mwangi is not, not surprisingly, Kenya's most famous writer, but he has written Kenya's most influential book. Phew!This novel is an indictment of government failure (nay, absence), the extent of imported capitalist and the rot of humanity. Mwangi wrote with the skills of a reporter, satirizes the society without judging them. He is painfully non-partisan which makes his story powerful. The character of Ben is the father of modern African disillusioned character. Ben Okri, Festus Iyayi and Helon Habila heavily borrowed from the character of Ben. Ben is the perfect angry African that Ngugi in the Devil on the Cross, Soyinka in The Interpreters and Achebe in No Longer at Ease attempted but failed to paint.The novel is not just open to be read, it is a television in HD. The glory of the book is that the reader is a participant in the movie. I recommend this book to every lover of true, sincere, beautiful art."}, {"userName": "N.

Mwangi probably ranks as the most hard-boiled Kenyan writer of his time, though he does at times go over the top. I have personally lived in a few slums in Nairobi back in the 1980's, and despite the impoverishment and harsh living conditions, there were positive elements as well - decent people trying to do the best they could under the oppression of poverty. So, there is some sensationalism in the story, but still not far from the truth."}, {"userName": "Anne Kedi", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29488037-anne-kedi", "userReview": "It was a nice discovery.
