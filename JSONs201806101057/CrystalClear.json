Partner at one of New York's finest accounting firms, doting daughter of her aging father, and loyal girlfriend to her boyfriend, Steve, her life is completely under control. But when Crystal discovers that Steven has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, that her father has spent his gruff silent years yearning for a brother she never knew she had, and that--thanks to downsizing--her job may be in jeopardy, she is brought up really short.Suddenly, the 43-year-old nose-to-the-grindstone bean counter has to consider that maybe her best friend Rona--a New Age junkie--is right! Maybe her aura does need cleansing. Maybe her charkras do need balancing. Though never one to follow fads or trends, Crystal unexpectedly finds herself on the ultimate long-overdue vacation in mystic, metaphysical Sedona, Arizona. Set down amidst the swirling energy vortexes, among numerologists, astrologers, and experts in Feng Shui, Crystal checks into the post Tranquility resort, signs up for the highly-publicized five-day \"Sacred Earth Jeep Tour,\" and settles back, a total skeptic waiting--and almost willing--to be enlightened."}, {"userName": "Climbedhighestmountain", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9393235-climbedhighestmountain", "userReview": "This was a fun book. It takes place in Sedona, which is my favorite place in the world (for the red rocks, not the vortices). It has Jewish characters, which is so rare in a non-religious novel. If you're not Jewish, you probably don't notice these things. Let me explain: people in my family are never named Clay or Hunter or even John and our last names are not Finnegan or Smith. They are Goldstein & Schwartz (my 2 grandmothers), just like the protagonist & her grandmother.Back to the topic: The story is about a search for meaning without being profound or touchy-feely. It's about New Age mumbo-jumbo without either taking itself seriously or discounting the possibilities. More of a silly romp with an obvious conclusion.Back off-topic: Jane, you blew the ending. Here I sat, thrilled to be reading a book with Jews in it, and the very last chapter took place on Christmas Eve. Why? Many of us who are not particularly religious do not also embrace the wider culture that is The Christmas Season. It's entirely possible to ignore it. Except in books, because it's awfully hard to find one that doesn't mention Christmas at least once in passing. For this reason, you are not on my \"read it again\" list."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Holcomb", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3131886-stephanie-holcomb", "userReview": "If this book can get published, I can't imagine why publishers aren't knocking down my door. It wasn't uninteresting, but pretty poorly written and the characters/situation unbelievable.I don't think the author has the talent to write about characters to make them believable. Are there stuck up socialites interested in New Age stuff for their own gain? 10-year-old girls more interested in politics than Lady Gaga? Certainly. But the way she wrote everything came out like a Saturday Night Live sketch, kind of wooden caricatures of people, rather than people. I didn't believe or even care about lots of the people--especially the missing woman. If Jean, or Annie, had been kidnapped--yeah, it may have been different. The story was ok, the book was ok, blah blah blah."}, {"userName": "Luann Yetter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3634260-luann-yetter", "userReview": "The plot turned on the ridiculous premise that the main character just happens to find that the tour guide to her randomly booked tour is her long lost ex-husband from twenty years before.

After checking into the posh Tranquility resort, Crystal signs up for the five-day \"Sacred Earth Jeep Tour\" and settles back, awaiting enlightenment. What she gets is one hell of a surprise in the form of the tour's irresistibly handsome driver, Terry Hollenbeck--a.k.a. Mr. Totally Irresponsible Ex-Husband. And things go from complicated to downright crazy when Crystal's companion on the excursion, international jet-setter Amanda Wells Reid, goes missing in the desert. Now, searching for clues among Sedona's most eccentric characters, Terry and Crystal can't help but stumble into danger--and each other's arms--repeatedly. And Crystal can't help but wonder where her future really lies.", "title": "Crystal Clear", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/496075.Crystal_Clear", "average": 3.4, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1175227349l/496075.jpg", "reviews": 27, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8267.Jane_Heller", "name": "Jane Heller"}], "type": ["Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Fiction", "Romance", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/496075.Crystal_Clear", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1935335.Crystal_Clear", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2877760-crystal-clear", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12874520-chiara-e-trasparente", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202495.Female_Intelligence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545197.Best_Enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13254.Name_Dropping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13255.Some_Nerve", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139084.An_Ex_to_Grind"]}
