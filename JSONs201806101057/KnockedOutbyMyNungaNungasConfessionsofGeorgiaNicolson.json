Green (Georgia is a straight up bully and it's horrible how she talks about this poor girl), Jas (as a kid, when I thought Georgia was the most hilarious person on the planet, I remember thinking Jas was kind of annoying as well. now I realize she's actually a lovely caring friend and Georgia is just horrible to her), Miss Stamp (all this part time lesbian stuff is so awful) and her parents (again, when I was younger I remember thinking 'yeah! parents are annoying!' and now I'm like 'wait she has really quirky and kind of awesome parents').I have to keep reminding myself that she's 14 and will likely grow up into a better human being, but I have to wonder how the author herself feels about some of these subjects (ie. bullying and homophobia). I also recognize these were written awhile ago, but it makes me sad thinking back to reading these as a kid and knowing I didn't feel any sort of outrage at these parts when I was younger. Georgia is a terrible influence and I hate knowing she was a big role model to me, at least in journal-writing.I was losing steam on this series until Georgia started coming to her senses about Dave the Laugh and now I'm hooked again, even though part of me hates how problematic some of Georgia's sensibilities are. I never actually finished the series though, so I'm very curious to see if there's any growth."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "Another couple of hours with Georgia and, as expected, no life lessons but tons of hilariosity. Can't say much happens in this installment. The highlights are: Georgia's ever-growing nunga-nungas (a.k.a. basoomas a.k.a. breasts) which once again attract a wrong kind of attention, this time from a Scottish lad; a serious case of red-bottomosity (a.k.a. general horn a.k.a. sluttiness); and Angus's trouser snake removal operation.Some favorite bits:Saturday, November 6th1:00 pmI'd better start my makeup soon. It's only seven hours till the gig. But as I fully expect to be snogged to within an inch of my life, what about snogproof makeup?

Rosie says she puts on lippy AND lip gloss, then just goes for full-frontal snogging with Sven. She also says that by the end of the night he is usually covered in lippy, but he doesn't mind and wipes it off with his T-shirt.Good Lord.We must remember, however, that he is not English.The rest of the gang seemed pretty well to go along with the lip gloss absorbed into the general snogosity theory.So lip gloss it is.* * *9:30 pmJools has been looking at Rollo for about a million centuries and moaning and droning on about him. He was hanging out with a bunch of lads round the bar. I was trying to concentrate on looking at the Sex God. He is soooo cool. He's by far the coolest in the band. Dom, Chris and Ben are all quite groovy-looking but they don't have that certain je ne sais quoi that the Sex God has. That extra snogosity. That puckery gorgeosity combined with fabulosity. That sexgoderosity.Jools didn't seem to know I was in Snog Heaven because she was rambling on. \"He is quite fit, isn't he?\"\"Yeah, he's gorgeous and he's all mine, mine, miney.\"\"Gee, I mean Rollo, you banana.\"I was less than interested but she went on and on. \"Should I go across?\"Pause.\"Or is it too pushy?\"Pause.\"I think it's always best to play a bit hard to get, don't you? Yes, that's how I'll play it. He'll have to beg to get my attention.\"9:35 pmJools was sitting on Rollo's knee and snogging for England. Oh well.

I would have loved (and I mean LOVED) them in high school. They're written as the diary of a British girl named Georgia, and she covers all the drama, hilarity, embarassment, etc., of the high school years, only with a delightful Englishness. Really fun, reeeeeeally amusing. I don't imagine they'd meet with much approval from the parents of American teenagers, though- Georgia is pretty frank (even crude- she's a teenager after all) about matters of anatomy, and she's very cheeky and disrespectful of adults. I wasn't bothered, though- I think those kinds of things are what give it an honest ring. It was hard for me to believe that Georgia's voice was actually written by an adult. Here's an excerpt, the opening of the first book:\"Dad had Uncle Eddie round, so naturally they had to come and see what I was up to. If Uncle Eddie (who is bald as a coot) says to me one more time, 'Should Bald Heads be Buttered?' I may kill myself. He doesn't seem to realize that I no longer wear romper suits. I feel like yelling at him, 'I am fourteen year old, I wear a bra! OK, it's a bit on the loose side and does ride up round my neck if I run for the bus... but the womanly potential is there, you bald coot!'Talking of breasts, I'm worried that I may end up like the rest of the women in my family, with just the one bust, like a sort of shelf affair. Mum can balance things on hers when her hands are full- at parties, and so on, she can have a sandwich and a drink and save a snack for later by putting it on her shelf. It's very unattractive.\""}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44125660-beth", "userReview": "Sex God or A Laugh?

Already they're getting really tiresome. Georgia is 14 but acts like she's both 20 and 5 at the same time. Whinging on about her parents (who have absolutely NO consistency to their weak characterizations) being weirdos and her egg-headed uncle one minute, and then snogging the life out of guys who are quite a bit older than her, wearing short skirts, and going to clubs the next.I realized that so far there has been no real plot to the series: Georgia whines, her little sister comes in and is weirdly cute at random points (Georgia whines about this also), her mother flirts with any random guy, Georgia is mean to her \"best friend\" Jas who usually doesn't deserve it, and Georgia can't decide between (and whines about the pluses and minuses of) Robbie the Sex God who makes her legs go \"jelliod\" or Dave the Laugh who nibbles her lip during snogging and who she can coherently communicate with. Gee, I wonder who she'll FINALLY end up with?!It's so obvious and the \"plots\" are never interesting enough for me to care! Granted, I did get a few laughs out of the 3 I've read, but the laugh-to-boredom ratio wasn't worth it. If you're looking for a high school \"guys and drama\" series, read E.

I recalled seeing Louise Rennison's books back when I worked in a book store, and thought I'd track down the first in her series for my ereader. Well, that was not possible, since the publisher has decided to make only the third book (this one) and subsequent books available electronically. What's up with that? But none the less, I jumped in with this one even though I haven't read the first two.After finishing this book, I'm not sure I need to have read the first two to get what's going on here. This is exactly what I was looking for: silly, light-hearted, and fun. The book, like all the books in the series, I presume, follows either the journal or the internal monologue (not quite sure which) of English teen Georgia Nicholson. Rennison captures the spastic, creative, unfocused inner monologue of a teen girl with eerie accuracy. I mean, no one should be surprised by this, since presumably Rennison was once a teen girl herself. I love the fact that the author didn't try to polish up the inner life of a teen-age girl. She told it true. So excellent.Not as likeable was Georgia's selfishness. She's a funny character, but she's also a bit of a prick to her friend Jas. Jas seemed to be the only level-headed person in the entire ensemble of characters, yet Georgia frequently derided her and sometimes felt rather abusive in her approach to Jas. Too bad. It would have been easier to like Georgia if she would lay off her poor, sensible friend once in a while.Nor did I like the abruptness of the ending. Even considering that this is a series, the end of the book seemed to fall out of the sky and thud on the ground, with not even a few sentences to wrap it up and prepare us for what may come in the next installment. I also disliked the constant use of timestamps. That made it hard to tell whether I was experiencing the thoughts of Georgia or some kind of diary. I really had no idea, and the timestamps quickly became a tired gimmick that I just skipped over in favor of reading the text.All in all, it was a fun book and it did the job I needed it to do. I may pick up another, but if you're looking for anything other than simple, silly fun (good plot; deep, likeable characters) there are loads of other YA novels that will do that particular job much better. Bonus information: My sister's name is Georgia and my (real) name is Libbie (Libby). This is the first time I've encountered two sisters with our names in fiction.

She really does love her parents, even though most of the time they annoy her half to death and do things she finds appalling. You didn't feel like that as a teenager?! I did! She cares about her friends. She makes mistakes that she regrets. And what makes these books so fun is that they are almost like the diary of the class clown...how many books have you read like that?

I just realised that in the book Tom is younger than Robbie whereas in the movie they're twins. Also in the movie I love Georgia and Jas's friendship whereas in the books I feel so sorry for Jas 99.5% of the time.Another thing I can't wrap my head around is that I don't understand how Robbie and Georgia are dating when they barely spend time together???? PLUS Georgia always gets \"jelloid\" whenever she sees him and speaks absolute gibberish hahaha so I just don't quite get how this happened. How did Robbie get feelings for Gee when there hasn't been times and moments to develop some?! I've said this before, but in the movie those things are played out A LOT better. At least there the both of them spend time together and get the opportunity to develop some feelings. EITHER WAY, I do enjoy these books even though Georgia is a rude cunt and the vocabulary used is cringe as hell. Georgia can be ridiculously funny and that also quite makes up for it.

Once again Georgia Nicolson narrates her ordinary life in a highly amusing tone. This installment sees Georgia take a family trip to Scotland (\"och-aye land\"), juggle two boys and clumsily stumble through daily life. Georgia's voice is unique and entertaining. These books, while short and light, pack a lot into the small amount of pages and never fail to make me laugh out loud more than once which to me is the sign of a very successful book."}, {"userName": "Kathleen Dixon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/716890-kathleen-dixon", "userReview": "I should get the first two of this series. Not that they're necessary in order to understand - I mean, teenage girls are teenage girls - but they'll be fun to read (or listen to, as the case may be). Georgia is funny, single-minded (just think about what 15-year-olds can't stop thinking about), and self-absorbed. On top of that I found the narrator's voice just exactly right (and so it should be as it's the author herself reading it)!"}], "description": "Georgia Nicolson is now the girlfriend of the Sex God (aka Robbie), and things are wonderful.
