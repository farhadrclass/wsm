To make matters even more interesting, Nicole Montgomery, tomboy extraordinaire even today, intrigues each of them. She decides to run for mayor of little Cedar Grove. Peter also jumps into the race, and Jake offers to become her campaign manager.What none of this threesome count on is how Peter begins to fall for Nicole. But she doesn't dare trust her heart, not after having it stomped into the ground a a former cheating boyfriend. When Peter and Nicole both win enough votes to go into a runoff, the contest becomes more heated than either of them anticipate, especially when Nicole's eyes tell her what she never wanted to know about Peter. But is what she saw to be believed, and, if not, how can Peter tell her how he really feels?"}, {"userName": "Joanie Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12027480-joanie-bruce", "userReview": "This was a fun book to read. It starts off with a challenge that neither cousin, Peter nor Jake, can ignore. They both want different things, but have to compete with each other in order to obtain satisfaction of those goals.What I liked: The conflict in the story is real, and it builds up until the end of the book. I love the way the characters interact, and even though both men are competing for the same financial goal, they are still civil and honest in their dealings.What I didn\u2019t like: The premise that a grandfather would pit one cousin against the other in this way seemed a little unbelievable. It might happen, but a loving, caring grandfather, (as this one was supposed to be) would not have included such high stakes in a competition for two grandsons whom he loved.Over all I give this book five stars. The ending was a perfect solution to their dilemma, and it satisfies the desires of all the characters involved. I recommend this story to anyone loving a good romance with twists and turns involving conflict."}], "description": "She's his odds-on favorite\u00a0\n\nRunning for mayor of his Mississippi town wasn't even a twinkle in Peter Elliott's eye. But it could bring Cedar Grove's favorite son one step closer to his dream of building a youth center. He'd better watch out, though. Town councilwoman Nicole Montgomery has just thrown her hat into the ring.\u00a0The independent, smart-as-a-whip brunette is leagues away from the bookish girl Peter knew in high school. And he knows in his heart that Nicole would make a great mayor.
