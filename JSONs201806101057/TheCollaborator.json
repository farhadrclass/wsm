It is the memory of anguish which allowed them to do so. Kashmir has been a subject of savagery, a prisoner of fallacious hegemony and social chaos. The politics of Kashmir reflects a continuous decay and writings on the conflict in mainstream literature can help in gleaming out all those uncomfortable truths, to the world which hasn't been admonishing to our wretched conflictThe story of sad lives neighbouring delightful wilderness, the savage rituals of death, the Jihadi militia hostility, the ruthlessness of Indian Army and painful longings of childhood friends, is what The Collaborator tries to render on paper, and it does it with extraordinary skill.The Collaborator by Mirza Waheed, excels as an enchanting prose and is deeply disturbing. He uses a vocabulary of calibre, a comprehension so gripping that it challenges all those radical notions of bias amassed on Kashmir conflict.The principal character is a Collaborator in his late teens, who is a son of a village chieftain. He is a victim of calamities who buries decaying human remains, collects their used weaponry and ammunition in beautiful meadows, abutting springs and mountains. He steals their identities on the orders of his impelling boss - a merciless alcohol-loving and swearing army man in a local army cantonment - Captain Kadian.The Collaborator has sensed wild dogs growing fat on human flesh, he has seen headless bodies floating in streams, communities getting aroused towards fanaticism, and is longing for his childhood friends, who have embraced violence and crossed into training camps of Pakistan through secretive mountainous tracks, which are being discovered every now and then, by the Indian ground forces, and are endlessly shelled and bullet fired upon. There are even tales of betrayals and hatred aptly narrated. The book depicts adventures of this Collaborator in the quest for truth, lost love, amidst unceasing warfare, in an attempt to heal his consciousness, which is haunted by despair. The memories of his unforgettable childhood provide a catalyst to his motives. It is a story of Kashmir, seldom told before.The Collaborator is a bloke who has seen modest communities getting brutalises and cruel politics looming and choking Kashmiri lives. He has seen Kashmir submerging into a devastating conflict, bleeding in abundance. The book is set in an isolated mountain village of Nowgam in the 1990's, where reportage is barely possible, where war is ever active, where truth is most feared, and where the fright of death breathes with human lives. While reading through the narration, the book will answer all those unasked and haunting questions, which hold true for most Kashmiris. It is a fiction which excels as a deeply perceptive reportage of war and barbarity.The Collaborator succeeds. The novel entraps due to its engrossing storyline. The last page of the novel guarantees tears. Waheed fictionalises real events of the conflict in a cordial manner. His diligence in narrating his characters depicts sincerity and deserves applause. An elegance of ingenious imagination blending factual realities is the conclusion which can be drawn, after finishing the pages of this novel.Novels of this genre can significantly contribute towards a discourse on conflict resolutions. The narration is sometimes compassionate, sometimes a painful elegy, depicting wraths of barbarism, of frustrations, and sometimes showing inherent sensitivities of human nature."}, {"userName": "Khush", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76759105-khush", "userReview": "This is an excellent book on 'Kashmir'\u2013 a disputed zone between Indian and Pakistan. This beautiful region has a complicated history. In recent times, from 1989 onwards, this contentious history took even worser forms. There is this whole generation that grew up seeing Indian army as a colonizer victimizing the natives. Ironically, in this case, both the army and the Kashmiri people are the natives of the Nation-state we call India. Due to wrong policies of India Govt. military atrocities in Kashmir, deaths of young boys in custody, sudden disappearances of people further aggravated the conflict in Kashmir. Now the conflict seems to have reached a deadlock, there seems a no way out.The novel is a story of one young Kashmiri boy who collaborates with the Indian army, but deep inside he hates the Indian officer and his assistant. It is through this boy we know what is happening in the Kashmir valley, how army operates and to what extent army can go to maintain 'peace' and keep Kashmir 'integral to India.' The whole book bleeds but peace seems a distant country. The dream, desire and the rhetoric of peace is an excuse to shed rivers of blood.We further see how the friends of the boy-protagonist run away from their home villages to get military training in Pakistan. They all want to fight the Indian 'occupation.' And for good reasons, it seems. As one reads the chilling depictions of torture, humiliations, cold-blooded murders and so forth unleashed on innocent Kashmiris; one feels outraged and furious.Non-participating entities suffer the most in conflict zones. In the novel, we see how women, elderly people, children get trapped. Rape is used as a weapon against Kashmiri women. Ironically, both militants and soldiers wage wars in the name of protecting 'motherland' or the honor of their women; on the ground both rape women and damage the landscape. Militants rape to punish the Kashmiri families who seem to collaborate with the Indian forces; Indian soldiers rape women to teach militants a lesson.Landscape plays a very important role in the novel. One sees spectacular scenes of fields in the valley. Such an Edenic landscape has become a dumping ground of warfare's waste. The whole landscape now is now marked with check-posts, patrolling trucks and jeeps, bunkers. This has not only damaged the landscape; this has poisoned people and affected them in different ways. In the novel, we see how when boy and men fight, on whatever side, women are shown as nurtures. They maintain their kitchen gardens. They feed and nurse men and their children. In addition, women suffer in silence. Sometimes they suffer direct assaults on their person, but mostly they suffer in passive but very real ways\u2013 losing husbands and living as young widows, protecting daughters, having no access to medical help, restricting their movements, suffering violence within their homes, and so forth. This list can go on. The novel forcefully shows how nature and women suffer amidst warring masculinities.It is a bit depressive book. Just reading it makes one numb; how would it be for those who go through living it day after day. In parts, it seems like there is a lot of exaggeration in regard to the portrayal of Indian Army. But sometimes, maybe writers need to exaggerate, especially when a certain people are not heard, when they are ignored, when they are brutalized by those who claim to be their protectors and well-wishers.The more one reflects on war-zones, one knows that it can be stopped at once, but I suppose we love wars. There is a lot of money to make, weapons to buy and sell. It is a profitable business and everyone wants to have a share in the pie."}, {"userName": "Cat Townsend", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5419848-cat-townsend", "userReview": "The Collaborator is a chilling tale of life on the India - Pakistan border in 1990s Kashmir.Being immersed in this devastating conflict for only the few days I spent reading this book, I can't imagine how the author maintained any sense of normality during what must have been a lengthy research and writing period. Let alone how Kashmiris who lived through such horrid events ever managed to get back on with their lives.If I had thought about it while reading, I probably would have made a mental note that the book was well written and rather poetic. But the truth is that like most well-written books you don't think about the writing whilst reading it. I was however continually struck by how real the lead character felt to me. Here I am a 30 something female living in the UK and never having thought of this part of the world let alone travelled to it, and yet this boy feels and thinks and talks in a way that could be me feeling and thinking and talking. It is hardly a radical thought, but when we don't hide behind barriers of geography, economy, culture and language, then we really are all very similar. I have to be honest and say I didn't enjoy reading this book. But then I doubt enjoyment was the goal that the author had in mind. In many ways it was like watching a horror movie... you know that you don't want to see it, but you still can't bring yourself to look away or change the channel. The only problem is that unlike most horror movies this story feels way too close to the truth."}, {"userName": "Nazish", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5365750-nazish", "userReview": "It was the summer of 2008. We were tightly packed in an old beat up Mazda 929 as it hobbled up and down the jaunty road of Rawalakot (Azad Kashmir) leading to Hajira. I was visiting North with my family to kill the summer heat and there was no better place to be than at Rawalakot, a cool bustling city near the outskirts of Muzaffarabad. As we rode the rusty creaking car to the nearest village to the LoC, the rain overcame us and by the time we reached, a dread had already crept into each of our person. It was an exciting place to be - the beautiful streams toppling down from the giant mountains, the clouds brushing past along the wind, the green inevitability of the land, the terrace fields of colored flowers, everything about the place sang of the exquisiteness of the valley. But the threads of the natural beauty unhashed as soon as upon exchanging pleasantries with the locals and receiving warm welcome, we heard about a Pak-India encounter at the LoC. It couldn't be more timed. Just what I wanted to know about the situation at the LoC came to me in the concerned frowns and misty eyes of those people. Kashmir was beautiful during the day but dreadful at night. There was an ominous ring to everything that went about in Hajira valley. The fear, the trepidation, the anxiety of the place was haunting. Though everything was quite alright, I was never able to fathom that dread till today.After reading Mirza's novel, I came to understand that dread. The valley that hides many a secrets and stories in its limitless folds emanates that fear. Mirza's book encompasses one of such stories, out of millions of others that are probably muffled over by now but not quite dead. The grief of each story collectively screams out of the valley and anyone visiting the place cannot help but discern that feeling of anger and helplessness. The story is about a boy who is unnamed during the entirety of the novel, takes on a special duty to collect belongings off the corpses left to rot in a hidden gorge. Though the boy is disgruntled and takes on the job out of fear, he's constantly ridden by guilt and longs for the company of his friends who went missing - most probably crossed the border to Pakistan to get military training and pick up arms against the Indian army. While some of those men who cross borders to dream of upending the fate of the valley and turning revolutionaries encounter Indian Army, others left in the valley find it difficult to live under the constant surveillance of the same. There's hardly any climax in the story. It finishes off smoothly as it starts, showing the adeptness of Mirza's lyrical language which confers much without being overly dramatic. A must read from this part of the world."}, {"userName": "Sash Chiesa ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47311190-sash-chiesa", "userReview": "Kashmir is the eyes of a mother forced to helplessly witness her son being tortured and dragged away into the night, it's the footsteps of a schoolboy that could not find their way back home, it's the hours when innocence gets wasted playing Army vs. Militants, it's the heart of a girl whose lover has crossed over to Pakistan to become a militant, it's the ego that receives a blow each time the body is frisked, it's the youth that idolizes Hizbul Mujahideen, it's the father who is stripped off his dignity before his son, it's the sight that gets lost everyday to pellet guns, it's the exodus of kashmiri pandits, it's the people who just disappeared, it's the wives who are half-widows, it's the walls and windows that scream \"Azadi\" (freedom), it's the distant dream of a displaced Pandit to return to his beloved homeland, it's the disturbingly unforgettable memory of \"Kunan Poshpora\" and \"Gaw Kadal\".

Here. In Kashmir.In ways similar, or different, or worse.The prose is dark and intense. The unnamed protagonist, with his flawed character, now courageous, now cowardly and yet, always human... a soul who now has friends only in his memory is a chilling figure to behold.

After a particularly violent crackdown by the Indian Army, the young man is \"encouraged\" by the local army captain and his humiliated and defeated father to work as a special assistant to the captain, in opposition to the militants and his own desire to join them.The narrator then travels back to his idyllic and carefree childhood with his friends and family, before the appointment of the virulently anti-Muslim head of Kashmir and the electoral fraud that served as triggers to the uprisings that led to the bloody conflict throughout the region. The villagers suffer great hardship, as the Indian Army brutally punishes the families whose sons have joined the separatist movement, aided by local collaborators (not including the narrator). As the conflict becomes more intense and more villagers are tortured or killed, each family and each person must decide to stay in the village, or flee to an unknown destination, and an uncertain destiny. The narrator is also torn between loyalty to his father, who begs with his son to stay in the village and work for the Indian Army captain who regularly insults and tortures his people, and his desire for revenge and justice for his friends and neighbors.The Collaborator is a superb and gripping debut novel, which is also an insightful and instructive book about the recent crisis in Kashmir, which I found difficult to put down after the first 20 pages."}, {"userName": "Arvind", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-arvind", "userReview": "3.5/5. Good but way short of the class of Khaled Hosseini. The start of terrorism (early 90s) in Kashmir is told from the POV of a 17 year old boy living in a border village. Having read Rahul Pandita, Basharat Peer, Kamleshwar etc on Kashmir, A few questions that came up in my mind :-A) The valley was largely peaceful till the end of 1980s. Did Talibani fundamentalism get imported into Kashmir from Afghanistan via Zia-ul-Haq's radical Pakistan ? Why did 'freedom fighters' kill civilians mostly from minority community ?B) The brutal forced exodus of all 3.5 lac Hindu Kashmiri Pandits forced out from their homeland in the same timeframe by other Kasmiris is mentioned just passively in the book in a couple of sentences. Even Governor Jagmohan's past is dealt with a lot more detail. Hopefully, it is a feeling of shame that led to this topic being avoided in the book.C) There is burning contempt for the Indian army because of human rights violations and that they 'catch-and-kill' 'youngsters'. How else is an army supposed to deal with insurgents if not 'catch-and-kill'. Infact the Indian army as per the author himself became involved once this movement picked up and not the other way round.D) Kashmir acceded to India in 1947 to save itself from the brutal invasion from Pak. After 40 years, how can India allow 2-nation theory be repeated ? And do Kashmiris realise where does it place their co-religionists in India living peacefully. And Kashmiri legislature as of this date rejects 'secularism'.E) In the book 'ghairat' (self-respect) was mentioned with anger. I hope someday processions will be carried out refusing the Central govt aid money which forms 88% of d state budget. And allow investments to come in state for lasting prosperity."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3652044-ian", "userReview": "This was a real disappointment. I was hoping for a balanced novel about the separatist struggle for Kashmir, that could provide an explanation of the history of the continuing conflict between India and Pakistan. However although it shed some light and was often heart-rending and brutal in detail in relation to the oppression of Kashmiri Muslims by India, it's portrayal of the central teenage character too often read as a simplistic YA novel that was naive and just far too one sided politically. Effectively India all bad with no shade of grey in amongst the darkness. Even if the central political points remained the same, that India has always been in the wrong since partition and that its troops have committed gross war crimes which have never been brought to account, the novel would have been much more effective if it had had at least one Indian character that was not a caricature-esque complete and utter bastard."}, {"userName": "Kathy Hiester", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4442776-kathy-hiester", "userReview": "In The Collaborator by Mirza Waheed the unnamed narrator flashbacks to his tranquil and lighthearted childhood with his friends and family, before the selection of the anti-Muslim leader of Kashmir and the electoral deception that served as a trigger to the rebellion that led to conflict throughout the region.

For more reviews, go \nhere\n.Like most books I have been reading since the past few months, The Collaborator had been sitting on my shelf for years. When I picked it from my TBR jar, I was more than happy to finally get to it. I don't remember reading reviews of the book as the sole reason I bought it was because it is set in Kashmir and as a topic that interests me, I feel disappointed to say that I haven't read many such books.When I finally started reading The Collaborator, I was slightly let down by its slow pace. While author Mirza Waheed's writing is beautiful and he portrays melancholy in a way that's admirable and inspiring, I felt the story itself lacked not only pace, but interest as well, somewhere. It seemed to me like it was not moving.Don't get me wrong, I love all the knowledge I gained from this book, because- and again, this is something I am ashamed of- I never really followed what happened in Kashmir. My sole explanation for this is the fact that I was too young, which isn't always a good excuse. Anyway, so while I did learn a lot; some things which I will never forget, some pictures that'll never erase from my mind, I felt like things were moving too slowly because I never though I'd take almost a month to finish this book.The Collaborator is told from the point of view of young seventeen year old boy whose name we never get to know, which for me, is true art. Employed by Captian Kadian to look after the dead bodies literally tossed across the border, left behind by all his friends who go away to become militants, this young boy is a hero. I found him to be so relatable, because when I put myself in his place, I would've probably done what he did.Overall, The Collaborator is a poignant read that gives a brilliant insight into life in Kashmir, and author Mirza Waheed's melancholic writing is beautifully depressing."}, {"userName": "Hariharan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10875691-hariharan", "userReview": "A haunting novel, ofcourse in the genre of kite runner. But unlike kiterunner, which aims in a happy setting followed by sad setting to reveal the stark difference, the present book starts with a melancholy thread and weaves the story from a sad depressed narrator, whose recollection of happy times also brings sadness. I didnt cry, but the last chapter when the last rites were performed, i did smell kerosene. This book aptly describes the sentiments of a typical kashmiri and the sentiment includes harshness towards indian army and sympathy towards pakistan. One often mistakes that kashmiris are sympathizers with pakistan. No, its just that the azaad pakistan is filled with their own clan who have crossed borders and they sympathize with all the hussains and Guls and Mohammeds they had known. If some Kashmiri Pandit can write a similar novel with the experience of yester years, i guess one may not sympathize with the jihadis as much one may sympathize when reading the novel."}, {"userName": "MNLO", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8648816-mnlo", "userReview": "Maybe it was the wrong time for me: http://bit.ly/2sa2yRq"}, {"userName": "Bookmuseuk", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28431765-bookmuseuk", "userReview": "A dark, passionately angry account of the human cost of the war for Kashmir. The unfolding horrors are seen through the eyes of a young boy growing up in a lush valley near Kashmir\u2019s Line of Control between India and Pakistan, among corpses, army crackdowns, gunfire and fear.Mirza Waheed is a Kashmiri now living and working in London. His first novel, The Collaborator, is written with a barely veiled rage and hatred toward the Indian army and its political masters who set military policy in Kashmir. The unnamed boy who tells his story was, in happier days, one of a small group of lads who learnt to swim in Kashmir\u2019s crystal mountain streams, and played cricket on their banks, who wandered in the forests with their dog, and were well known in their small settlement, a village built from scratch by a tribal group of people who once roamed the mountains with their flocks. Their families build homes, shops, including an essential tobacco shop, and a mosque, before war forces the whole village, except for the narrator and his family, to flee for safety.The boy\u2019s friends leave first, in secret. This an abandonment and betrayal from which he never fully recovers. Much of the story is driven by the narrator\u2019s search for his childhood companions and to find out what happened to them \u2013 something that is ultimately revealed to him only in hallucinatory dreams. He discovers that they took the dangerous route across the border, helped by a local \u2018guide\u2019, to become trainee jihadis in Pakistani-Kashmiri groups who raid the borderlands. The trauma of this loss, and his horror at the possibility that he will find their mutilated bodies somewhere in the valley where the Indian soldiers fling rebels they have killed, infects the whole story. The narrative twists and turns in repetitive, barely differing scenes between his imagination and reality, his memories and present events, in an obsessive circling that brings the reader back again and again to confront his grief, his rage, his horror in a way that mimics the process of trauma itself. For him it is made all the worse by the fact that he is forced to work for the Indian army, stripping rebel corpses of valuables, ID and weapons amid the stench of death, terrified each day that the bodies he turns over will be those of his friends. Sometimes he imagines that the corpses of his compatriots speak to him.This was quite an intense, harrowing read, with wonderful portraits of local characters in the village, and yet for me there was one part I wished had been more explicitly outlined and justified. There is no disguising this novel\u2019s partisanship, but the sources of the conflict in Kashmir are never discussed or explained, nor why the youths feel they have to turn against India in the first place. There is just a gut loathing. I would have liked something more nuanced, and the \u201cbad guys \u201c\u2013 the Indian politicians and army staff, particularly Captain Kadian, the commanding officer \u2013 to be less utterly bad and more complex and sympathetic. The viscerally felt cultural division between Muslim and Hindu is also never really explored \u2013 it just exists on the page without any justifying initial incidents or counterweight. A narrative of this type where the bad guys were all of some other single racial group would ring alarm bells that would necessitate a much subtler approach and the raising of all kinds of questions over prejudice and racism. What the narrator witnesses is horrific. His own emotional experience justifies his personal hatred. But the opposite perspective or the ideological foundations of the conflict are never adequately presented. Nevertheless, as a first-hand portrayal of the civilian experience of war, it\u2019s gut-wrenchingly matchless."}, {"userName": "Mark Staniforth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4106933-mark-staniforth", "userReview": "Mirza Waheed's 'The Collaborator' shines a light on the often forgotten Kashmiri conflict through the eyes of a teenage boy who grows up in the remote village of Nowgam on the disputed Line of Control.Waheed tells a harrowing story of long-standing, senseless violence in a beautiful land of precipitous valleys and high peaks, \"some shining, some white, some brown, like layers of piled up fabrics\".Born and brought up in Srinagar, Kashmir, the author handles such a sensitive subject well, framing the crushing brutality within a very human tale of betrayal as the narrator's three close friends disappear over the border to join the militant struggle:\"Two years ago, Hussain was the first to disappear from the village. The musically possessed, the gentlest and the noblest of the group, was the first to fall. We had met as usual in the street on a Sunday evening, and had bantered away into the night. But the next evening, he was gone. Vanished. That evening he had looked calm, relaxed, as usual, moving from one foot to the other as he always did, while he listened to Gul Khan's retelling of his latest infatuation. Gul had taken a liking to Nuzhat, Commander Chechi's dimwit daughter, or more accurately, her swelling chest, and was trying hard to make his anecdote funny to give us the impression that he wasn't too serious about the girl. Like the rest of us that sweet October evening, Hussain listened, and laughed, but the next evening he was gone.\"Stranded in his village, the narrator is forced to collaborate with the Indian forces and is given the thankless job of heading into the valley to count the corpses and loot their personal effects, fearing each day that he will discover the bodies of his friends among them.'The Collaborator', longlisted for the Guardian First Book award, is a brave first novel. If it occasionally falters - the boy's tormentor, Captain Kadian, is a drunk, bloodthirsty tyrant whose total lack of redeeming features makes his frequent, profanity-spilled rants a struggle - Waheed's plot remains admirably free from clich\u00e9.Since Aravind Adiga won the Booker Prize for 'White Tiger', it has become almost fashionable to embrace bright new fiction from the sub-continent. Yet many have failed: strip away their vividity, and they have precious little left to say. The same accusation cannot be levelled at Waheed.

Its the culture, the people, the conventional wisdom that emanates from some characters and the utter familiarity with the atrocities taking place. As for the atrocities, disclaimer here, to be fair, no I haven't seen my son dragged out of the house only to find him months later, almost disabled and abused beyond recognition...the naive and crude manner in which I do relate is that you just are familiar, as a journalist, a Pakistani, of the horror tales that do in a very real perspective take place around you. Yes, there is a certain degree of desensitization that constant news reports on torture provide, but this book breaks through all of that.For a first novel, Mirza Waheed has done wonders with his craft of story telling. You can almost feel the pain, as if you've lost your own young one. The terror, the ambiguity, the lost hope. and the understanding that dawns on why people voluntarily step into a hell from where they can never return alive, in the name of patriotism, is something that doesn't leave you that soon.If you think Nadeem Aslam's genius has only captured that sinking yet profoundly beautiful feeling of a character's immense pain, you're in for a surprise. This is surely worth a read."}, {"userName": "Poonam", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/357223-poonam", "userReview": "I couldn't recommend this book to anyone to read. This book is a shadow of what it could have been. 50 pages down the book, it doesn't seem like that writer is interested in telling a story. The narrator, a nameless boy, son of sarpanch of a Kashmiri village in Nowgown, has been employed by Captain Kadian of Indian army, presumably against his will, to scour the dead bodies of infiltrators and collect their weapons and ID cards. Narrator's family is the only one living in their village since everyone else has left once army took over after 4 boys from the village crossed the border to train as militants. That's it - that is the plot.Soon the book becomes whiny and agenda-driven. Captain Kadian's character has been created solely to put a face to alleged barbarism and human rights crimes committed by Indian army. Waheed was a Kashmiri journalist and I've followed him on Twitter and read his views, it was as if was regurgitating his rage and hatred at Indian army, government and the much hated Governor of Kashmir, Jagmohan. I wish Waheed had tried to show and not tell via his story, I was much willing to read it.My copy of this book is available for a free giveaway to anyone who would have it. I finished reading this book by sheer grit; there wasn't any pleasure in it."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12781210-susan", "userReview": "Although I have put this on the India \"shelf\" it really belongs on a Kashmir shelf. (I read in a review that this is the first novel written from the Kashmiri point of view but hope that is not accurate.) This is a beautifully written book, and one of the saddest and most heart-breaking I've ever read. We follow the young adult narrator, a young man living in a Muslim village near the LOC (Line of Control) which is at the border of the - undeclared - war between India and Pakistan. His closest friends leave for Pakistan to fight against India. We - and he- never know if they survive the crossing or the fighting. His is the only family that stays in the village; his father is the \"headman\" and everyone else leaves, worn out and terrified by the violence inflicted on them by the Indian army. Our narrator, whose name we never learn, begins to work with/for the Indian Army out of fear and terror. The descriptions of the family relationships. friendships, the beauty of the mountains and the scenery - all so wonderfully written as is the insanity of the violence."}, {"userName": "Varun Kashyap", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19906519-varun-kashyap", "userReview": "Mirza Waheed's depiction of Kashmir is beautiful. The anguish felt by Kashmiris , their struggle for freedom hijacked for insurgency and made into militancy , its all there and moves you. I loved and related to everything about Kashmir, felt the pain of the locals and could empathize with their cause . So far so good .. However, the plot is weak. Its more so towards India hatred - its fair or not thats different. I can understand the incursion of Indian army in a sleepy village might not bring out too much affection from the locals, but here it has become quite redundant so much that it takes away the essence of few subplots. The despair and pain felt for being left lonely is touching at first but moves towards whining by the middle. I felt the ace sluggish and stagnant in the middle and towards the end. It felt to me once the story moves from the essence of Kashmir to the plot the author is not sure how to take the plot forward. Read it for Kashmir, for what it was and how it was spoilt for vested interests . Good one but not what i had expected."}, {"userName": "Frank Callaghan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7554601-frank-callaghan", "userReview": "This book made me dream each night. I found it harrowing in it's detail, and I assume in its accuracy of terrorism and war. It was however compelling, and the two main characters are intertwined in a most absorbing way. Totally different in their roles and background, their weird interdependence became fascinating. I loved all the parts about village life and family, and I especially liked the descriptions of the friends, who whilst being central characters to the tale, are never really in it after the first pages. The writing is sensitive, and at the same time, often graphic, displaying the horrors of war explicitly. It also gets under the emotions of terrorists and those that oppose them, and shows humanity for what it sadly can be. This was a book I was pleased to finish because of the way it disturbed me, but at the same time I had to keep reading it. Not for the squeamish, but a book that for me, demands reading if only to get a perspective on yet another pointless war zone."}, {"userName": "Happy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4312859-happy", "userReview": "The situation in Kashmir is close to my heart having travelled there a few times and developed friendships with Kashmiris along the way.I have read a few fiction and non fiction books on the conflict, this book is written from a different angle to previous books I have read. The main character, a 19 year old man narrates his story over a two year period telling the story of how he became a collaborator, how his friends deserted him to travel across the border into Pakistan to become militants, how his family became the only family left in the village. What a sad and lonely existence.I would recommend this book for those interested in Kashmir and the situation that is ongoing there."}, {"userName": "Jon Browning", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40949490-jon-browning", "userReview": "This book is a strange case of good story/ bad writing. It takes whole pages of description to say what could be said in a few sentences. The beginning is especially bad at this. Once the story picks up (around Part II) it gets better, but I just had a very hard time staying focused on the book as paragraph after paragraph bored me with overlong descriptions and dialogue that said almost nothing (and oftentimes the same nothing over and over). Overall I think the story was very good but the book itself suffers from a writer trying too hard to impress with his writerly skills."}, {"userName": "Roz Dibley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3060901-roz-dibley", "userReview": "Got this book out of the library as it was on Guardian First Book Awards List - difficult subject area but a book that has made me much more aware of the situation. It does one of those things that great novels do, inform and educate while you read more on a subject so that you come out the other end knowing more and enjoying the experience. I would recommend to anyone. Moreover, while listening to a BBC documentary http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00lskff, I had a much better understanding of what the journalist was talking about."}], "description": "It is Kashmir in the early 1990s and war has finally reached the isolated village of Nowgam close to the Pakistan border. Indian soldiers appear as if from nowhere to hunt for militants on the run. Four teenage boys, who used to spend their afternoons playing cricket, or singing Bollywood ballads down by the river, have disappeared one by one, to cross into Pakistan and join the movement against the Indian army. Only one of their friends, the son of the headman, is left behind. The families in the village begin to think it's time to flee, to search for a place of greater safety. But the headman will not allow his family to leave. And, whilst the headman watches his dreams give way beneath the growing violence, his son, under the brutal, drunken gaze of the Indian army captain, is seemingly forced to collaborate and go into the valley to count the corpses, fearing, each day, that he will discover one of his friends lying amongst the dead. \"The Colloborator\" is a stunningly humane work of storytelling with a poignant and unpredictable hero at its heart. In one of the most shocking and brilliantly compelling novels of recent times Mirza Waheed lights our way into the heart of a war that is all too real.", "title": "The Collaborator", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9555685-the-collaborator", "average": 3.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1287771575l/9555685.jpg", "reviews": 53, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4419372.Mirza_Waheed", "name": "Mirza Waheed"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Cultural", "Politics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9555685-the-collaborator", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14799915-the-collaborator", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10246606-the-collaborator", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23035984-the-book-of-gold-leaves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18480304-the-nightwatchman"]}
