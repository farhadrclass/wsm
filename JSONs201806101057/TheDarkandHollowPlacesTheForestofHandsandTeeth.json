I'm still laughing.To have enough lift for 3 people and a supply of firewood, the airbag would need to hold approximately 2,500 cubic meters of hot air. It seems improbably that Annah would have found enough nylon or silk to construct even a single balloon. Cotton, polyester, or wool wouldn't work, the fabric is too stretchy and heavy. The inconsistency of a wood fire, coupled with the danger of sparks igniting the oiled cloth, probably wouldn't have been a success either. There were no test flights, no modification to the design. Nothing. It's hard to believe that dozens of these balloons were constructed in secret, or that any of them were air-worthy.

Well, Carrie Ryan spares no sort of mercy for her characters. In fact, she leaves your soul begging for a way out for them. I found myself bargaining with Ryan to please cut them some slack! But Alas, such is not the way in any of the Forest of Hands and Teeth novels. While the POV changed from each of the three books, one constant always remained:\nOr the \u201cUnconsecrated,\u201d \u201cMudo,\u201d or \u201cPlague Rats\u201d depending which book you\u2019re on. The Dark and Hollow Places (or the series in general) is epic. I can honestly say I really, really liked it, perhaps even loved it. However, it is not an adventure I would want to read again. It is just too damn depressing. And I\u2019ll probably have Zombie filled dreams the next night I sleep. The world Ryan creates is so grim, so full of darkness and despair. Honestly, its awesome. It feels like you are watching a horror movie. The book picks up with Gabry\u2019s twin sister, Annah. What a broken character! At first, I thought Annah was sure to annoy the hell out of me with her constant complaints of her scars. But she quickly grew on me. Annah is a very strong, solid, female protagonist. Is she flawed? Sure. She is so used to depending on herself for everything, that she is afraid to let anyone get close to her. Throughout the novel, she learns that if she or her loved ones are going to make it, she has to learn to trust again. Annah can not take a break in this novel. Ryan puts her through some pretty hellish situations that left me doing something like this: \n Or this: \n I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book. Nowhere was safe, not from the Zombies or the recruiters. Many times they all just wanted to give up. But really, who could blame them? Ryan brought up a very good question in this book: What is the difference from surviving and simply existing? What do you do when you only have a short time to live? Well, you LIVE. You continuing fighting, feeling, believing. So, if you haven\u2019t read this book or series\u2026what are you waiting for?! The Return?!

The thing is, that book blew me away. I loved the mystery, the surreal quality, Mary's craziness, the pervading sense of doom and of course the never ending onslaught of the Unconsecrated. I remember reading the book late at night, in the middle of a storm while the hubby was away. Between the wind and lightening I could hear moans of the undead, and when thunder shook my old, isolated house I imagined hoards at my door. I was so spooked that I actually had to put the book down and take a break from it! Carrie Ryan can write a creepy zombie story that is for sure. Needless to say, I was completely let down by the teen angst portrayed in The Dead-Tossed Waves, almost so much so that I considered not continuing with the final installment of this trilogy. But of course I did finally read The Dark and Hollow Places. The verdict? Well, Carrie Ryan can still write some of the best zombie scenes ever. So many zombie books fail because they go for the immediate scare and shock value. But Ryan manages to build up a slow tension and throughout the novel and allow the reader to truly see the hopelessness and horror of a zombie apocalypse.And then they come, stumbling from the cloud of dust and dirt: Unconsecrated. At fist it\u2019s just a few, but then there are more and more, struggling across the rubble and flooding into the streets. Slow but steady they flow like blood from a seeping wound. Some are short and some are tall. Some men and others women. Some wear clothes from olden times and some are naked, their bodies striped with wounds. But all moan with gaping black mouths. All claw at the air, reaching and needing. Some of them shuffle on broken limbs, arms gnawed away, with stringy gray tendons swinging with each step. There are more than I could ever count and I know this is just the beginning. Soon the entire City will fall to them. I stare and wonder how we\u2019ve survived as long as we have against such an inevitable destruction.Unfortunately, Ryan also has a desire to write about teenage angst and lurve. While this worked well in The Forest of Hands and Teeth, it\u2019s old hat by now. At this point the zombie scenes and the supporting characters are meant only to hinder the romance and heighten the angst. Teenagers talk philosophically about the nature of life, love and death and manage to be the only good guys amongst many of the survivors we encounter. *yawn* The Dark and Hollow Places is a solid three stars for me. While I absolutely love Ryan\u2019s ideas and writing style, her execution of this trilogy leaves something to be desired. I would love to see her break away from a plot which is so dependent on the lurve and the angst."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "I really liked The Forest of Hands and Teeth, which I thought was a bleak, well-written take on the whole zombie story. I wasn't as big a fan of the follow-up novel, The Dead-Tossed Waves, primarily because I thought Gabry was a bit of a whiner and a little too obsessed with boys in the middle of all the death, dying, and undead. As such, I wasn't sure whether I was eager to follow the story with the third installment in the series, but happily The Dark and Hollow Places returns with a compellingly flawed narrator in Annah, Gabry's long-lost twin. A frightened and lonely child who grows up to be a scarred and mistrustful woman, Annah is much more interesting than her sheltered twin--and Catcher, who was part of the triangle in the last book, is much more appealing than Elias. As with the previous books there's a lot of running away from the Unconsecrated, hiding out in forests, and fighting off unwanted attention.I would preferred to have seen Annah come to accept herself in a more obvious way, to have had a little more time spent on her relationship with Catcher (it felt a little too close for comfort to have her pining for both of her sister's lovers), and I still don't really understand why authors ever want to write in the present tense. But overall the story moves along at a fast clip with descriptive narration and some pretty cool action sequences. There's a fairly open-ended close to the novel, but being that there are finally some notes of hope in this dark world, I'm kind of hoping that this is the end of the series. Better to let it finish on a high note than to let it drag out interminably."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "This is definitely the best of the three. Just as original and thought provoking as the first two in the series- in The Dark and Hollow Places we follow yet a new character, Annah, as the protagonist. Although the others from The Dead-Tossed Waves are present as well. Some more than others, but don't fret- you won't miss anyone; Annah's story is plenty interesting. I also found her to be a much more competent main character than Mary and Gabry. She is strong and self sufficient. I really admired her determination and will to live.In addition to its originality, we still run and hide, escaping the Unconsecrated, fighting for our lives in this exhilarating pulse pounding conclusion. Although the ending is still a bit open-ended with room for more books in the future, I'd be fine if this was it. It's a perfect way to end this series: Hopeful and believable.There is no slow start in this third novel. We are thrown right in at high speeds that don't slow down until the last page. It's easily the darkest book in the series. The Unconsecrated are not the only enemy anymore, and I don't know which is worse. We really see the lengths that people will go to in order to survive. Some even make the zombies seem charming. Regardless of all this horror, we've still got some love and romance to gush through. The chemistry between the characters is much more present which makes it easier to root for them.It's all brilliantly written. The settings, the different protagonists, the passion, the helplessness, the hope, it adds up to give a very realistic world. It made my adrenaline pump and my heart ache. I thoroughly enjoyed it all. I also have to mention that the covers are gorgeous!!

I would've enjoyed this one so much more right after the other two because this really brought all the storylines together nicely! It finally all made sense now! Book 1 was about Mary. Book 2 about Mary's daughter Gabry and this one was about Gabry's twin sister Annah and included pretty much all the characters from the previous books, still trying to survive in a world full of Unconsecrated.I really don't get why these books aren't more popular! These already draw you in by their haunting titles! And don't get me wrong, these are definitely not everyone's cup of tea. They're extremely dark and made me question humanity more than once. I felt hopeless in Annah's place because of all she had to go through, but she was headstrong and never gave up! I admire that about her and I wish I was more like her in that aspect. I probably would've been dead literally 0.5 seconds after the zombie outbreak started lol, I'm just that clumsy. She also literally managed to find love in a hopeless place.

Partly, I blame the stupidity of ongoing health dramas. Partly I blame myself. This is \"the final\" book in the trilogy... and I simply did not want to let these books go.The Dark and Hollow Places starts out with a new character - Annah, the twin sister of Gabry from book two. Annah lives in the Dark City and is patiently awaiting the return of Elias, who went off to find Annah's sister, Abigail. Annah and Elias left Abigail behind in the Forest of Hands and Teeth ten years ago while fleeing the Unconsecrated. Since then Annah has regretted the decision every day. Her guilt is visibly represented on her flesh by severe scars, an accident caused by barbed wire. Annah thinks of her sister and knows that she herself is ugly.Three people come into the city that irrevocably change Annah's life. One is Elias, the man Annah is in love with. Another is Gabry, Annah's sister, who is in love with Elias as well. The third is Catcher, the Immune former flame of Gabry. All three of these characters serve as a symbolic counterpoint for Annah in provocative ways. They also make a very impacting point in the story. Because of Catcher's immunity the Recruiters (who secure the defenses in Dark City) have forced him to infiltrate the infected areas for supplies. To keep him in line they imprison Annah, Gabry, and Elias but they really only need to keep one alive to maintain Catcher's loyalty. The threat of their deaths are ever-present in (and out) of Dark City.I really like what Ryan did with this book. Granted, it took me a minute to get into the storyline but once Gabry and co. made their presence known I was hooked. Annah is a hard character to wrap your brain around. I wasn't convinced, at first, that I was going to like her voice. I wasn't sure I was ready for her darkness. She's a completely different character than the first two women; her inner strength comes from years of self-loathing more than success. I was scared of how dark she was in the beginning, but I quickly grew to appreciate her, to love her. I really grew to love her.This is, potentially, the darkest book in the series. But it's not because of the dead, it's because of the living. The things that people do, the things that people become in order to survive, are truly monstrous, and Ryan drives this home with efficient grace. It's not the undead we need fear, it's ourselves. Beautifully, masterfully done.I'm really glad that I had this book to read this week. Really. Very. Glad.5 out of 5 stars.

This last book \"The Dark and Hollow Places\" is a sequel to \"The Dead Tossed Waves\", I started skimming about mid book because I thought it was getting a little bit boring and repetitive.

Not only does her writing increase in perfection with each book, but she creates a world that feels so real while reading it, that I hopelessly and willingly fall victim to it's brilliance. Yes I know zombies aren't real, but they sure feel real when you're reading Carrie's series. I can honestly say I am NOT a zombie fan, but I'm a die hard Carrie Ryan zombie fan. There's a difference, as Carrie's main characters are not zombies, but the world in which they live is over run with them.The Dark and Hollow Places lives up to it's name and is the darker of the three, but it also made it the most realistic. Without giving away any spoilers, what happens with the characters in the story wasn't shocking to me and is something that fits a story who's world is facing an end. This is something that felt real and something I can see really happening, as human nature takes over. People either fight to survive or become barbaric and let me just say that a few of the Recruiters make the zombies look nice.What I've loved about this series is that each book is from a different character's point of view, and each story is told in manner that I not only get to see the characters in a variety of ways, but also their world. What I loved most with this story is the way in which Carrie brings all her characters together and wraps up her series. The Dark and Hollow Places is told from Annah's point of view, Gabry's twin sister. I really enjoyed getting to know Annah, and I loved the romance that grows between her and Catcher. It's so broken, and hopeful all at the same time and filled with tension, which I love. I really fell in love with Catcher in TDTW, but this time his desperation is so much more urgent that I really wanted to reach out to him. Annah and Catcher mold together perfectly, as they're the only ones who are able to really understand each other. I'm so glad that Gabry and Elias were apart of the story, but this time they were great supporting characters.The setting in which the story takes place really helps set the tone and feel of the book. Dark City is overrun and falling apart and it's the last strong hold survivors have. The darkened subway tunnels are beyond creepy! My adrenaline started running while reading these scenes they're that creepy, but so fitting for the story. While the setting makes the world and the story feel helpless, the characters give it hope, which was so appealing to me. Annah for me is the essence of survival. Her passion for living really brought the story to life. She often questions the way in which she was changing and how could she not? She's had to deal with some pretty horrific things both from what she's seen and experienced. She won't give up, even when all seems lost.I truly loved the moments I spent being apart of the world Carrie created. With The Dark and Hollow Place I had a few of those \"ah ha\" moments when Carrie ties together her previous two story lines, and adds them to this story's deliciously twisted plot. And oh what an ending! It's biter sweet, hopeful, and exactly how a series should end. If you have not picked up Carrie's series, I highly recommend it. The Dark and Hollow Places is a must have book and I recommend running out today to pick up."}, {"userName": "Lola", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2891935-lola", "userReview": "It seems to be happening a lot to me lately first with the next part if the Gone series and now this too...

In the Dark City where lawlessness prevails Annah learned quickly what it takes to fend for herself. She's had to be strong in order to survive. Because of street smarts and childhood accident that left part of her face and body marred Annah's been fortunate to fend off creepers and the like. Unfortunately the very same scars cause Annah to keep everyone at arms length. She walks the streets with her head down, speaking only when necessary and has no friends or acquaintances. She's literally all on her own as she waits for Elias to return to her. Near the beginning of The Dark and Hollow Places Annah makes the decision to move on--Elias has been gone three years when he only signed up for two. She knows that there is a good chance he's dead or worse. She knows it's foolish to continue living in the same building they lived in together as it's been declared unsafe and the city is getting more dangerous every day. It's when she's leaving the city for what's supposed to be the last time she sees a teenage girl who has her face, or rather the face she would have were it not for all the scars. Annah knows without a doubt the girl is her long-lost identical twin, Abigail, whom she and Elias left in the forest all those years ago. Guilt-stricken, there hasn't been a day in which Annah hasn't thought about Abigail, about her fate--whether she found her way back to their village or not. Annah attempts to get to Abigail who, ironically enough, is entering the Dark City. She fails because of the excessive, though entirely necessary security measures in place. Helplessly she watches Abigail pass by, hoping she can locate her after she returns to the city. Around the same time a young man, also entering the city, becomes the focus of nearly everybody's attention when security dogs start barking at him, identifying him as infected. Turns out Abigail is traveling with the young man and helps him escape from the peacekeepers. In turn they take her into custody while Annah looks on, horrified. And this, folks, is when things get truly interesting but I'm going to have to finish reviewing this book later as my five year old needs attention RIGHT NOW! (Seriously, the world might just end if I don't do her bidding.)----Original short review:More like 3.9 stars but I went ahead and rounded it up because it is the series finale and it ended well. The protagonist is the strongest Ryan has written to-date, though a little too much of a tortured soul from time to time. There are times in which I found myself choking on her pain, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's just that Ryan writes heartbreak and rejection so well, I found myself sort of reliving some of the nastier, best-left-forgotten experiences from my adolescence. I was choking on bitterness on the MC's behalf and I even hated the 'other girl'. So glad I'm no longer a teenager, but I digress.I'll write a full review when I get to my computer as typing this out from a phone isn't very fun."}, {"userName": "usagi \u2606\u30df", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1101220-usagi", "userReview": "Picking up right where we left off at the end of \"The Dead-Tossed Waves\", \"The Dark and Hollow Places\" ups the pace of the story, making us feel just as desperate as the rest of the main characters thus far.This last third book in the trilogy (though I really, really hope there are others!) unites all of the characters we've met since the first book together in a frenetic union of panic and love, lust and hurt. Annah's love of her sister combined with the hate that springs forth once she learns how Abagail/Gabry grew up is a tasty treat, sweet and sour, to be enjoyed slowly as it simmers to a head near the middle of the book. Just as the first book was Mary's story and the second was Gabry's, make no mistake that this last story in the trilogy belongs to Annah and Ryan never lets us forget that. We're deeply immersed in Annah and her psyche the entire time, and how she fights with herself on whether she loves or hates her sister, Catcher, and Elias.Between this and the panic spurred on by the actions of Catcher, Elias, and Gabry at the end of the previous book, it feels like you're on a marathon - heart pounding, lactic acid in your legs the entire time. And it burns - teenage love in the middle of a world that's ending. But it burns so, so good. Ryan has only honed and perfected her craft of agonized teenage affection throughout all three books, which is really well represented in this last story. And then there's the generational aspect as well; Mary's story was the first story, somewhere around 20 years previous to the second book. By the end of this third book, you get the feeling that things have come full circle, that there is hope, another generation to be born, and even though they may have to fight for their lives, they WILL live.That, ultimately, I think is Ryan's message: if there's life there's hope, and if there's hope, there's love. And that's what makes us different from the dead, just as Annah says in the book - the fact that we're aware and fight for these emotions makes us alive, makes us fallible, but makes us human. This is the line that separates us from the dead.I really hope there are more books in the world of \"Hands and Teeth\" - \"Hare Moon\", a novella just released online (which I haven't had a chance to read yet), apparently also takes place in the same universe. But I'd like a prequel, maybe something to answer what happened to cause the Return, or a sequel/separate trilogy of what happened after this last book. I won't take no for an answer.This one's in my top five for 2011 so far, and the year's not even over yet.

What are you living for if the Unconsecrated swarm the earth in hoards, claiming any and all life they can come in contact with? Do you get sick of fighting and running, always surviving just to survive, doing whatever it takes to survive? Carrie Ryan sends all these questions (and much more!) through your mind with the final book in her Forest of Hands and Teeth trilogy, The Dark and Hollow Places.This book was an amazing finish to such a remarkable series. I love a writer who gives you something, say, a present, wrapped in pretty pink paper. This gift is so amazing, and the author allows it to grow in your heart, then rips it right back out, roughs it up some, okay, roughs it up A LOT, and then hands it back to you, wrapped in pretty new paper and says, \"okay, this time you can have it. Maybe.\" That is what reading this book is like. I adored it. I adored the torture that some scenes were, the humanity that the characters attempt to preserve and the love that perseveres through all hopelessness.Another thing that is SO great about this trilogy is how each book is told from a different (and possibly new) character's POV, yet they are all intertwined so deeply, and rooted to each other. I love that each book introduces new characters and man, do the characters in these books ROCK YOUR FACE OFF. I loved how Annah tried to learn what she was really fight for and how Catcher tried to learn to be unbroken. Everything on the surface was about survival, but underneath is was so, so SO much deeper. Gabry and Elias were great complimentary characters whereas, in the volume before this book, The Dead-Tossed Waves, they really were the show. Their back story was plenty strong enough to allow them to reinforce the third books plot without rehashing too much of the plot of the series in TDAHP.I am grateful that authors like Carrie Ryan exist to torture us; it expands our horizons and thoughts in different ways. It doesn't always give us the \"fairy-tale ending\" but it helps to show us how adversity can create opportunities for us and reshape the way we see things. Just because something is different, doesn't mean it's bad. This book is SUCH a great example of that. Even though as a reader I flt hopelessness and despair during the course of events in this book, the characters never stopped hoping and believing that a better way existed. They knew it didn't have to be perfect, but that if they didn't just have to keep \"surviving,\" they could really, truly live.I've never been into \"zombie drama\" stories or movies, but Carrie Ryan takes the undead to a whole new level. I love the suspense, the horror, the romance that makes surviving not just a matter of saving your own life, but of someone else's, and every other emotion and feeling this book (and series) evokes. This series is one of the best I've ever read and it absolutely graces the top of my \"Favorite Series\" list. Even if you think you don't like zombie stories, you need to read this series. If you were a fan of Forest of Hands and Teeth and The Dead-Tossed Waves, then I don't know why you're reading this review and not reading The Dark and Hollow Places. If you don't read this book, I hear you turn into a Mudo.

The world has ended, there are a few survivors trying to scrabble out an increasingly difficult and futile existence, and of course, the teenagers are smarter, faster and better than the adults. More so than the other two books, the teenagers in The Dark and Hollow Places, were cast as \"good,\" and the adults were unrelentingly bad, obstructionist, and in some cases, plain old vanilla stupid. Still, I felt like I had to finish the series, and find out what happened to Gabry/Abigail from the book 2 cliffhanger. Fortunately, it's a quick and easy read, even if Annah's continual whining about her scars, and Catcher's \"heat\" got really old after about 50 pages. Not especially recommended, but if you've read this far, you might as well finish the series."}, {"userName": "Vaso", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15818014-vaso", "userReview": "\u0388\u03c6\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae \u03b7 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac! \u039a\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf! \u039a\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b7\u03c1\u03c9\u03af\u03b4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5, \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2. \u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc happy ending, \u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7 Carrie Ryan \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf!!"}, {"userName": "Lofinka", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30624030-lofinka", "userReview": "OMG! No gif can describe my feelings after reading this book.First impression: The second book was better, come onnn. Second impression: The Death-Tossed Waves disappointed, this is Champion! Dear Lord!In Dark and Hollow Places is the main heroine Annah, the twin of Abigail which we all know as Gabry from The Death-Tossed Waves. Annah lives in a Dark City where she's waiting for his friend Elias, whom had fled from the village. A Few years ago he left to join the crimps for a couple of years to provide the service themselves and Anna safe, but it doesn't return for a long time and Annah isn't going to wait any longer. She decides to retire from the dangerous city and find a better life somewhere far away. It was at her departure but she sees his sister on the way to the city, so she stayed. Everything happens next will start the chain of events leading to a huge denouement:  Can the human race survive in the final battle against unclean (or whatever)?Yes, this book offers a huge finale. It is full of action, emotion and also is boasting my favorite heroine of this series. But the biggest plus is somewhere else. How dark and catastrophic this book is. One might expect it by name, but I guess no one can prepare to future like this only based on name. How far Carrie Ryan chased her vision of the Dark City really surprised me. As I said, Annah is my favorite heroine from this series. She's strong, harsh and brave. Even here, however, appear Carrie's shortcomings of previous books. Annah is too much thinking sometimes. She's still discussing her guilt she feels towards his sister (I survived that, yay!) but she's still discussing her feelings for boys. Yes, there's a love triangle AGAIN, although now it's more like a square. As we know, Gabry was dating Catcher, but she fell in love with Elias after his transformation. Well, Annah was in love with Elias, but the more she was recognized Catcher, the more she was detached of that feelings (especially when he licked her twin)and, of course, she begins to discuss her growing feelings for Catcher. And here we go...I didn't like Catcher very much. I noticed one thing in this series - when there are two boys in one book, one is good and a second is bad, literally literally as BAD. He's rude, mad. And in this book I found that Catcher isn't that bad, neither rude or mad. Maybe he's more attractive than Elias. And that scene when he was crying and hugging Annah in her bed was just ohhh...O:-) Fearful caution on the topic of sex. Little spoiler - I think that last night of Anna and Elias, before he joined the crimps. Did you also thought that they, as it were, came to the last base? Were you also surprised that they were just ''kissing''? Because Annah Although can undress to the waist ahead of Catcher (left her pants and shoes) or take his hands and put them on her breasts, but God forbid that they were doing something more than kissing and making out together! You know what? Bullshit.Well, that's just something I noticed and want to get out of my head. When I let out that love triangle (square) and thinking about the past, it was really great book and super ending of this series. I really enjoyed Dark and Hollow Places and it's just a pity that there are no more books similar to this one!"}, {"userName": "Nely", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1440151-nely", "userReview": "In the third and final installment in her Forest of Hands and Teeth series, Carrie Ryan, introduces you to Annah. Annah has been living on her own in the Dark City since Elias left to join the protectorate. With scars that mar her face and body, Annah is more of a recluse. She uses her street smarts - bowing her head, not making eye contact and blending into the shadows as a weapon. Without any friends or family she has used these skills as a way to survive the dangers of the Dark City. Waiting for Elias, her life has become as lifeless as that of the Unconsecrated but then she meets Catcher. Catcher who brings with him memories of a past that she has longed to forget.Out of the three leading ladies you will find in this series, Annah was hands down my favorite. She wasn't a whiner like Mary, and Gabry annoyed me with all her boy drama... but Annah was phenomenal. She was tough as nails, brave, strong and courageous. Her will to live was a breath of fresh air. Even though she's scarred, feels alone and even broken at times - she still was not willing to give up. Out of the three books I believe this was the darkest one. Their struggle for survival was the most intense. I went through a slew of emotions from sadness, hopelessness, and even found myself choked up more than once. I can't even imagine a life this bleak where the unconsecrated are a threat but humans can be just as dangerous. Yet through it all I found myself hopeful. I found myself waiting for and really savoring the moments that weren't as dark... moments of light. Especially when those moments dealt with Annah and Catcher's relationship. The fact that they are both so broken and flawed really makes you hope that they can find a way to make it work in a world infested by the living dead. Originally, I was worried that I wouldn't like this final installment since I was so focused on Gabry and Elias's story (The Dead-Tossed Waves) but I think Ms. Ryan did a wonderful job in connecting everything together. Overall this book was incredible. The whole series is amazing. Full of tension, suspense, nail-biting action and Unconsecrated... lots and lots of Unconsecrated. I can't recommend it enough!"}, {"userName": "\u2605 Jess ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2683062-jess", "userReview": "Hands down the best book I have read this year, and easily the strongest installment of this trilogy-which is now my second favorite of all time, second to only\"Chaos Walking\" The Forest of Hands and Teeth was worth 4.5 stars The Dead-Tossed Waves was worth 4 stars This finale is worth almost six. It was magnificent. It takes place in a dying New York City, at least 200 years into the future. This is now called \"The Dark City\"-one of the last safe places on a dead earth. The descriptions & imagery that Carrie Ryan uses throughout the book is magnificent-some images I will never be able to remove from my mind-both beautiful & terribly haunting at the same time: -The dead and rotting New York skyline at dawn, with a handful of fires flickering in each building , being one of the said images. I typed six more, but all of them were mega-spoilers, and thats not on. The third book is narrated by a third protagonist-Annah, and she is the most likable and interesting yet. Everything I type will not do justice to this thrilling book...so yeah. Just read it. Its written well, paced terrifically, the characters are wonderful and the dark atmosphere is sensational. I just wanted to pull Annah out of the book and comfort her. And the ending...oh wow. I am considering making a goodreads shelf for 'best climaxes' just for this book. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SOOOO MUCH! Ive tried recommending this series to my friends, but they just scoff: \"Zombies...thats so stupid!\"But no, its not. The zombies/unconcencrated/Mudo/Plauge Rats are not the base of this story. Its all about human nature, survival, love -and mostly: the power of hope. Please, please, please, please: Read this trilogy."}, {"userName": "Sesana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana", "userReview": "[Let me break down what happens in the romance: Elias and Annah grow up as brother and sister. At some point, she falls into a barbed wire fence and becomes heavily scarred over half her body, which understandably gives her some issues. Elias and Annah (who have, I remind you, been brother and sister for years) start to fall in love, which isn't squicky at all. However, Elias decides that he doesn't want to deal with Annah's issues and runs off. While away, he meets Gabry, Annah's identical twin sister. Who has no scars. Cue insta-love on his part. I don't think I need to elaborate on how much this bothered me. But wait, it's not over yet! Early in the book, Elias, Gabry, Annah, and Catcher meet up. In the prior book, Gabry had rejected Catcher in favor of Elias. But then he meets Annah, identical to Gabry save the scars, and boom! Insta-love. It's appallingly obvious that Catcher is using her as a stand-in for Gabry, at least at first.

"userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1271874-amy-nielsen", "userReview": "Where oh where do we begin? The ONLY reason I continued beyond book 2 was that I hoped beyond hope that something awesome might happen and somehow this crew would whip the zombie's butts and create a new world. Well, since I gave up on this book in the last 20 minutes of it (audiobook), it's not looking like that happened, unless it happened super fast. No, I wouldn't have normally given up that close to the end but my library loan ended and I just don't care what finally happened to stupid Annah in the tunnels in the frigid air. Yes, say frigid air out loud and see if you don't laugh out loud. Because I heard it repeatedly like 7 times and I was like, wha? what is she talking about a refrigerator for? I understand the air is cold, but is this author so completely devoid of imagination that the only words she can use to describe cold air repeatedly is frigid air?Stupid similes, something is always \"like\" something else in a totally long-winded annoying way. The stupid self-talk continues as in the other books and random bits of tedious unimportant information that is forever fed to the reader. This is not good literature - it is annoying fluff. Annah is a self-pitying reject who has no original idea of her own and trusts no one and yet falls in love with Catcher without any real reason that I can see. Let's talk about Catcher for a second though. This is a boy as 2 dimensional as the pages of the book. This boy is totally into Annah's twin sister for all of book 2 and decides he can't be with her because it's too big of a risk. And yet, 1 day later (okay maybe a week later) he meets Gabry's twin sister, scarred and broken, and falls in love too - again, with no reason that is made clear to us. And yet although Annah is Gabry's twin, she's the ugly twin. But Catcher's willing to sacrifice all of his scruples for the ugly twin - and not even the nice ugly twin. She's the mean, ugly twin. I don't get this 2 dimensional stuff. And so we don't get enough information as to why the relationships go in the directions they do, and yet we know exactly minute inconsequential events occur. Here are a few examples of extraneous sentences that tell us nothing and waste space:1) My heart's pounding so furiously that I don't know if it will ever calm down again. (steller lit there)2) I'm punching and screaming and kicking and twisting and fighting as...[really, because i thought you were having a peaceful stroll] - are there no better words to describe the fact that she's fighting back? and and and. please.3) I'm so focused on on the Recruiters that I don't notice another body slip into the room. I don't notice him make his way along the edge of the wall. (this constant repeating of the same phrase is so prevalent in this book - redundancy for the sake of making an impression is poor writing IMHO).And the partial sentences are so grating (ya partial sentence intended). I can't stand poor grammar from an author. If you are going to write, please don't insult my intelligence by using poor grammar. There is no excuse. It is not cool, trendy or whatever it is you're hoping to achieve. It just makes you look like a marginal amateur author.Last but not least, the narrator for this book was terrible. She made all of the author's flaws 100% more apparent. I know this because I went onto Google Books and looked up the book so I could actually read it, and it wasn't quite so bad. Which tells me that the narrator was an amateur too. Please blow your nose before you read - ya, really.*SPOILER*I know that other people gave this book and the 2 before it really good reviews. But frankly I am more discerning with my spare time and I feel like I just wasted it. I look back over the 3 books and feel like so very little of any monument actually happened and the end of book 3 was a joke - how convenient that a group of completely untrained \"children\" could come up with such a viable option and create this complex aircraft for their escape. Made from quilts and oil? It didn't burn up? No trial run? Right. It makes about as much sense as the whole rest of this ridiculous series."}, {"userName": "Greta is Erikasbuddy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3267545-greta-is-erikasbuddy", "userReview": "I adore this series.I was skeptical at first but I always am. I just can't hand the lip gloss dot your eyes with wash and curl kind of books.This series isn't one of them. These books made me squee with delight as each girl endured a loss sprikled torture but found love in the most unsuspecting of places.I loved the insert zombie here and make it a bit rougher than your normal hard knock life kinda story. It was a very interesting world. Dare I say better than Harry Potter? I actually do say because I know Hogwarts would never accept me but the Forest would welcome me with open arms, the Waves would try to take me away, and those Hollow Places would be a nice blanket when I tried to hide my head. Plus, I'm one of those weirdos who could never get into the Potter books.--- that's not really telling you what the book is about, is it?Well, I'd like to tell you everything. I really would, but you see... it would totally wreck the first 2 books for you if you haven't read them.So, to those who have read the series: I really enjoyed what I read.To those of you who haven't read the series: I highly recommend it. I would have loved to have read a series like this when I was thirteen and up (I'm sure a 12 year old could handle it but there are some graphic violence that parents might want to censor till the child gets a bit older and won't wind up in their bed when the wind rattles the tree branch against their window-- FYI: TEETH scared me so bad that I thought my house was infested with zombies for a time lolz)I enjoyed this series way more than the Beautiful one. It's about neck and neck with the Iron one but that's only because both of those worlds are just so different and unique that they tie in different ways. The originality of the zombie apocalypse has been done before but the plot was one of a kind and very imaginative. I also enjoyed how each book was done by a different girl's point of view. That really wowed me. The way the author linked everyone up but made each story different was amazing.I have to admit that this is NOT a stand-alone book. If you picked up \"DARK\" you could probably get away from reading \"TEETH\" but you could NOT get away from reading \"WAVES\". I had a hard time remembering what happened in the second book so I recommend reading WAVES and DARK back to back if you can. IF you can't it is fine. THe stories that you might not remember are explained to you but you'll be brain farting for a while until then. (I know I was).I now want to read all the short anthology stories that have been written in this land. I want to disect this world a little more. While I am sad that this was the final book I am very satisfied with the way that it ended. -song that I kept thinking of throughout the book: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLL6ON..."}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "I feel like I\u2019ve been through an emotional wringer for the last two evenings. If you\u2019re looking for a feel good zombie book with a happy ending to the horror filled flesh eating monster series, do not look here. At no point in the reading of this entire series have I ever had happy feelings. That being said, this is a series that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Maybe I shelter myself with romance too often. In my endless search for literary escape, do I miss out on these thought provoking gems? Even if that\u2019s the case, I just don\u2019t think I could handle the gut wrenching hopelessness that permeates the Forest of Hands and Teeth series. I don\u2019t really want to think of how I would react to the last days of my life, or what I would do if my husband or heaven forbid, children\u2026tried to eat me. Ms Ryan is an amazing author. Truly, the thoughts she must have in her head to be able to come up with this entire world, the characterization and imagery that she creates is stunning. No matter how much I say I don\u2019t ever read this type of book, I have to give props to her. She is an artist with words, painting a vivid dystopian society that feels so real! I swear I heard moans coming from my front porch, and New York City really IS being swallowed by the horde of Unconsecrated. Someone better check on that.What would humanity do if they were in this situation? Is this what people turn into? Those in power preying on the weak, building cities just so they can control, rape, murder? It\u2019s a scary world to live in, and I\u2019m so very angry that the bad guys don\u2019t get what they deserve. The torture that they dish out is atrocious. They prey on the weak, and Anna\u2019s inner good girl made me want to shake her. Doesn\u2019t she deserve justice? Don\u2019t the other victims deserve some form of retribution? Buck up, little girl! The horrors taking place around you, the inhumanity of the humans who are meant to protect you needs to stop! That bothered me more than anything else.The ending, I\u2019m sure everyone knows by now, if they\u2019ve read any other reviews, is wholly dissatisfying. I felt like Mrs. Ryan just\u2026got tired of writing escape attempts. So she tack on a paragraph or two that screams \u201cTHE END\u201d and left it at that. Don\u2019t her readers DESERVE some form of happy? Or at the very least some sort of finality? Something, ANYTHING to give us a hint as to what this struggle has all been for? No, we don\u2019t. I wish we did. I could have given this the fifth star. As it is, I\u2019m so very angry right now that I can\u2019t think straight. I want to rant and rant and pitch a fit. But I shall refrain and move on with my life. I almost hope there isn\u2019t another book, because I know I\u2019d feel like I have to read it. How amazing that a person can bring out these emotions in so many readers. What a fabulous accomplishment and what a great job she did. Bravo to Carrie Ryan. Now write a freaking epilogue!!"}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4277731-jon", "userReview": "Check out more reviews at Scott Reads It!  \"Sometimes life isn't about the end. It's not always about tomorrow and the day after that-what we achieve over the years and how we leave the world. Sometimes it's about today.\"  I was a bit reluctant to read The Dark And Hollow Places for two reasons. I have read tons of trilogies and the 3rd book in a trilogy almost always manages to disappoint me. I usually don't like how authors resolve trilogies because the conclusions usually feel way too rushed. Second of all, it sounds kind of juvenile but I avoided reading this book because I didn't want this series to end. The Dark And Hollow Places is an extremely satisfying conclusion that definitely exceeded all of my expectations. Carrie Ryan is truly a literary genius. Only Carrie Ryan could make a zombie book into something so beautiful and emotionally powerful. The Dark And Hollow Places filled me with hope and yet at the same time it broke my heart and shattered it into a million pieces. No matter how hopeless a situation may seem, no situation is entirely hopeless.  Annah is so different from Mary and Gabry but I still loved her nevertheless. Annah is extremely insecure about herself but you really can't blame her. Some readers will probably find Annah irritating but her insecurity is really a result of her situation. Even though everything feels so bleak and hopeless, Annah is determined to continue to fight each and every day.If I was in the situation that Annah was, I highly doubt I'd be as hopeful or determined as she was. I really loved watching Annah evolve as a person and accept who she is.  The Dark And Hollow Places is even more horrifying than both The Forest And Hands Of Teeth and The Dead Tossed Waves. Everything feels even more bleak and hopeless in this book. Carrie Ryan takes advantage of the situation and uses the setting to put across some thought provoking messages. What does it mean to be human? When is it okay to give up? Is life worth living without hope?  Some people have complained about how this series ended because it's a bit open ended. I found the ending extremely satisfying and it was a truly perfect ending. I don't want to give anything way but I loved the ending! The Dark And Hollow Places is a thought-provoking conclusion to one of my all-time favorite series. I really look forward to reading more of Carrie Ryan's books and I hope I enjoy them as much as I enjoyed this book. I'd highly recommend reading all of The Forest Of Hands And Teeth books and I believe these books really deserve the hype they receive!"}], "description": "There are many things that Annah would like to forget: the look on her sister's face before Annah left her behind in the Forest of Hands and Teeth, her first glimpse of the Horde as they swarmed the Dark City, the sear of the barbed wire that would scar her for life. But most of all, Annah would like to forget the morning Elias left her for the Recruiters. Annah's world stopped that day, and she's been waiting for Elias to come home ever since. Somehow, without him, her life doesn't feel much different than the dead that roam the wasted city around her. Until she meets Catcher, and everything feels alive again.But Catcher has his own secrets. Dark, terrifying truths that link him to a past Annah has longed to forget, and to a future too deadly to consider. And now it's up to Annah: can she continue to live in a world covered in the blood of the living?
