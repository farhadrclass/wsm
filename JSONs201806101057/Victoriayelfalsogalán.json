Yes please.Victoria is a sassy, independent heroine with an endearing bossy streak. Practical to the core, she has no time for female swooning fits, or day-dreaming about handsome men. Victoria\u2019s mission in life is to help people with her sound (if often unwanted) advice. I just had to laugh at how Victoria went around re-organising everyone\u2019s life (for the better of course) so subtly that no one even notices. Victoria cannot help helping people and I was amused that her bossiness had caused her rather alarmed bachelor Uncles to ship her of to another country for some peace.There are lots of delightful moments in this book \u2013 I especially enjoyed the sisterly relationship that developed between Victoria and her cousin Rebecca, and Jacob Carstairs!I\u2019ll let you discover Jacob Carstairs for yourselves But I will say I don\u2019t blame the poor girl finding herself all hot and bothered and tongue-tied around him once he turns on the charm.You don\u2019t really need me to sell a Meg Cabot book to you do you? There\u2019s romance, balls, gowns, scandal, a handsome rogue and even a spot of kidnapping. What more could a girl want?"}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "Best YA Romance I have ever read -- the perfect steppingstone to classic Regency!I gave PANTS ON FIRE by Meg Cabot only two stars, but I am proud to give this story a full five or even more! So strange, this is a Regency novel and yet the heroine, Victoria, is more well-rounded, more assertive, and more independent by far than obnoxious Katie in the contemporary PANTS ON FIRE. All of Victoria's strong points, her self-confidence, courage, and her desire to organize and improve the world around her, are presented with great charm. And her weaknesses, (which are really strengths) are just the same!The hero is Jacob Carstairs, a pretty typical rake, except he works for a living. He's barely out of his teens and yet he's already a ship's captain, which really captures his relaxed yet self-confident personality perfectly. His attitude towards Victoria is amused, but NEVER condescending. He loves the fact that she feels like she can manage everyone, except him. And she can manage all her feelings, except the ones he sparks within her!And speaking of sparks, if you think a \"kisses only\" teen Regency can't have some truly spectacular sexual tension and some very grown up heat between two attractive young people, think again! Meg Cabot has written every type of book you can think of -- but I wish she'd written a few more like this one."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily", "userReview": "[Victoria escape her abductor without having too much outside help (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58398557-ana", "userReview": "Apesar de gostar bastante dos livros da autora, n\u00e3o gostei muito deste, ficou bastante abaixo das minhas expectativas."}, {"userName": "Sheila Ng", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16185183-sheila-ng", "userReview": "I really find this very cute!!!The story is simple and predictable, but it has this spark that will let you ask for what's next. We have Victoria, daughter of a Indian duke, who was shipped to England to look for a husband. She fell in love at first sight with the handsome Earl of Malfrey - Hugo who also confessed his love for her in an instant, but there is this one person who kept on annoying her and that's none other than Captain Jacob Carstairs. Based on the synopsis given above/from the book you could already predict who is the rogue and who ends up with who. One thing that I would commend upon is the character development/realizations especially on Victoria. Given that she is the daughter of a duke, she is expected to be perfect or strong willed and all, but she has her imperfections, kinda nice to see main characters having flaws than none at all. There are a few issues raised or morals taught in the story such as those about how love and hate go hand in hand, love vs money and also being wanted vs being needed.Overall it's a nice read if you don't mind cliches and just want a sweet, warm young adult story. I just wished more was revealed as to why/how/since when did Captain Carstairs fell in love with her, or maybe it just goes to say that love needs no reason and just happens.Kinda reminded me of some animes like Kaichou wa Maid-sama and Skip Beat."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2150074-rebecca", "userReview": "Victoria Arbuthnot was just four years old when her parents died while the family was visiting India.

On the long sea journey from India to London, Victoria meets Hugo Rothschild, the ninth early of Malfrey, who proposes to her shortly before the journey's end. Victoria is thrilled with the proposal. But why is Jacob Carstairs, who was also a passenger on the ship, trying to get her to end her engagement? Now that they are in London, why won't he just leave Victoria alone? And why is she even attracted to such an infuriating man as Jacob? And is Hugo hiding a terrible secret? I enjoyed this book even more than Meg Cabot's first Avon True Romance.

Expect a lot of fluff, a lot of flirting, a lot of naivety, and a lot of cliches. Does that make it bad? No, because if you're going into this expecting something deeper, you've picked up the wrong book. This is a harmless \"junk food\" read, with an unreliable narrator who you either wish to strangle or just shake your head at them and sigh affectionately. Victoria is a 16-year-old pampered, orphaned heiress, who is just self-absorbed enough to believe she should rule over everyone's lives because she knows best (supposedly), but also has a kind heart that has nothing but good intentions toward those around her. She's stubborn and naive, but also free-spirited and feisty. She's the kind of heroine I would have had very mixed feelings about when I was younger, but now that I'm an adult, I just shake my head and laugh at her foolishness. We were all 16 and stupid at one, or we will be someday. Let her grow and change. And she does! (Eventually.) All in all, this was a sweet little dive into the world of \"romance novels,\" which is my reading theme this month, so now I'm far more willing to look forward to my next romantic reads...."}, {"userName": "Mermarie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8250586-mermarie", "userReview": "Woman forced to admit she's wrong for the first time.

Light and fluffy, a book to cosy up with. I also really liked the style of writing; each sentence drew me in and I became so consumed in the story, I started to feel the emotions Victoria was feeling. I'm sure I was pulling some funny faces when she was so frustrated and annoyed with Jacob Carstairs, as I started to get just as wound up, despite the fact that I thought he was hilarious.I loved the character of Victoria. She was so much fun and not the character I was expecting to see, so that was a pleasant surprise. She was really funny actually - and original. She was bossy, smart and independent. She did things entirely her own way. She also had a need of helping others, which really just meant that she told them what to do, though this was with the best intentions. I enjoyed reading about her greatly.Jacob Carstairs was another great character I couldn't help but fall in love with. I'm a sucker in literature for the snarky git - when done right, of course. His conversations with Victoria were so amusing to read about. And he steadily grew more adorable. I loved how he never lost his cool and had a easy confidence about him.

In fact, Victoria not only knows that her considerable wealth plays a part in her fiance\u2019s proposal, but thinks it absolutely right that it would be. Even better, she\u2019s well-informed about love affairs in general and is far from shocked when her fianc\u00e9 is called a \u201crogue\u201d but instead, asks in what precise way.
