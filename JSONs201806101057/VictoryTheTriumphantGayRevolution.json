Hirshman's focus here is on the American gay rights movement and it's meteoric ascent in the last 60 years, not on American gay culture as a whole. She does an excellent job of examining how that history developed, going all the way back to the 1920's and 1930's and showing the development of the first informal, hopelessly ineffective gay organizations and groups decades before phrases like 'Stonewall' 'Harvey Milk' and 'ACT UP' would mean anything to anyone.And the books earliest chapters reveal a pre-WWII gay culture that, while hideously mistreated, was also shockingly vibrant and even quite brazen at times. And she also tacitly puts up an alternative to the rather idiotic, and cheaply accepted notion that it was entirely the upheaval of WWII that really \"made\" modern gay culture happen. As she rightly points out, the simple fact of urbanization (arguably the most basic, widely felt social phenomenon of modernity), of young men and women moving into large cities for more opportunities and then being able to pursue their romantic interests away from the constraints of small town family life is, more than any other force, what first brought gay people together at all.Hirschman takes a wide approach, and at times the dizzying array of different organizations and figures she casually mentions as being of supreme importance seldom get more than a few sentences describing them. Victory is more interested in the broad trends than in elevating any single person or organization as being the real banner carrier of the gay rights movement. Though, as any reader will come to realize, Larry Kramer and ACT UP, and it's lively response to the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s is the real high water mark of direct action. In fact ACT UP, with its brazen public demonstrations carried out at a time when being gay became nearly equated with a death sentence, really kind of set the standards for how any post-60's protests should be organized, even into our own time.For all the strengths of Hirschman's research and her very smart observations about why certain gay and lesbian initiatives succeeded or failed when they did, the book is marred down by her over-reliance on the Rousseauan idea of the social contract, which she tries to squeeze every fact into with weird, occasionally confused results. And the moments when she really delves into the byzantine wording of various gay rights court cases and the legal theories behind them kind of made my eyes glaze over, but then I'm not a high powered attorney. This book is the product of a brilliant legal mind, but Hirschman's analysis in the later part of the book never really steps beyond the realm of purely legal considerations and examines the gay rights movement in a broader, more holistic context. The progress of gay rights in the last half century is an incredible story, but this book often feels more like a victory lap than a real, in-depth examination of that history. And like many books about gay and lesbian rights, it's already dated."}, {"userName": "Catherine Woodman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912889-catherine-woodman", "userReview": "The author goes through a century of the history of the slow but steady change towards equal rights for gay men and women in the United States. The going was tough, after a remarkably good step forward during Prohibition (when the culture of doing things that were not condoned by the main stream became almost main stream by virtue of prevalence), but the book does not have a downbeat tone--quite the contrary, it is uplifting throughout.The author does not waste any time defending the concept that homosexuals require equal rights--she very appropriately has that as a given. Her contention is that because gays are so much like straight folks it led to a longer time for us all to figure out that we have friends, family members, and co-workers who are gay, and this delay in recognition did the gay community no favors. She argues that it was HIV and AIDS that brought the issue of gay rights to the forefront, for two reasons. One was that it was no longer possible to deny that Uncle Leo was gay--once AIDS was in full epidemic, people became reluctantly openly gay. The equally important effect was that the gay community became an effective and powerful lobby. They worked first for treatment options for HIV, but the networks that developed went on to lobby for gay rights in all walks of life. THe most recent battle grounds--military service and marriage--have taken dramatic strides forward this past several years.The book is a wonderful read, but it is especially strong in the area of Supreme Court rulings related to gay rights."}, {"userName": "Frank Sloth Aaskov", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7194749-frank-sloth-aaskov", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the book which invites you on a journey of American gay civil rights through the last 80 years. It has a strict focus on civil liberties and rights and the official attitude towards the LGBT citizens such as the psychiatrists' classification of LGBT peopleas mentally ill, sodomy laws and funding for AIDS research. It did not focus on the change in public opinions, the change in the framing of LGBT people in the media or what caused this change, but instead focused on the social movement alone. Although the other aspects would have been interesting, and I at times missed them, it would also have diluted the book which is already 350 pages. It is still however a very interesting, smart book, that really shows the gigantic change in perception towards LGBT citizens, who would be fired and jailed if outed just 50 years ago. I would highly recommend it to anyone interest in the journey of LGBT rights in America and the western world in general."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/774519-beth", "userReview": "I found this book fascinating and well-written at first, but then I got lost in the swirling pool of names and dates. The author keeps jumping back and forth in time, which makes following the many threads confusing. That's probably unavoidable considering the large number of gay-rights leaders involved, but I just couldn't wade through this title. It would be good for someone determined to know the entire story, for people looking for detailed information on the gay-rights movement, and for people who already know a fair amount of the story and can keep the people, times and places straight in their minds."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Zimmer", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31751209-jeffrey-zimmer", "userReview": "A good historic overview pre-ObergfellI first came across this book in a bookstore in DC\u2019s Dupont Circle in 2017. Given the state of politics over the preceding year and a half, it seemed like a good time to read about a movement. Victory did a good job of giving an overview of the state of the LGBTQ movement in the 20th-21st centuries.

Hirshman, JD'69AuthorA Supreme Court lawyer and political pundit details the enthralling and groundbreaking story of the gay rights movement, revealing how a dedicated and resourceful minority changed America forever.When the modern struggle for gay rights erupted\u2014most notably at a bar called Stonewall in Greenwich Village\u2014in the summer of 1969, most religious traditions condemned homosexuality; psychiatric experts labeled people who were attracted to others of the same sex \"crazy\"; and forty-nine states outlawed sex between people of the same gender. Four decades later, in June 2011, New York legalized gay marriage\u2014the most populous state in the country to do so thus far. The armed services stopped enforcing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, ending a law that had long discriminated against gay and lesbian members of the military. Successful social movements are always extraordinary, but these advances were something of a miracle.Political columnist Linda Hirshman recounts the long roads that led to these victories, viewing the gay rights movement within the tradition of American freedom as the third great modern social-justice movement, alongside the civil rights movement and the women's rights movement. Drawing on an abundance of published and archival material, and hundreds of in-depth interviews, Hirshman shows, in this astute political analysis, how the fight for gay rights has changed the American landscape for all citizens\u2014blurring rigid gender lines, altering the shared culture, and broadening our definitions of family.From the Communist cross-dresser Harry Hay in 1948 to New York's visionary senator Kirsten Gillibrand in 2010, the story includes dozens of brilliant, idiosyncratic characters. Written in vivid prose, at once emotional and erudite, Victory is an utterly vibrant work of reportage and eyewitness accounts, revealing how, in a matter of decades, while facing every social adversary\u2014church, state, and medical establishment\u2014a focused group of activists forged a classic campaign for cultural change that will serve as a model for all future political movements."}, {"userName": "Bob H", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11254805-bob-h", "userReview": "This book is timely: it wraps up just as the court cases, in California and elsewhere, are heading toward a showdown at the U.S. Supreme Court. Indeed, the author seems to understand the case law up till now -- I would know, having the legal training to appreciate it -- and she explains it in straightforward prose. She understands the historic record as well, and has consulted the past leading LGBT historians: John D'Emilio, Randy Shilts, Alan Berube, George Chauncey.Above all, this is a book of context. The author goes back to the start of the 20th Century and shows how a community, whose very existence was a matter of criminal prosecution once, now is on the brink of some possible victories. She shows how the movement intersected with societal progress in civil rights, feminism, medicine, the Internet and government. (For instance, the author shows how the military gay ban lent itself to sexual harassment, something the Army started realizing after the Aberdeen scandal in the mid-'90's.) She shows how the setbacks -- AIDS, Don't Ask Don't Tell, the rise of a religious right -- themselves caused the movement to grow and adapt.As someone who lived these times and had a minor role in this movement, I can say that this is a timely work. As for the title, Ms. Hirshman herself raises the criticism and says, \"Of course, there's a lot still to be done,\" and that this is no time for a Mission Accomplished moment. Still, the community has come very far, and in a context of greater changes in American society, and inseparable from it."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn", "userReview": "A bit confusing for me who didn't know all the court cases and history of the Gay Rights movement, I learned to tolerate any frustration and read on to get an idea of what was going on. The story of gay rights. begins in the late 1800s when people migrating to cities to work have options to live in rooming houses segregated by sex. While acts of sodomy have always of occurred more people discover they prefer to have sex and live their lives together though they are the same sex. The word homosexual is first created in Germany and small sections of cities create communities. The population is considered sinful by religion and laws in the US are often taken from the church. Most try to keep hidden and live normal lives to keep covered. Prohibition is a time when gays feel protected and can be more open as many laws are disregarded. When Prohibition is repealed States make regulatory laws and gays are more restricted than before. Gay men are forced from jobs during the Cold War as they could be blackmailed by the enemy and are considered UnAmerican. The 60s brings more freedom,the 70s more hate. AIDS strikes and gays must press the government for help. More are spurred to fight for their rights such as Larry Kramer and ACT UP. The story goes right through to the present where gays have endured such outright hate that they force themselves to fight harder and have won many battles. This book tells a good story which I found really valuable."}, {"userName": "Minna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5771176-minna", "userReview": "Boken \u00e4r en bra \u00f6versikt \u00f6ver historien \u00f6ver HBTQ-r\u00f6relsen i USA och dess framg\u00e5ngar och motg\u00e5ngar.

Moves seamlessly from Supreme Court decisions to civil rights movements to community organizations to individual personalities. Already hefty, it is understandable that its scope had to be constrained--nevertheless, it's worth mentioning that it seems mostly (although certainly not entirely) about white men and others in the mainstream media view. It's not about the teenage punk band scene. Transgender people are barely mentioned. It does acknowledge various grassroots support networks, and it gives attention to those who were downtrodden in various ways, whether fired from their jobs, beaten, or afflicted with a virus that medical authorities didn't move fast enough to combat.

Hirshman covers over a century's worth of LGBQT+ history. She is particularly strong at highlighting important court cases. Indeed, I feel like I learned a lot on legal battles alone.

I felt like a new name was introduced pretty much every single paragraph. The political science major in me liked that so much was framed in terms of the theory of a liberal state; the \"victory\" can be attributed to gaining a presence within this theoretical framework.
