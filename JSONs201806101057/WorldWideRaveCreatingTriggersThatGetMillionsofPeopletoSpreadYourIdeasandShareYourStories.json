I even have an Outlook task set so that I can remember to have my once a week look. As such, you won\u2019t be that surprised that I would be a fan of his latest book, World Wide Rave: Creating Triggers that Get Millions of People to Spread Your Ideas and Share Your Stories. For all of us who look to promote ourselves on the web better, and that should be everyone who isn\u2019t driving an ice cream truck \u2013 and some of these guys could use an idea or two \u2013 this book is an excellent starting place. Get your education here!We all need something, some tool to bring our market to us. But more than that, we need to get them speaking about us in a positive manner and passionately spreading the word about our goods and services in a positive way. Your mind is this tool. Not in any esoteric way, but in a very practical and real way. David Meerman Scott shows us how everyone is looking for expertise and the best way to draw people to you is to share that expertise. Each and every one of us have something unique to offer and by offering this freely people (the market) want more and more and will be willing to pay.David Meerman Scott provided many examples in the book of creating World Wide Rave but the one great example that really touched a nerve with me in the book had not so much to do with marketing online but rather a whole marketing philosophy. And it came from what most people would consider an unorthodox place. The \u201cfree giveaway\u201d mentality is the Greatful Dead. First of all, the author and I split when it comes to his love of all things Dead \u2013 I have never really been that much of a fan but I have loads of friends who are among the faithful. David tells how the Dead have one of the greatest marketing systems going by simply allowing their fans to make bootleg copies of their numerous shows as well as taking pictures and video taping the experience. The author even listened to the concert he just attended on his drive back home. The Grateful Dead even incorporate this totally into their marketing plan! One can buy personalized photo albums of the experiences. By allowing the fans to make the bootleg copies they, the fans, share the copies and preserve their fond memories of the experience. And they share the experience with other fans and even those who had never been introduced to the band in the past.The author is very passionate about his subject and throughout the book he urges the reader (yes, you!) to get started on creating your own World Wide Rave. One bit of advice that he did add that I thought was very interesting but extremely astute was that the reader should get on Twitter and keep everyone updated on what they are doing in real time. So if you want to know even more about creating your own World Wide Rave, get on Twitter and start following @dmscott. And while you are at it, tell him that @garydale sent ya!"}, {"userName": "Jaime", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1919632-jaime", "userReview": "This book is easily digestible and is great for someone looking for a social media pep talk. I do think, however, that he oversimplifies the issues and takes the 'anyone can and should be doing this' argument too far. I also disagree with his argument that musicians would have been better served by letting Napster and other free file sharing continue. Meerman Scott suggests that such publicity would up their public exposure and therefore let them sell more in collateral merchandise. While I think such a position is patently unfair to content creators, I also think this business proposition is weak. To quote a blog post I read recently, 'Free is the new stupid.'"}, {"userName": "Victor Barger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2144429-victor-barger", "userReview": "If you're at all familiar with social media and the marketing concept, it's unlikely you'll find anything new in World Wide Rave. However, if you're a businessperson who's just getting started, this book might be just the ticket; it's easy to understand and it's filled with interesting, real-life examples.

Most of the examples are of big company strategy, which as an entrepreneur I found a little hard to relate to.

At times I found myself bored with the repetition and oversimplification whereas some chapters had me saying \"YES!!\" with great enthusiasm. I will likely refer back to parts of this book but most of it was heavy handed refresher course for me. If new media is still new to you, World Wide Rave may be of interest. It offers best practices because there is no guarantee for how to make digital content go viral -- on that aspect I definitely agree with the author."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026378-kevin", "userReview": "This book reminded me a lot of Tribes by Seth Godin, but it definitely had a lot more practical ideas. I got it for free when he was giving it away to Kindle owners. I appreciated that because he wrote a lot about creating content then giving it away for free.
