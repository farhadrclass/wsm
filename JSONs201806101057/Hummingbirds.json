This is way different from zombies but I have to check it out.Okay, so now I've read it. It's possible I would have given this book 4 stars if I weren't reading it on the heels of Exit Kingdom by Alden Bell. I could find no commonalities in writing style between the two. Gaylord said as much in a review. He took on the name Alden Bell when he wrote The Reapers... because he knew he was writing for a different audience. Fans of Joshua Gaylord may not be fans of Alden Bell. The author is a teacher at a private girls high school on the Upper East Side. The story takes place in a fictional private girls high school. I really don't know how male teachers manage the girls, who are practicing their flirting and trying to exert power over the males in their life. When I was in high school, an all girls high school, I had a math teacher who was fresh out of college. He asked us to call him Mr. Saff because he had a long unpronounceable name. He was young and cool and probably a little flirty. At least half the girls I knew had a crush on him ( including me) and looked for reasons to talk to him after class. Anyway, he was not invited back at the end of the school year. I don't know if anything happened or if the administration was afraid something might happen.This story involves teachers and students trying to maneuver their way through a difficult place. Two teachers. Leo binhammer has always been the only young hip teacher and the girls are all half in love with him. Along comes new teacher Ted Hughes. Leo can feel the girls transferring their crushed to Hughes do he ups his own flirtatious behavior. No good can come of this. To complicate things further, Leo's wife had a short-lived fling with Hughes while away at a conference two years ago. Leo wants to hate acted, but he also finds himself failing under Ted's spell.Obviously, Gaylord knows teenage girls and has created some very real characters here."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5709804-danielle", "userReview": "Joshua Gaylord is a fantastic writer. There are paragraphs in Hummingbirds that I reread 2 and even 3 times because they were just so well written as to warrant it. For the use of the word \"palimpsest\", which is one of my favorites and criminally underutilized, 10 points are awarded in my book. However, just as man does not live on bread alone, the author does not work with words alone, he must also be a storyteller. This, in my opinion is where Gaylord is less strong.[return][return]I have to admit that through much of Hummingbirds I found myself longing for it to be over. Gaylord seemed unable, even with all his fantastic words, to develop emotions fully. I thought that this might be because so many of his characters are conflicted, trapped in developmental and relational limbo, but even when the scene evolves to true climax, such as Binhammer throwing out Sybil, the emotions seem muted. Even when the characters are angry or hurting, it is through some narrative scrim.[return][return]I feel like I have to get my dislike for the manner in which Mrs. Mayhew is dispatched off my chest as well. I know it is not particularly central to the plot, but I reached that particular point in the story and had to go back and check what had just happened. One paragraph she is reading desk graffiti and the next she is gone, with seemingly no lead up.[return][return]The book did wrap up into a somewhat appeasing story. Ted Hughes is dealt with in a way befitting of the ridiculous and large character he is by that point. Dixie and Liz learn they are not really so different. Liz, who was disappointingly unrelatable to me considering I was an overly self-aware, judgmental, withdrawn teenage girl, gets her fulfillment and her disappointment. And Binhammer seems just as far from reaching real, solid happiness as he always was, but also just as far from misery. The problem, to me, was that while the ending is acceptable I doubt I would have gotten there had this not been part of a personal reading challenge. I would have succumbed to the screaming desire to return Carmine-Casey high school to the library shelf whence it came."}, {"userName": "Maren", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79063-maren", "userReview": "As a former all-girls school student at a New York City prep school, I was probably more engaged by this book and for longer than I would have been if I weren't compelled naturally by the subject matter. It was an interesting exploration of the awkward tension between the often-rare male teachers and the adolescent girls at schools like this but the writer seems to suffer from a poor balance between \"showing\" and \"telling\" - too often, he manhandles his characters into forced revelations and moments heavy with meaning that could have been gently inferred rather than tacked on at the end of every single chapter within the final 4-5 sentences like clockwork. Also, the rampant references to fragile masculinity and fearsome femininity were both tiring and trite. While I \"liked\" the characters (in quotation marks because likable characters doesn't for me gauge the success of a book), I didn't really care what happened to them because they were fairly obvious set pieces to the greater themes the novel was exploring and those themes were so heavy handed that it was hard to ignore the flat though pleasant nature of the characters supporting them. Also, there are some weird cameos by characters who ultimately don't matter enough to be there yet are. And one or two chapters are told from the point of view of the wife of the main male protagonist but seemingly for no reason, especially since the rest of the chapters are almost entirely told from the point of view of one of the two school girls or the male protagonist. The sole female teacher of note also gets one or two chapters' worth of POV and it was just as stark a jump every time it happened. While the nature of her pathetic-ness and pathos certainly rivals that of her male compatriots, it's handled so much less deftly than theirs is making her more pathetic and less noble, despite the fact that the male characters are far more obviously despicable and the female ones just....pathetic. So, yeah, mostly pathetic people loftily aiming for ambitious, Joycean epiphanies but the pawprints of the writer are all over the narrative so few surprises here and not enough ease in the writing or narrative to make it a wholly worthwhile read. Promising start but unsatisfying."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126777-tara", "userReview": "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Overly crafted, pretentious, writerly writing. I suppose I'm not \"Liz Warren\" enough to get it. Honestly, from the character names to the neurotic main character...what was there to like? Everything in this book took forever and yet...nothing happened. Some characters seemed to be forgotten by the end. I couldn't care about anyone, even when I wanted to. I can just see this book forced upon an English class somewhere, as the only people I think would like it are sadistic English teachers who will love the tendrilly organic writing which lumbers along like some mechanical bovine in the hallways of girlflesh."}, {"userName": "snowplum", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29859477-snowplum", "userReview": "I think JG is a better writer than this is a book, and I would recommend it to someone who can enjoy a book for its prose even if they aren't really enthusiastic about the characters or plot. I do think it works well as a character study of a man who is dealing with growing up (as an adult), identity and jealousy -- but the circumstances are a bit contrived and it's never a total delight to read a book with no character you can just outright love. Not a strong recommendation, but I'd borrow it or buy it at a sale price and give it a try if you can sympathize with a rather neurotic and intelligent 30-something main character and if you generally care more about prose than plot."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14221919-elena", "userReview": "1.) Horribly poetic. Too many metaphors.2.) Each chapter started without any indication as to who was speaking, thinking, observing, etc.3.) As a teacher, I was very uncomfortable with the parts of the book that implied teachers are attracted to their students. 4.) Constantly predictable. You know exactly what's going to happen way before it happens. Makes for a very boring read."}, {"userName": "Dani", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5466026-dani", "userReview": "It took me a long time to finish this book. That's pretty normal for me, since I am a student and generally have a lot of reading on my plate to do that isn't just for fun. However, I had to actually goad myself to keep reading this book instead of reading another because I just didn't see the point in it. Sure, there was conflict, but I wasn't sure where the book was trying to go with it.I also had a problem with some of the character development. Although the book tried to get me to sympathize with Binhammer's wife, I couldn't. There was not enough reason for me to enjoy her as a person to either feel sorry for her or understand her point of view. I also had a hard time understanding why other characters were placed in the book. Sibyl, for instance, was one character that just completely disappeared about 2/3 through the book, and nothing more was said about her interactions with the other characters after that.The students seemed to be placed there (with the sole exception of Liz Warren, perhaps) to be used for plots involving the adults or teachers. I wouldn't normally mind this--not every character has to be essential to the plot--but I don't know why the author actually put some of them there. I understood the character personalities or types, but wasn't sure why they actually mattered or were important.My last criticism comes from the fact that the emotions and behaviors in the book seemed very shallow. Teenage girls are grittier, more emotionally charged, and deep than the book tries to depict. The only mean thing that I ever heard come out of a student's mouth in this book sounded like something I might have said as a teenager while gossiping to another friend, not in an angry confrontation with someone I disliked or was jealous of. Overall, the students seemed way more innocent than they should be in real life, and seemed to pay way too much importance to their teachers."}, {"userName": "Emily Crow", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23080450-emily-crow", "userReview": "I didn't care for Hummingbirds. It's a novel about teachers and students at an exclusive all girls prep school in New York City, and about the gossip, jealousy and speculation that runs rampant after a new male teacher joins the faculty. Once again, I have to concede that the book wasn't bad, per se, although I found it rather tedious.My internal conversations tended to go like this:Would I rather watch Desperate Housewives on Netflix or read more of Hummingbirds? (Housewives won.)Would I rather watch a house sparrow eat a potato chip or keep reading Hummingbirds? (The house sparrow won.)Would I rather go to bed early or read another few chapters of Hummingbirds? (My bed won.)And so on.... So why did I finish it? Well, the book wasn't terrible. And it wasn't all that long. But the characters were insipid and unconvincing, nothing much ever happened, and the writing style was so distant and \"clever\" that I could picture the author congratulating himself on his wit while he wrote it. (Whether he actually did or not, mind you). Final criticism: the POV ping-ponged randomly from character to character on each page, which drove me crazy after a while.On the other hand: Would I rather clean my toilet or read more of Hummingbirds?

It is very contemporary. Even though there is a lot of poetic scandal (?) in the book you are never quite on anyones side and that is what I liked most about the book. You didn't hate anyone nor did you feel bad for anyone. Things just happened and I never really felt against anyone and I thought that was kinda nice. It's nice to read a book for pleasure and feel for everyone as a whole but not hate them or love them. It kinda felt like everyone is your friend and you are hearing all sides of the stories.I liked it and I recommend it to people who enjoy a nice read. There is nothing too complicated about this book and no one drives you mad but there is this beauty in the way Joshua writes and you will not know it until you indulge yourself in it!"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4155350-julie", "userReview": "The writing captured teenage girls in an evocative, Nabokovian (Is that a word?

I thought the climatic scene where everyone's identity was revealed didn't make sense. Why were the two infidels (I know, it's not the right word, but it should be . . .) made at the man they had betrayed? It seemed odd that after all that time, they would immediately form an alliance against the husband. And more importantly the he would immediately feel he had wronged them.

Huh. The word that comes to mind is \"labored\". It had an interesting story, but every page had about fifty metaphors and similes and every detail felt so conspicuously placed so that the reader could pick it out and savor the meaninglessness or something. As if it wasn't enough that the book is by an English teacher and about an English teacher, the main character thinks of his life as if he were a character in a book. Gag. I guess I have a short attention span for \"literary\" writing. Too much time spent reading to-the-point easily-digestible magazine articles.Dixie is a high school senior and she wears pigtails and most of the time has a lollipop in her mouth? Are you kidding me? I identified more with Liz Warren (until the end). The entire school seems to consist only of the English department, which is okay for the teachers but when it is following the girls, they should have some concern about other classes. (And isn't the English department huge for a school of 400 kids?) Also, I don't remember gossiping that much about the personal lives of my teachers when I was at school. And just for the record, in all our high school productions, the on-stage couples would always hug instead of kiss. Paid actors are one thing, high school kids actually kissing a scene partner (and taking direction in doing so) seems like going too far. Binhammer sounds like a terrible teacher - he dismisses them fifteen minutes early, and by the end of the book he's cutting class? Wouldn't they fire a teacher for not showing up to class? And I really don't get why Binhammer keeping Sarah from meeting Ted was an offense anywhere near what they did.One thing I will say for this book, though, is that it does a good job of alluding to things, making the reader guess - is that his wife? Why is he upset? What's going to go wrong at the Christmas party? I feel like I should go back and study how he does it (because it's so transparent) in case I ever want to write a book. And there is not a whole lot of detail about the sex scenes or the fight or the death, which is much nicer than actually having to read about those things."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643578-jess", "userReview": "I've been reading a lot of books this summer. And since I love writing reviews on Goodreads, I've been looking for ways to make my reviews more comprehensive. So I've started carrying my little yellow and black Charlie Brown spiral notebook and a pencil with me wherever I'm reading my current book and jotting down ideas, likes and dislikes, themes, and quotes to put in my reviews. It has been very useful, and I planned to continue with my writing while I read Hummingbirds. But unfortunately, I did not write one word in my notebook. The page with the underlined Hummingbirds heading remains blank. I've discovered it is hard to write commentary on a novel when you can't even put it down.Gaylord's only other novel is \"The Reapers are the Angels,\" written under the name Alden Bell and encompassing quite a different tone and theme. Hummingbirds is not a post-apocalyptic revenge story but rather a tale of the line between adulthood and girlhood in an all-girls private school in New York City. Mr. Leo Binhammer is the sole male English teacher at an all-woman institution and he revels in this environment, basking in the attention he receives from students and teachers alike. But when the aptly named Mr. Ted Hughes comes to Carmine-Casey and starts taking the girls' attention, Binhammers feels his firm grasp on his lady-centric life is starting to slip, especially when the intelligent, charismatic Ted Hughes ends up being the man Binhammer's wife Sarah had a short affair with. Meanwhile, two bright, polar-opposite students--Dixie Doyle and Liz Warren--navigate their last year of high school, work out their admiration and devotion to the two male teachers, and learn a lot about themselves and each other.I loved Gaylord's characterization of everyone in this novel--I truly loved all of it. There is not one character who did not provoke sympathy, empathy, or insight and by reading this novel you can tell Gaylord has such an intense relationship with his characters. He knows them so well and he wants us to know and love them too. In another novel by a different writer, Binhammer could have been this really gross, jaded, cynical man who craves the attention of women and has all these rivalries with men because he is looking for fulfillment in life, but this novel is so far from cynical and jaded. There is just so much life in every character, so much potential, and even as Binhammer feels jealousy and betrayal and anger, we never get the feeling that his life is taking a downward turn. My favorite chapter was the one where Binhammer and Ted Hughes, taking a short trip to another school on assignment, meet a young woman named Dora who they befriend and walk around town with before letting her crash at their hotel with them. I've never read a book scene like this before--there is usually so much heavy, palpable male-female tension, the smell of rivalry or alpha-male emotions, the hint of after-school special \"two men one girl DANGER DANGER\" alarm bells, but this scene was so damn unique and well-written and we learn so much about these two men in this short scene. Binhammer could just be an every-man Decent Guy who gets shit on by life and Ted Hughes could just be this slightly-odd Manic Pixie Dream Guy, but we never feel like that, even with the thick homoerotic tension between them that makes us believe a Fuck or Fight scene is coming up. They are two guys cut from the same cloth, navigating the same world, and by the end of the novel, we realize it was a race the whole time, and the book ends with no real winner.It took me until the end to realize this, but what Gaylord has done is written two real characters, not archetypes. It also made me realize how many books nowadays rely on two-dimensional characterizations that leave me cold.And I haven't even started on the girls yet. I applaud Gaylord for the way he writes teenage girls, because a long line of poorly-written YA novels show that oftentimes not even young female authors are able to write believable young women. Dixie and Liz are so realistic as 18-year-old girls that it makes me smile to even think of them--confident and self-conscious in alternating bursts, flitting in and out of fads ranging from speaking French to renting foreign films, having hobbies and talents and goals outside of men and boys, having personality, having agency, feeling sure of who they are as people even when they aren't sure what their futures will hold. Young girls making choices for themselves. Teenage girls are pretty much the #1 target audience for consumerism in America, yet they are shit on constantly. But this novel doesn't abide by that. Teenage girls are deep, multi-dimensional characters, just as real and interesting as Binhammer and Ted Hughes. I kept expecting to feel a slimy, Lolita-like victimization of the two girls by the men, but that was so far from happening, because Gaylord realizes that teenage girls are not innocent little kittens who are unaware of the world around them. They may be even more cynical then their older counterparts, something I loved about this book.This book left me pensive, satisfied, smiling, and very surprised. I have a feeling Hummingbirds is my summer Dark Horse read, similar to last summer's The Good People of New York. I wasn't even expecting a walk in the park and I got a damn parade. Also, if possible, invest in the Harper Perennial P.S. copy of this novel, because there are some great little extras in the back--interviews with Gaylord, a novel soundtrack, and a recommended reading list."}, {"userName": "Colleen Rockafellow", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63863529-colleen-rockafellow", "userReview": "Very descriptive with most of the book taking place in the minds of the characters.

Adored and admired, Leo finds great contentment and solace in his profession as the only male teacher in the English department, doting girls following his every move. But Leo's world is disrupted when, one day, a charismatic new teacher named Ted Hughes arrives. This teacher is also a young and attractive man, and although he is friendly and amiable, Leo begins to feel displaced from his high perch at the school when the girls begin to notice and appreciate the attractive newcomer. As Leo learns to adjust to his new circumstances, life continues on at school and complexities and rivalries crop up in not only the students' lives, but in the teachers' as well. Leo and Ted become unlikely friends and Leo begins to unwittingly uncover all the many secrets and intrigues that Ted has kept hidden. Wryly amusing and stylistically deft, Hummingbirds is a cautionary and provocative tale about the overly fragile egos of two very educated men.I really enjoyed this book, and for the most part, I would have to say that it was extremely well crafted. I was impressed with the author's writing style. It was very fluid and engaging, and in addition, most of the writing was very witty and humorous. The author seemed really adept at creating humorous situations and dialogue that really made the story sparkle and sizzle. Other sections of the book were written a bit like prose: great imagery and succinct word choices that made an impact without being overbearing. The writing struck the perfect balance for me by being neither too sparse nor too wordy, and instead I felt that the author was able to capture the emotions and conundrums of his characters perfectly. The narrative was told through several points of view, but these shifts were handled very solidly and without a lot of confusion, making the multiple narrator strategy very successful.The story actually had three subplots: two involving the teachers, and one involving the students. It was very amusing to see that the teachers and staff had more drama and intrigue going on than the students did and that they handled their dramas with much more immaturity and snark than a group of teenage girls ever could. Though the story that focused on the students was interesting and involving, I thought that the grist behind the teachers' escapades was much more satisfying to me personally. I think on the whole, the story was integrated very well, with neither side dominating the limelight excessively.I also thought that all of the characterizations were done very well and were remarkably detailed, though my favorite was the exasperated Binhammer, who sometimes could be a bit churlish when it came to his waning popularity. The author really had the knack for crating well rounded three dimensional characters, and I thought that he was quite brilliant in his creations of the schoolgirls. He managed to capture all the innocence and seductiveness that was teetering on the edge of their femininity remarkably well, and it was not hard at all to take them seriously as both girls and women due to their expert creation.The only part of the book that I took exception to was the ending. Up until the last section of the book, I was happily reading along and spending most of my mental energy in being impressed by the author's turn of phrase or expert scene creation. I was completely taken by surprise by the turn the book took towards the end, and the main thing that bothered me was not the direction that the action took in the story, but the way the characters reacted to it. I don't want to say too much about the plot twist because I fear I will be giving too much away to those that are going to read the book, but after a certain point, I didn't think that the reactions of the surrounding characters were very realistic, especially in the case of Binhammer. It was almost as if he changed some of the fundamental aspects of his character. After examining it more closely, I also draw the conclusion that perhaps the reader doesn't know the true Binhammer until the ending of the book, and that these revelations about his character had always been there just waiting to be exposed under the right circumstances. Whatever the case may be, I felt that the ending left me a little bewildered, if not taken aback. I don't think that my bewilderment at the conclusion of the book drastically affected my enjoyment of it, and to a certain degree, I think it may have changed or even enriched the complexity of the story, so I can't really say that the ending was a disappointment. Rather I will say that I think it was a little unexpected and made me reshape the terms under which I was reading.There were a lot of wonderful aspects to this story and I think that if you are the type of person to appreciate witty and satirical writing, this is definitely the book for you. The plot and character creation were first rate, as was the smooth writing. This is not only a great book to lose yourself in, it is a book that will make you think and evaluate the power of interpersonal relationships.

It says something about a book when it is so good that you simply cannot help but look up the author and their history. It turned out that Alden Bell had not always been Alden but instead had been Joshua. \" The reapers are the angels\" also wasn't his debut novel, but rather his second one. All of this of course, had me ordering his original book from Amazon faster then my mother can retract her credit card number.What came in the mail a few days later was HUMMINGBIRDS, a novel dynamically different then the one that had started me down its path. No zombies exist in hummingbirds, neither does it have active violence and games of cat and mouse. Rather this book takes us to an even darker world then the one riddled with the dead. We find ourselves in an all girls school in Manhattan, and we watch as these childish intellectual girls stumble upon their own maturity and budding sexuality.Leo Binhammer, the only male teacher in the school's english section dotes on each of the girls in turn and they of course dote on him. He is the Hercules of their small universes, and the only male to breeze in and our of their small \"hummingbird\" lives. They cling to him and need his approval in the way that all girls do when separated from their paternal figures. Binhammer basks in their attentions, as well as the attentions of the female teachers at the school, joyfully acting out his part as lion at the head of the herd.However, this all changes when Ted Hughes enters the school. Hughes is an instant threat to Binhammer's empire, and a threat to Bin hammers home life. Hughes presents Binhammer with the male friend that he never had as well as the masculine energy that the school has never had to face. Now the two teacher battle for the girls attention ( as well as the female faculty) in a rush to preserve their own sense of manhood in a world where everything swirls into female voices, female thoughts, and female emotions.While the teachers battle over their own positions many of the girls are doing the same. Dixie Doyle and Liz Warren, two incredibly different girls struggle to come to terms with the world as it crashes in on them at the end of the senior year. Dixie flaunts her new found sensuality, ripe for the taking even if she does not know how to use it. Liz is the opposite, locking herself within the confines of baggy clothes and poetic words in order to stave off the inescapable sexual awakening that lies at the root of all of her plays. The novel follows these two teachers as well as the two girls as they go through their final transformations, discovering and identifying with parts of themselves that they did not realize was their before. This over all was an incredible piece of literature. In fact it was so good that it has been given the privilege of sitting on my favorite shelf ( very few books are allowed this privilege let me tell you) The knowledge and language that surrounds each character is riveting. I have always been a fan of imagery, ( hence my well known devotion to Cormac McCarthy) and this book presents imagery by the bucket loads. My favorite paragraph in the whole novel is when Binhammer first see's and Hughes.\" He'd felt it in the past- that feeling that his insides where melting into his toes, his bottom half filling up with the liquefied remains of his heart, his stomach, his lungs. \"This is just one of the many beautiful lines that weave this story. All I can say is every bit of this book took my breath away. It deserves to be a New York Seller and if it was up to me I would be singing its praise from every rooftop, of every building across this great nation. I will of course suggest it to everyone I know, pushing it onto their laps and hiding it in their stacks of magazines. I will leave it behind in cars, accidentally drop it in the hallway, and maybe even give it as a gift. I will as always try to force the beauty of it onto others, and be rebuked for the fact that I have once again fallen in love with something that many people do not care a lick about. My dangerous literary obsession has spurred up in time to make me the perfect sales person. I cannot make people read this book but I certainly can say you will not look at relationships or the people around you in the same way after you have finished it. I also promise that this is not a painful book to read, all the lines are beautiful, powerful, moving and completely intoxicating. You will not have to dredge through a single paragraph, but simply allow your mind to go into the characters and let their wisdom and experience fill you.I hope that If you read this book you love it and I hope that you have a wonderful summer and enjoy all the books that are to follow.

Here we find a heated and flurrying mixture of adolescent girls, the men and women who teach them, and the occasional visitors from the local boys school.As in every school, there are stars. The star students here are Dixie Doyle, the lollipop sucking, pigtail wearing popular student with her cadre of followers. There is also Liz Warren, the studious, non-smiling student who always gets 'A's', and is a playwright. There are two male teachers who the young women adore, Mr. Binhammer and Ted Huges (with the unfortunate name of a dead poet). Binhammer has been in the school much longer than Mr. Hughes and they have a competitive relationship for popularity and adoration. As Binhammer says, \"Carmine-Casey, of course, is the right place for him. Women to the left of him, women to the right of him. Like Alfred Lord Tennyson in a sorority house. That is, until the new teacher came along\".Binhammer is married and we find out early in the book that Sara, his wife, has been unfaithful to him at a conference. Incredibly, the young man she has her short-lived affair with is none other than Ted Hughes, the new teacher at Carmine-Casey. Binhammer attended this conference with his wife and shortly after they returned home Sara confessed her infidelity. He recognizes Ted Hughes when he first makes his entrance into Carmine-Casey. However, he chooses to keep his connection with Hughes a secret from Sara. How long can he do this without Sara finding out as their are a lot of events at Carmine-Casey that take place in the evenings where wives are expected to attend?This is a story of women and the men who love and seek to understand them, who watch them flutter and dream, and really, truly LIKE women. \"He likes women. He's not just attracted to them - - he likes them.\" It is also a story of girls becoming women and their travails and kudos as they seek to be admired and taken seriously. This is also a story about the women who teach at Carmine-Casey and their attempts to compete with their male counterparts as they attempt to be noticed and attended to by them. The mingling of the female teachers and male teachers often goes well beyond the confines of Carmine-Casey.Friendship is another important theme of this book. The students and teachers wrangle to be noticed and listened to by those that are important in their lives. Dixie wants Liz to take her seriously, she wants Binhammer to listen to her. Liz wants to be noticed by Hughes. Binhammer wants to be admired by Ted Hughes. \"Ted Hughes, the center of so much feminine attention. Binhammer realizes, embarrassed, that what he wants most is to beat those women and girls at their own game, to be dynamic enough to hold the gaze of Ted Hughes. To be the center of attention of the center of attention. That would be something.\" Friendships are vied for by students and faculty and they are evolving and changing as the seasons. Nothing at Carmine-Casey is static except the architecture.The issue of gender is looked at with true puzzlement, as though it is something that is always just beyond our ability to understand. The girls love boys and men. The men love girls and women. However, loving and understanding are two different things. It is easy to love. Understanding, however, is a river that will flow forever, ephemeral and obtuse.The girls want to be women, the women want to be girlish, the boys want to be men, and the men want to be boys. Carmine-Casey is a sea of wanting to be something else other than what you are. As one girl says, \"You think you're going to get a look at something new. You think that the adult world is going to be like Oz - - once you're through the door everything is suddenly going to be in color. You find someone to take you there, and it's like going to a different country. But when you land on the other side you realize you haven't gone anywhere at all. You're back where you started. There aren't any new colors\".The book is a languishing and lovely read about the people who spend their days in the hallowed halls of Carmine-Casey, and sometimes their evenings as well. It is also about what they do when they leave these hallowed halls. It is about friendship, gender, age, love, sex and wanting - - wanting to be something different, something that is colorful and special, that all will notice and admire. They want to be \"the voice that rings out clearer through the halls than any bell at Carmine-Casey\"."}, {"userName": "Ti", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122928-ti", "userReview": "The Short of It:A perfect mix of wit and self-doubt.The Rest of It:Carmine-Casey is a swank, all-girl prep school in Manhattan. There, girls like Dixie Doyle and Liz Warren walk the hallways, somewhat innocent of the effect they have on others but at the same time, aware that somewhere within them, lies the power to take grown men down.Enter Leo Binhammer. Binhammer, as he is affectionately called, is the only male teacher in the English department and prides himself on the fact that nearly every female he encounters finds him fascinating in some way. His position as stud is challenged when Ted Hughes joins the staff. Ted is also witty with the ladies. So much so, that years ago he had an affair with Binhammer\u2019s wife, Sarah. Although Binhammer keeps this info to himself, the two find themselves jockeying for a favorable position and the result is entertaining and amusing.This is not your typical prep-school fare. The girls are blown-up stereotypes of what we know popular girls to be, but these girls are innocently charming as well as dangerously sexual and bright. Extremely bright. Young and green but on the verge of becoming something else. They possessed a freshness that I found so appealing.The men, although full of testosterone and practically strutting the halls, had a vulnerability to them that I found wildly attractive. I could easily see myself as one of their students hanging on their every word. As I was reading, I recalled my middle school days when I had a huge crush on Mr. Taylor, my history teacher. I gazed at him every chance I could and when I had him again as a professor in college, imagine my surprise! College meant I was older and not jail bait. Get my drift? Of course nothing happened but my point is that Gaylord\u2019s depiction of such a formative period was spot on. The fawning, the exaggerated sighs, the doubt that manifests itself in preening and five layers of lip gloss.The other thing that impressed me is how the author managed to create such flawed, yet likable characters. I don\u2019t recall one character that I disliked in any way. They all had their faults but their vulnerabilities saved them from being vapid, empty creatures. I enjoyed their insecurities far too much but I couldn\u2019t help it, I was sucked into their world every time I opened the book.I also thought quite a bit about the significance of the title. These girls flit and float around these men as hummingbirds do to flowers, but it\u2019s more than that. To me, the fleeting quality of their youth is what stood out. Their inability to remain young forever and the unknown of what was to come is what occupied my thoughts long after I finished the novel.I highly recommend this one. It somehow captures adolescence and adulthood in one fell swoop.For more reviews, visit my blog: Book Chatter."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177641-staci", "userReview": "Why I wanted to read this book: * I was totally intrigued by the dynamics of an all-girls school and seeing it from the male teacher perspective.What worked for me: * Have you ever read a book that you really really liked, but yet you had an incredibly hard time describing it well enough to someone else so that they would be excited about it too?? Yep, this is one of those books. * Call me crazy, but about 50 pages into this book I was vividly reminded of the movie 'The Virgin Suicides.' There is just 'something' about this story involving the intimate relationships of girls and the boys/men that they let into their world which made me draw parallels from that movie to this book. * I liked the two male characters. Each was very different, yet I felt that they had much in common. I don't want to delve too deeply into their relationship because I truly feel that the reader needs to experience it and draw their own conclusions. I think their relationship is my favorite part of the book. * The title is apt and just. I thought the author made great connections between the women/girl's behavior and how a hummingbird behaves. There is also this humming throughout the book of something sinister or bad that will occur. * The crushes on the teachers were spot on. I've experienced a few of them myself, even though I never took one as far as some of the girls in this story, I understood that 'secret thrill' of having the teacher look at you in a way that isn't entirely innocent, but it wasn't perverted either.What you should do before reading this book: * Read the P.S. Insights, Interviews, and More...I sometimes like to read this first because I've found that it helps set the tone of the story for me and sort of puts me in the mindset of the author. I loved Gaylord's essay on \"Being a Student.\" I too loved school and learning and had a few great teachers who made an impact on me. For that I will be forever grateful.  * A Soundtrack for Hummingbirds- Listen to the songs (but don't read the reasons why he picked them, save that until after you finish the book) that Gaylord's selected as a soundtrack to this book. I've never heard of any of them until tonight and I can honestly say that it made the book even more meaningful for me. In fact, I loved the songs so much that I'm going to add them to my iTouch soon. Reading his thoughts on why he picked each song allowed me more insight into the characters that he created.Recommend? I would recommend this one to my friends. It's quirky, weird, but yet excellent. The worst thing that can happen is that my friend doesn't like it as much as I did. But the best outcome is that they really enjoyed it and could actually understand why I had such a hard time putting my thoughts into cohesive sentences!!!My Rating: 4/5"}, {"userName": "Carol ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2948316-carol", "userReview": "Leo Binhammer is one of the few male faculty at an all-girls Prep school in New York. And he's the only one of an 'agreeable' age to the students. That's until Ted Hughes shows up on the scene. He eventually rises in the girls' opinion, not usurping Binhammer, but certainly taking away much of his attention. An interesting relationship grows between the two men, even more abstract due to several points in both their pasts. I don't want to write a synopsis so I won't go any farther. Other people are much more apt at it than I am.In short, I liked what Gaylord gave us. It was an interesting plot, the characters were very real, and the author wrote teenage girls better than I think I could, and I was once a teenage girl myself. His language was gorgeous, and there were points where I had to stop and re-read a sentence a few times, just because I loved his word choice and the way it all flowed. It was wonderful.What I hated was how completely random everything seemed. Nothing was glued down. There really was no established timeline. I kept getting confused... were we three months back now from the \"current\" frame? Or was this the same time but from a different character's perspective? His holidays even seemed to have gotten mixed up, although I forget the exact example. I had difficulty remembering what order events happened, and I don't like losing track of details in books, especially when they are so major in pulling everything together.It actually made me resent the book. I had severe difficulties getting through it near the end, and reading it seemed like a punishment. Usually books that I wish to finish but aren't that 'into' I'll just pluck up another to read on the side. But I couldn't do that! Because so little was concrete in his timeline, reading another book made me forget details and information all together. I'd have to back track several chapters to catch up, as if I'd not read the material at all.I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to read some glorious language, but I don't think I could read it again.

The parallels are obvious: the best thing about \"Hummingbirds\" is its writing, God, the guys is good. Less gruesome here but just as insightful, beautiful and touching. Gaylord has a hand for details in his characters and writes wonderful little scenes of interaction between them and great observations on them. Some scenes in here were so good, sooo gooood.Where I struggled (because I think Gaylord struggled there) was the plot, for a long time the story felt like it was not going anywhere, especially the first half of the novel reads a bit purposeless and therefor limps. I, too, had to get used to the extreme focus on the romantic and flirtatious involvements of the cast. I expected that to be of more importance later in the novel but right from the start it is all about what teachers think of other teachers, what the female students of this all-girl school think of boys and what they think of their few male teachers, what those teachers might think of those students... Yes, some of it might be inappropriate but that doesn't make it less true, we all have those thoughts at times. And when you stick til the end no matter how much you cringed before the situation is so humanized that it is not about being appropriate or not any longer but just about being honest and real. The ending gives a nice wrap-up, the characters clearly moved forward and came to places, I found the ending surprisingly touching even though it is as low-key as the rest of the book yet it is done with grace and love for the characters that lived on these pages.So, I might prefer his Alden Bell persona more but I liked this also. It read very much like a debut novel that needed quite some time to find its momentum and its strengths, I am intrigued for more and hearing great things about \"When we were animals\" which sounds a lot darker than the Hummingbirds and could be more on par with the Reapers."}, {"userName": "Kelly McCloskey-Romero", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1874837-kelly-mccloskey-romero", "userReview": "I'm starting to have a problem in my reading life. Or maybe I've always had it. As I grow to appreciate writing in the hopes of becoming a writer myself one day, I get seduced and bedazzled by sentences. I allow those sentences to draw me into the story, and somewhere in the middle of the book, I realize that I hate the characters and the plot.That's what happened here, and I was even more entranced because this is the story of a teacher! Though the public magnet school where I teach is worlds away from the NYC elite private girls' school where Mr. Binhammer, the protagonist of Hummingbirds, teaches English,I was excited about this context. I did love reading the day to day details of his teaching day, grading papers, trying to hold the students' attention, interactingwith colleagues in the lounge....But the students! Binhammer's disdain for these female students, the Hummingbirds swirling around his head, the flat portraits that he paints of them and their inner lives, really grated on me. The girls, for all the sentences devoted to them (most of them skillfully crafted and a few of them really poignant), occupy no important space in this book. The book is about a competition between the two male English teachers, a lot of it imagined in Binhammer's head, and the women are only consequential in relation to these men and their head trips. That disgusts me, as does the inevitable deflowering of a smart teenage girl and the clumsy shrewishness of all the female teachers.In teaching, we talk about the importance of student-centered classrooms, a turning away from the traditional model of teachers droning on in front of a class. This is a teacher-centered story, with a weak, neurotic, unlikable teacher at the nucleus, with a retro feel that doesn't redeem it."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225906-susan", "userReview": "I'm determined not to fall behind on reviewing again. This was extremely well-written. I questioned the style a little when I first began the novel but quickly grew accustomed to the rhythm of the prose. There are some beautiful metaphors and phrasing used to describe the most mundane and everyday things. The most impressive thing about the novel is the intricate relationships explored. I'm always looking for novels that successfully depict the very complicated push-pull relationship between a teacher and student. Most stories quickly veer into absurd satire or complete implausibility. This novel, however, not only nails the relationship but also tackles the relationships between student-student and teacher-teacher quite well, at least from my personal experience and observation. Satire IS present, especially at the start of the novel, but it's subtle and almost completely disappears by the end. I found Dixie Doyle to be too much of a caricature initially, but when all is said and done, I think she is an excellent foil for Liz Warren. The everyday relationships and characters in the novel were so realistic and familiar to me, that I almost wish that Gaylord hadn't developed the sexual aspect of them as it isn't apparent from the front flap. However, I suppose it was inevitable, and for the most part, it was handled so well, with the affair itself lasting no longer than 2 or 3 pages. Here, it's the build-up and the aftermath that are most important -- and most interesting.

Imagine the pressure of being EdgarAward-winning novelist Megan Abbot\u2019s husband. Yikes! But ya gotta give Gaylord credit for trying and having a good start.In his debut novel, Hummingbirds, Gaylord sets his contemporary story at an exclusive all-girls prep school in New York City. It seems much like the one he has taught at for the past nine years. Write what you know, they say.\tGaylord does take a chance in this work by not writing the story from one of the girl\u2019s---or several girls\u2019---point of view. Instead, the story is about the only male teacher on the English Department Faculty, Leo Binhammer. That is until a new teacher with the unlikely name of Ted Hughes. For those you can\u2019t quite place the name, Ted Hughes was Sylvia Plath\u2019s husband\u2019s name. Interesting.Leo knows one thing that Ted doesn\u2019t know. Leo knows that Ted had a brief affair with his wife, Sarah. Leo is constantly worried about this and manages to keep the two from meeting until the faculty holiday party. Hummingbirds gets off to a fast start, then quickly accelerates. The story maintains its suspense until about the halfway point. Then the story bogs down in lots of repetition and angst.
