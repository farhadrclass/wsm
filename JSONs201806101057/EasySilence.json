This book wasn\u2019t on my radar. It wasn\u2019t even on my TBR list. I read one review that peaked by curiosity and a friend was kind enough to share it with me so I jumped right in. This was such a beautiful and emotional love story. I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t make a connection with the two main characters because I don\u2019t often read stories where they are younger. Samantha was 18 and Jaxson was 20. But the story was wonderfully written and Jaxson and Samantha were wise beyond their years.\n\u201cSometimes people enter our lives, leaving an imprint forever embedded in our hearts.\u201d\nWe all remember our first loves. They are the ones that we never quite forget. Samantha and Jaxson's lives were so different. Their paths normally would have never crossed but sometimes fate has a funny way of bringing two people together.Jaxson Callahan ~  was a lost soul. He was a bitter young man who would resist kindness and happiness at every turn. But deep down he had kindness and love in his heart. Samantha could feel it every time she was with him. She knew that the same beauty she saw on the outside was buried deep on the inside. \nSamantha Carmichael ~  was a sweetie. I loved her strength and her courage. On the outside looking in you would think she had everything anyone could want. But Samantha was missing something or someone. Jaxson didn\u2019t expect her to want him. He didn\u2019t expect to want her.\nSam and Jaxson met one summer day on the beach. It didn\u2019t go all that well but Samantha felt a strong connection with Jaxson. It wasn\u2019t just one thing, it wasn\u2019t just a feeling. She just wanted to be with him. \nLittle by little Samantha chipped away at Jaxson\u2019s defenses and a relationship starts to bloom. Jaxson was slowly turning his tattered heart over to Samantha. He didn\u2019t understand why she wanted to be with him or why she was falling in love with him but he decided to take his little piece of happiness. He was falling in love with her too.\nIt seemed that fate had brought Samantha and Jaxson together and it would be fate that would come knocking once again. Life and love can be so very wonderful and it can be so very difficult. Samantha would find herself making some wishes that would be difficult. This young love will experience happiness and heartache. But true love never fails.\nI am so glad I decided to read this sweet and tender love story. It was a heartbreaking and emotional journey that Samantha and Jaxson go on. My heart broke into a million pieces but Ms. Rinyu put it back together for me in the end. \n \u201cWe were destined to experience the beautiful, bittersweet emotion of a love so perfect a love so strong\u2026.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Carol (StarAngel's Reviews) Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6294320-carol-starangel-s-reviews-allen", "userReview": "Book\u00a0\u2013 Easy SilenceAuthor\u00a0\u2013 Beth RinyuPublication Date\u00a0\u2013July 9, 2015Genre\u00a0\u2013 Romance Type\u00a0\u2013 Stand Alone Cliffhanger\u00a0\u2013 NoRating\u00a0\u2013 5+++ out of 5 StarsComplimentary copy generously provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.My Thoughts - Story I really don\u2019t even know how to put into words what this book did to me.

This was so heart wrenching. This was a story about true love and soulmates. When people look at Sam and Jax, they don't see any similarities. But when you look deep inside them, they are so alike. Both are in difficult family situations, and both have a sweet soul.Sam was kind of off putting for me at first because she was so direct, blunt, and honest. She put out everything on the line for a boy. But it worked. She needed to be that way for Jax to understand love. Jax was an unknown hero. Everyone in town judged him by who his parents were. But he had a heart of gold. He also believed that quality was more important than quantity in life. \n\"He was unlike any other guy I had ever been attracted to, but underneath his tough exterior, I saw a sad little boy, a scared young man, and a lost soul, not knowing which direction to take his heart.\"\nThis is a must read!

As we read the love story that was Sam and Jaxson we stumbled and dragged our feet through the first half, being told to feel \u2013 told to experience rather than actually being in the story ourselves.\u2018It was mature. It was undying, and it was the kind of love that most people don\u2019t ever even get to experience once in their life. How fortunate was I to have gotten to experience it twice.\u2019Then suddenly about 40% from the end it was as if the story truly awakened \u2013 it began to demand our attention, our emotion and our undeniable riveted attention. We felt, we experienced \u2013 we truly and finally became a part of Easy Silence and it hurt. It hurt so much just the way we love it to. The love, the beauty, the pain and the anguish. We felt it all. That is why this review is so incredibly hard to write as until we were two thirds through we struggled a bit with the story, the way it was told and the nature of the heroine. Being spectators that are just okay with what we are being shown to suddenly being invited to participate mind body and soul is two very different types of plays. We are the kind of readers that enjoy the second option and for that the last 40% shone like five brilliant stars as opposed to the blinking on and off three. Now, there is no doubt that Beth Rinyu is a fabulous author who truly writes with emotion; she proved that time and time again.

What we loved is that this Author wrote the story as it played out for her; her warning of this kept us reading and we loved this very fact because it proved to be worth it in every way that counts.\u2018Together we created an easy silence, a silence that most people would find awkwardly eerie, but for us, it was symbolic of our relationship.\u2019**Reviewed from an ARC copy provided by the author with thanks.**\u2665 \u2665 \u2665\u2726\u2726\u2726 TB Blog :TotallybookedBlog\u2726\u2726\u2726 Come say Hi : TB on Facebook\u2726\u2726\u2726Follow us: TB on Twitter\u2726\u2726\u2726Check out: TB on Pinterest\u2726\u2726\u2726 We're on TSU: TB on TSU"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14986446-christine", "userReview": "A gut wrenching heart breaking emotional story about Jaxon and Samantha.Samantha the well to do daughter of a senator and Jaxon the bad boy from a broken loveless family.They came together so young and didn't know it till the end.Jaxon you ripped my heart out when you left and Samantha I loved that you went after your dream.The happiness that Samantha bought to Jaxon was beautiful after all the pain he had suffered.At the end I felt we had gone a full cirle.A beautiful sad story."}, {"userName": "Three Chicks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20696685-three-chicks", "userReview": "5 Star Review by Jen SkewesI am not even sure words can describe how beautiful this book is. I am a huge fan of Beth Rinyu and her writing. I have read every one of her books and I have loved them all. In fact Dailan O\u2019Malley is one of my top book boyfriends. But after reading Easy Silence I have to break the news to Dailan, because Jaxson Michael Callahan completely owned my heart after reading this book. This is by far my favorite book from Beth. It is unlike anything she has ever written and in ways very different from what I have read in the past. It is beautiful and emotional. I knew that it was going to be an emotional journey so I did everything to prepare myself for it. But the truth is that I was in no way prepared for what she had in store for me. It was nowhere near what I expected. And I mean that in a really, really good way. This book more than exceeded any expectations that I had. This is the heartbreaking and beautiful story of how Jaxson and Samantha met one day at the beach in North Carolina. Jax saved her that day but little did they know that they would save each other in so many ways.Samantha is spending her summer with her grandmother who is suffering from Alzheimers. On the beach she meets Jaxson and lets just say they did not get off to a good start. They seemed to hate each other but Samantha wasn\u2019t really sure why. Jaxson seemed to have her all figured out, a rich spoiled brat who wants for nothing. Jaxson on the other hand has had a horrible childhood and is just trying to live life. He is angry and bitter and just mad at the world. But I think Samantha sees more to him than that hard exterior. As time goes on and with Samantha\u2019s persistence, Jaxson slowly begins to open up to Samantha in so many ways. He learns to open up to her about his past, about his fears, but he also manages to open up his heart as well. Sam teaches him what it is like to love and to be loved. And for the first time Jaxson finds himself happy and even manages to smile once in a while. Things seems be going perfect for them until it all comes crashing down. Completely ripping away anything that they had together. And you are left wondering if these two will make it? If their love strong enough to survive?It is so hard to write this review without giving away any spoilers so I am going to do my best to describe my true feelings when it comes to this book. First off, I just loved Jax and Sam. These two touched my heart and their story is one that I will never forget. Beth Rinyu manages to pull out all of the emotions with this one. I hurt for Jaxson and all that he went through. I hurt for him because I saw the man that he is today and knew that deep down there was so much more to him. And I really believe that Sam brought that goodness out in him. He cared so much and while at times my heart hurt for him he also made it happy. Samantha was the perfect heroine. I loved this girl! She had her own issues with her family and she was so far from the person Jaxson thought she was. But I loved that she never gave up on him. She saw the good in him when no one else did. She loved him and taught him so much about that one four letter word. They were just perfect together. What I especially loved about these two is that, yes they were young but they both seemed wise beyond their years but at the same time had this young innocence to them. It was the little things that they experienced together that made just made you happy. They had such an amazing love but it wasn\u2019t one that happened overnight either. Their relationship wasn\u2019t your typical teenage hot and sexy romance. It was real and it was deep. I loved the little moments between them that would make you smile. But their journey wasn\u2019t all unicorns and rainbows. No, not at all. There are heartbreaking moments in this story that will leave you cursing Ms. Rinyu. And trust me I did. She completely gutted me in a way that I wasn\u2019t sure if I would be able to recover. But then she gave me an ending that completely took my breath away. It was beautiful and just perfect and I would not have it any other way. This is one of those stories that will stay with you forever. From the first moment that Jax and Sam met to the very end I was completely captured by them. Their story will stay with me forever. Even just thinking about it gives me goosebumps. This one touched me in so many ways and left me with a hangover for days. Beth Rinyu completely blew me away with this one. This beautiful and emotional journey is definitely one worth taking."}, {"userName": "Gitte TotallyBookedBlog", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7379751-gitte-totallybookedblog", "userReview": "\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f Emotional stars\nIf ever there was a story that split our book hearts in two then this is one of those.

I was left speechless, emotionally spent, but very impressed with Beth Rinyu's unique latest novel.This is a story about an angry, embittered, judgmental young man a who turns into an unlikely savior for a lonely Senator's daughter while she spends the summer at her Grandmother's beach house. What starts out with sarcastic, antagonistic exchanges, gradually turns to tolerance , then a quiet appreciation, understanding and attraction.They are from two different worlds with vastly different outlooks, personalities and backgrounds. But they connect strongly and begin to see under the layers to the person underneath. Jaxson is a loner, somewhat odd, unfiltered, angry and rude. He is the bad boy from an undesirable environment that is drowning in darkness from his past. But as we get to know him more, we can see his vulnerability. He is a lost, confused, and broken boy and no one ever really tried to help put the pieces back together. He has never really felt love or happiness. I loved seeing him slowly open up and seeing deeper into his hidden layers. Sam becomes a calming influence over him. He is still really rough around the edges and struggles with lack of self worth, but she could see his good heart.Samantha is sweet, kind, loving, and devoted to those she cares about. But she has been forced to conform all her life to the standards and expectations of others. She is lonely and feels isolated and ignored in many ways. Jax provides her with a more of a sense of her true self versus society's standards. And he was actually there for here when she needed someone. This is a poignant, heartbreaking yet heartwarming story of true love, healing, and hope. At the same time my heart broke for these characters, I was also enthralled by their intense connection. They were broken and damaged in ways due to no fault of their own, but had to live with the consequences. But their bond was truly pure and powerful. I was impressed by the strength and resilience of both Jax and Sam. I hated to see their struggles, but I loved seeing their growth and changes and the impact they had on each other. The supporting characters all had important roles to play in the story whether it be to provide much needed information, add drama and conflict, or be the antagonists that caused pain. Even the beach setting was almost a character in itself. This book was full of mysteries, secrets, and lies that were very gradually revealed throughout. I love guessing and trying to figure things out before they are fully explained. I loved how the story was not all that it seemed and there were unexpected twists and elements that added to the complexity. It kept me guessing, thinking, and hoping. This left me emotionally drained, but strangely in a good way. It was unique, captivating, moving, intriguing, and full of surprises. It touched me deeply and it brought tears to my eyes both in sadness and in the sheer beauty of it.Sam and Jaxson will not easily be forgotten, nor will their breathtaking, powerful story. The ongoing inclusion of water and the sea mirroring the emotional currents of the characters added depth and more visual imagery to the story. There were important messages about judgment, hope, the healing power of love, personal freedom, and living life to the fullest. I love that Beth Rinyu is not afraid to veer from the typical romance formulas and that she challenges herself to bring us compelling, original stories with surprising twists and emotional impact. I am still in a book hangover over this one.

Holy crap! Was I dreaming too??? Or did I just read that ending?? Now I don\u2019t want to spoil it for anyone, but I\u2019ll just leave you with the thought of \u201cI was so not prepared for that at all\u201d!!! What are the odds of that occurring? It totally gutted me. And, I\u2019ve read over the last two chapters a few times. And, man the tears! Total sobfest for me!! Does it have a \u201chappily ever after\u201d? That depends on what your definition is on \u201chappily ever afters\u201d.\n\u201cMost people want the people they love to live forever, no matter how much pain and suffering they\u2019re in, just because they\u2019re not prepared to let them go. I get it...I mean, you think once this person is gone, then you\u2019ll never see them again. But in reality, isn\u2019t quality of life better than quantity? Let\u2019s face it, we are all gonna die someday. That\u2019s the whole reason we are born, so why prolong it?\u201d\n \u2013 Jaxson (Chap. 6)So the story begins with Samantha spending the summer to visit her grandmother, and as she\u2019s in the water at the beach the tide is bringing her out further and further into the ocean. She thinks \u201cyup\u201d this is her life\u2019s demise when she is lifted out from the water by a mysterious stranger. Jaxson is everything that Sam should stay away from. Dark and silent. But, goregous to look at. Standoffish. Keeping mostly to himself. But, he is hiding a past full of painful memories that has broken him far beyond fixing. He doesn\u2019t want Sam to get a glimpse inside his troubled soul. But, she sees him as so much more than other people. He\u2019s kind and caring. Passionate. Intelligent and speaks his mind. And, he totally gets her too. Their connection is undescribable. Kismet!\n\u201cNo one knows him like I do, Jewel. He\u2019s just as beautiful on the inside as he is on the outside. And, I know it may sound crazy, I have to admit it does even to me, because it\u2019s only been a couple of months...but I really do love him.\u201d\n \u2013 Sam (Chap. 16)But, when old secrets are divulged that involve Sam\u2019s father, Jaxson\u2019s father, Sam, and Jaxson surface, it\u2019s just too hard for Jaxson to face them. So he abandons Sam and all their promises. Wow!!! I couldn\u2019t believe that he would do that to her! I was kind of mad at him for just leaving like that, but I can sort of understand why. He was just hurting so much, and decided that he had to get his s**t together before he brought Sam down anymore into his horrible f**ked-up life.This was just one of those books that I was totally surprised with. There was no way that I would have thought that this book would have been such an emotional ride from the way it started out. Bad boy meets good girl. One changes the other. How does it usually end? With a \u201chappily ever after\u201d \u2013 right? Well, this one did end, but with a HEA? That\u2019s definitely debatable!!Check out Ms. Rinyu\u2019s newest release!

They are complete opposite but had this immediate connection. Sam is the rich senator's daughter that has been handed life on a silver platter. Jax is the \"bad boy\" that has had a life from hell. How could they possibly work, right? Sam escapes the rich life for a summer to spend with her grandma. What she didn't expect was Jax. Everything about this book is amazing! The characters draw you in & you just want to love them! I wanted to jump in the book & hug Jax! \nAs the book goes on, the plot thickens! As the plot thickens, my heart broke a little more! I literally stopped reading at 95% because I THOUGHT I knew what was coming!! Boy was I WRONG!!! My heart is still in shreds but yet it was the PERFECT ending!!! \nI love everything about Beth Rinyu's writing & books. They are all amazing but this one taking the 1st place prize!!"}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17677483-judy", "userReview": "Hidden secrets and lies, some too much to bear. Hearts are broken, tears are shed and lives are forever changed. I can count on Beth to write sweet and ooey gooey stories, and this doesn't disappoint. At times it had a little bit of an 'after school special' feel about it, right before the carpet gets pulled out from under you!Her heroine, Samantha is smart and sweet, yet strong and resilient. She seems like your typical popular girl. Rich, beautiful and has her life all laid out in front of her presented on a silver platter.Her hero, Jaxson is a bad boy.

As a fellow author, I read stories trying to guess how the plot will twist and how the story will flow. So I'm reading, digging the characters. Reading, liking the chemistry. Reading, awwww, this is really good. Then BAM!!!!!! Nothing was as I thought it would go, and that's what made this book AMAZING! It's hard to get me, but dang it, Beth did it in such a brilliant and breathtaking way that I had to message her immediately after reading. We authors tend to be a little insecure (well, a lot insecure) about our writing and how it will be perceived by the reading audience, so Beth asked me if there was anything I'd change in the story. NOT A THING! This story will stay with me for a very long time, and the decisions she made as an author to make it so powerful are superb. An excellent story and easily my favorite book of 2015.

You've written one hell of a story."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16611213-linda", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of Beth Rinyu and love all of her books, but Easy Silence is in a league of it\u2019s own.

I am a huge fan of Beth Rinyu and her writing. I have read every one of her books and I have loved them all. In fact Dailan O\u2019Malley is one of my top book boyfriends. But after reading Easy Silence I have to break the news to Dailan, because Jaxson Michael Callahan completely owned my heart after reading this book. This is by far my favorite book from Beth. It is unlike anything she has ever written and in ways very different from what I have read in the past. It is beautiful and emotional. I knew that it was going to be an emotional journey so I did everything to prepare myself for it. But the truth is that I was in no way prepared for what she had in store for me. It was nowhere near what I expected. And I mean that in a really, really good way. This book more than exceeded any expectations that I had. This is the heartbreaking and beautiful story of how Jaxson and Samantha met one day at the beach in North Carolina. Jax saved her that day but little did they know that they would save each other in so many ways.Samantha is spending her summer with her grandmother who is suffering from Alzheimers. On the beach she meets Jaxson and lets just say they did not get off to a good start. They seemed to hate each other but Samantha wasn\u2019t really sure why. Jaxson seemed to have her all figured out, a rich spoiled brat who wants for nothing. Jaxson on the other hand has had a horrible childhood and is just trying to live life. He is angry and bitter and just mad at the world. But I think Samantha sees more to him than that hard exterior. As time goes on and with Samantha\u2019s persistence, Jaxson slowly begins to open up to Samantha in so many ways. He learns to open up to her about his past, about his fears, but he also manages to open up his heart as well. Sam teaches him what it is like to love and to be loved. And for the first time Jaxson finds himself happy and even manages to smile once in a while. Things seems be going perfect for them until it all comes crashing down. Completely ripping away anything that they had together. And you are left wondering if these two will make it? If their love strong enough to survive?It is so hard to write this review without giving away any spoilers so I am going to do my best to describe my true feelings when it comes to this book. First off, I just loved Jax and Sam. These two touched my heart and their story is one that I will never forget. Beth Rinyu manages to pull out all of the emotions with this one. I hurt for Jaxson and all that he went through. I hurt for him because I saw the man that he is today and knew that deep down there was so much more to him. And I really believe that Sam brought that goodness out in him. He cared so much and while at times my heart hurt for him he also made it happy. Samantha was the perfect heroine. I loved this girl! She had her own issues with her family and she was so far from the person Jaxson thought she was. But I loved that she never gave up on him. She saw the good in him when no one else did. She loved him and taught him so much about that one four letter word. They were just perfect together. What I especially loved about these two is that, yes they were young but they both seemed wise beyond their years but at the same time had this young innocence to them. It was the little things that they experienced together that made just made you happy. They had such an amazing love but it wasn\u2019t one that happened overnight either. Their relationship wasn\u2019t your typical teenage hot and sexy romance. It was real and it was deep. I loved the little moments between them that would make you smile. But their journey wasn\u2019t all unicorns and rainbows. No, not at all. There are heartbreaking moments in this story that will leave you cursing Ms. Rinyu. And trust me I did. She completely gutted me in a way that I wasn\u2019t sure if I would be able to recover. But then she gave me an ending that completely took my breath away. It was beautiful and just perfect and I would not have it any other way. This is one of those stories that will stay with you forever. From the first moment that Jax and Sam met to the very end I was completely captured by them. Their story will stay with me forever. Even just thinking about it gives me goosebumps. This one touched me in so many ways and left me with a hangover for days. Beth Rinyu completely blew me away with this one. This beautifully breath taking journey is definitely one worth taking."}, {"userName": "Alicia Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32341877-alicia-taylor", "userReview": "Last weekend Natalie told me about Easy Silence. She'd just finished reading it and was raving about it. She happened to mention something big happening that broke her. Now I am not one of those readers who enjoy these types of books (A little cryptic there but if/when you read this book you'll understand my meaning in that comment.) so I was really hesitant. Natalie pleaded. I gave it a go. Best. Decision. Ever.I read this book last weekend and I'm still in a massive book hangover - HUGE hangover - and I still can't find the words to express the impact this book had on me. I have never, ever, cried so hard from a book. The last 30% probably took me three hours to finish. Each page took half an hour. I just couldn't see.Literally. Couldn't. Read!Total ugly sobbing.Snot and all LOL.The synopsis tells you everything I'm willing to share with you about the story so I'm going to make this review about my thoughts only. So, for the first 70% of the book I'm enjoying it, but it's a book I've read a million times over. Nothing to make it stand apart. It's beautifully written and you can really connect with the characters, but for me, I needed more. Just something extra. Jaxson Callahan was a man of few words, and when he spoke, I really listened. (Read - but you know what I mean, you lose yourself in the story and all of a sudden you are in that book. It's you LIVING it. Bleeding it.) This is why the first part lacked. Jax would bleed his pain and it would just be swept aside. Like there was no reaction to it. There was, but not enough. I needed deeper. I needed more.Beth Rinyu sure delivered after that.That last 30%... BANG. WHAM. BOOM... I'm done for. Absolutely wrecked. Seriously, Beth Rinyu has just destroyed me. She took my emotions under her control and obliterated me. I felt every ounce of her characters pain, bled right along with them. I sobbed as she bled their pain into words. I was gutted from the brain outwards, my insides stripped bare, my heart torn to pieces, my pulse hammering. Beth took me on the highest emotional roller coaster I have ever been on.But strangely Beth left me utterly content with the ending.It was perfect.I was rebuilt.There are a few lines I absolutely LOVE, but I'm not sharing them. Some would give away too much... and, well, I'm urging you to read the book to find your own favourite lines. You won't be disappointed. I really feel like you're missing out if you don't experience this ending. Easy Silence is a book that shows the true understanding of ever lasting love. It stole my breath. Honestly, it really did - I used my inhalers more whilst reading it than I had for the whole month before. Okay, now I want to explain my rating. The first 70% would have been a 4 star read had the ending not blew me away. The last 30% was 6 stars. I've only ever given 3 books 6 stars. They're the books that emotionally attack my soul. They stay with me forever. They're books I get tearful over just thinking about. The last 30% was that and more. I can't get it out my head. Beth knows how to hit hard. She wrecked my soul and made me happy with the hurt and pain.So overall I give this book 5 emotionally destroying stars."}, {"userName": "Julie Reveles (ILST BLOG)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13455832-julie-reveles-ilst-blog", "userReview": "*** I Love Story Time was gifted and ARC in exchange of an honest review ***5 Amazing Stars! \n\"Together we created an easy silence, a silence that most people would find awkwardly eerie, but for us, it was symbolic of our relationship.\" \nWOW!

Beth Rinyu, will have you on the edge of your seat dying with what is to come next. If you are anything like me, you may even be ready to yell at her once you finish reading this amazing book. Easy Silence is full of romance, drama, friendship, secrets, and heart break. \tMeet Samantha Carmichael, or Sam as she prefers, 18 years old, spending the summer with her sick grandmother on the Beach in North Carolina. Sam comes from a political family who has their heads stuck where the sun doesn\u2019t shine. She is not like the rest of her family though. She is modest, kind, and of course beautiful. She doesn\u2019t need the material or brand name items to be happy.\tHere comes Jaxson Callahan, just Jax if you don\u2019t want your head chewed up and spit out. He is your typical 20 year old bad boy, on edge because of a rough start in life. It\u2019s him against the world. He despises everything he thinks Sam is, only to find out he was dead wrong about her. He doesn\u2019t realize that in a short time, Sam will become everything to him. \tThe two meet after an accident on the beach and soon become inseparable. Although, complete opposites, the two of them seems to be happier together than they have their entire life. They share passionate times together and end up falling in love. But love doesn\u2019t always need happily ever after. Right before summer ends, Sam uncovers a secret that rocks both of their worlds. \tThis riveting story had me wanting to cuss Beth Rinyu out, but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about Easy Silence. Beth didn\u2019t try and make everyone happy with this one. She stuck with what had to be done. There is no Happily Ever After, there is no girl gets the guy or vice versa, there is no riding off into the sunset. This book ends raw and emotional. You will cry, you will scream NOO, and you will be upset.

Not at all!! Oh God what an ending. What should have taken me half hour to read took me double the time because I just couldn't see past the tears. This is an ugly cry book. It literally just tears you apart but the love that Jaxon and Samantha has was so beautiful that I suppose you could say it was bittersweet. This has easily just gotten into my favourites list. I'm not even sure I have words to describe this book, it was just...beautiful, heartbreaking and just so good. I enjoyed this from the very beginning. Samantha has a heart of gold and there was no way you could not love her. She also had a bit if a first side and would pull Jaxon up on his rudeness which I liked. Jaxon was a angry broken guy when we meet him but after meeting Samantha you can see the little changes in him that make him happier even if he doesn't always shoe it in the best way. To think this really only takes place over the course of three months is kind of crazy. It never felt rushed though and I feel like I could read about them for ever. Their love was so strong and went so deep and as the story progresses you really see how far that goes. There are twists in this that I never saw coming and that made it all the better. Not sure how I'm going to get over the last 20% of the book mind. From there I had tears streaming down my face constantly buy the last 10% just the me for six.
