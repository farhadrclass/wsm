They made a contest of it for their own curiosity and amusement and to boost morale in the beyond. It was a hit on the planet: Piles of flowers obscured the names on every cemetery grave and highway shrines glowed elaborate with electric light. A wealthy man held a parade for his mother, which spanned eight city blocks and included great rolling floats representing her spinach casserole and childhood home. On a flat expanse of farmland, a woman used sweaters and slacks to spell out ALAN in the event the gods passed overhead in a helicopter, as they sometimes did. Three girls scrubbed the grime from the corners of their friend's locker and decorated it with streamers. Somebody's grandfather placed a single rose on the pillow beside him and wept until he died, thoroughly missing the point. A child's preserved room was filled with candy until the windows broke, spilling wrapped butterscotch and strawberry suckers into the street. Weeks later, on the third floor of an apartment building, a woman opened her door and saw that her little black cat had found his way home.ADDENDUMin an eerie/sad bitchslap by the universe (perhaps getting back at me for all the unkept promises and such), i posted this placeholder review, with my favorite story-declaration, just a couple of days before my maggie-cat died, and now i feel this story in a much more personal and gutting way. thanks, universe. you dick.******************************************the SECOND book in my third quarterly literary fiction box from pagehabit,and my third amelia gray book overall. how will it hold up to Threats or Museum of the Weird?? i will tell you soon!sidenote/confession:i\u2019ve actually had this book in my house for years - greg read it and lent me his copy, telling me to read The Swan as Metaphor for Love, because i would really like it, and i meant to - i meant to so many times, but i just never did because i am terrible, and then this box forced me into fulfilling at least ONE of my intentions, and i was able to give greg his copy back and a corner of the universe was set right."}, {"userName": "Kevin Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey", "userReview": "Posted at Heradas Review\"Here, the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom, and that road is paved with handjobs.\"I've found that these FSG Originals are at the very least, always something unique that you might not find published elsewhere. They have the feel of something published by a much smaller press like Tin House, Two Dollar Radio, or Coffee House Press. This means that they're usually going to be divisive as well. But, when their niche lines up with yours, it's like a curator personally picking books for you. With the exception of Ted Chiang, story collections are always going to be a little hit and miss from story to story. At worst Amelia Gray's stories are uncomfortable and unsettling, with great prose. At best they're uncomfortable, unsettling, hilarious, disturbing, and moving, with great prose. Great prose is the common denominator.There are 4-5 really great stories in here, and 1 fantastic one. There are about 30 or so that relied way too much on their gimmick to accomplish anything worthwhile as stories. Think Chuck Palahniuk trying to gross you out, and forgetting to you know, tell a story. But if you're like me, you've already been desensitized to that sort of thing, and you're un-gross-outable. So you're just left with no story.'Go For It and Raise Hell' is a high point and you should go read it right now. It reads like a character introduction from The New and Improved Romie Futch, which had fantastic secondary characters. You should go read that book right away. I was also really surprised by '50 Ways to Eat Your Lover.' The way it hid the story in the least interesting part of each sentence was brilliant and really snuck up on me. It accomplished so much in 50 sentences. 'The Swan as Metaphor for Love,' was another one that really worked for me. It illustrated how from afar something can be much more appealing than the up-close reality.The stories that are good, are really good. Gray does this thing with her writing, where there's just a hint of something else going on in each story and the reader has to sort of weed it out for themselves a bit; they have to meet the story halfway. When it works, it really works.All-in-all this is an uneven collection, but the gems are hidden in here, and the stories are short enough that you can slam one out in a couple minutes flat. I'd say go for it. The good stories are worth digging through the rest."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "This book has the most beautiful cover I have seen in many a year.But what\u2019s inside? Contextless fragments of violent American lives, one after another, 37 of them, tiny bits and pieces. You can stumble over some great paragraphs here & there, like this one when a woman tells her boyfriend she\u2019s pregnant and that her parents will be very happy:\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, though,\u201d he said. \u201cYour folks are dead.

But eventually the bittiness of this collection, the constant stop-start reboot (way more than other short story books) plus the gruelling lack of warmth (oh well, another body hits the deck) meant that Gutshot wore out its welcome. Nil desperandum, though - I will be looking out for Amelia Gray\u2019s first novel which it says here she\u2019s working on.

A bullet in the gut.I've seen enough old Westerns to know that in earlier eras a gutshot was the harbinger of a grim, 2-3 day demise caked in blood and shit, a nugget of lead having tumbled through one's viscera, ripping, tearing, perforating but missing the organs that offer a mercifully quick death. Even today it's no trivial matter, and likely to leave it's recipient needing long-term serious medical care.Considering that, this book is well named - Amelia Gray's Gutshot is by turns icky, gross, strange and aware of the muck of life.It's a mixed bag though. Three stories into Gutshot I was ready to bail out. Six stories in I realised that what I was reading was actually pretty interesting.Gutshot is unlike any short story collection I have read. Individually, many of the stories didn't really fly for me, but as a whole this collection is interesting. While I was reading the thread of themes running through these stories- bodies, blood, mucous, etc.- a focus on the grim realities of the corporeal self - began to get into my head. As a whole their tone and mood is quite effectingTo me, this collection reads less like a series of short stories, and more like a strange novel of many disjointed parts, and considering it in that light it is a work of some craftsmanship.However... However. While I liked the tone, and the overall vibe of Gutshot as I said I didn't really like many of the stories. There were a few I enjoyed, and two that stuck in my memory (one where a woman ends up living in the air ducts of a couple's home, the other a very funny takedown of swans - yes, the bird.) but the others largely floated past me like so many grimy soap bubbles, none really sticking in my mind.Overall I rarely experienced the delicious pause that I crave from short stories - the one where you stop reading, put the book down and muse on the wonder/fun/intricacy/fucked-up-ness of the story you've just read. Many of the stories in Gutshot just seemed pointless, and I was glad to finish them, even when they rarely went past five pages in length.In the end, an interesting tone and a couple of strong stories aren't quite enough for me, and while I liked the feel of this collection in the end it left me a little cold. The greatest of those old Westerns with their six-guns and stomach-wound-deathbeds combined a grim, frontier tone with a compelling story, drawing viewers in and filling them with anticipation for showdowns, betrayals and sunset-rides. Gutshot gets it's tone right, but doesn't deliver on the storytelling front for me.2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "One of my presents from AWP! I should have finished this a week ago, but I heard about the leak of the first four episodes of the new Game of Thrones season, and spent several of my reading hours meditating on that terrible tragedy, not reading this awesome story collection, planning my month-long G.O.T. hunger-strike, wishing I hadn't done that to myself...I don't really have a review in me this morning, but I did feel compelled to jump on here and advise you against unquestioningly believing analyses claiming that this whole book is just rape and murder, all hinged on shock-value over artistic merit, and passing on it due to said claims. It is a bit darker than her other stuff, but it's not like she was ever writing Precious Moments copy to begin with. One of the first stories I ever read by her was about a foodie couple chopping off their (well, her) toes for stew. I mean, c'mon. Anyway, she has always managed to be playful in the all-consuming muck of oft-shitty existence, and I find a comforting balance in that, a hopeful practicality which I haven't had sufficient coffee to describe at this juncture. But so yeah, it's Amelia Gray. Recommended for those of you who love Amelia Gray, and also for those of you who like Amelia Gray. And since quite a few of these stories appear to be the product of heartbreak, you hurty-hearts should maybe read it, too.Oh, and I also wanted to tell anyone interested that the back cover claims she is currently working on another novel, which is exciting for those of you who loved the other one as much as I.

They begin to chop it up into little pieces so they can move it out. The youngest child who knew the mom least just wants to participate so he can feel as part of the group. The oldest child is more invested but still able to break away for sleep. The husband struggles most with prying himself away.My mind once was diseased with the strange and heady ambition that I might somehow improve the world by living in it. The reality of the world ruined this ideal; or rather, the fantasy of the ideal ruined the reality.In one story, a couple squatting in an abandoned wing of a factory pays a prostitute to live in their air ducts. Some time later, after the fear subsides, the prostitute accepts her new home. In another story, townspeople make due with a giant poisonous snake that has crashed into their buildings and decided to live in the middle of their city.

They lived on a pond directly between the town and the dorms so that late at night, staggering home, one would be confronted with their yellow, spectrish figures, looming out of the darkness, lifting their wings and hissing and galumphing at one. They were murderous beasts, Swans of the Baskervilles, and I wished they would respect their namesakes enough to die.Many fools think swans are pretty, so I've lived a lonely life. Imagine my relief when I encountered Amelia Gray's story \"The Swan as Metaphor for Love,\" which says everything I've waited to hear another human say. \"Anyone who claims that a swan is a majestic and noble creature has never seen a swan up close,\" Gray confirms. It's probably exactly like the first time a gay teenager reads James Baldwin. Misunderstood, I have been. Cast out. Excluded. Me and Amelia Gray - (pointing two fingers towards my eyes, two fingers towards hers, repeating for emphasis) - we understand each other.Amelia Gray is brilliant and very weird. As my friend Poingu points out, one never has any idea how one of her sentences is going to end. One learns to predict sentences; one has read many of them.

I'm happy to be reading something so new and unexpected. I literally don't know how any of her sentences is going to end--her choices are unpredictable, disturbing, magnificent. These are unsafe stories, at times so absurdly violent that I'm never sure if I should laugh. But they do make me laugh.Here is a passage from the middle of my favorite story in the collection, \"Labyrinth:\"--Knowing what he put into it, I thought it was a shame to stand by and see everyone go. The sun was still low in the sky and it was lonely at home, where the TV had been broken for a week and the tap water had begun to taste oddly of blood. \"I'll go first,\" I said. \"I'll do it.\"--This paragraph has a lot of dramatic tension. Clearly a decision has been made by the narrator. Clearly something is about to happen because of that decision. But what, exactly, is going on? What is this about water tasting like blood? Why is it lonely at home? Why is the TV broken? What does it all mean? You never really know. If you were to read from the beginning of the story you would still not know. You arrive at this passage in the middle of a story, and what has come before has already left you, sentence by sentence, with more questions than answers, and even so you feel completely in thrall of the storytelling, of where it will lead. In each of her stories, Gray drives forward relentlessly to a satisfying conclusion, but along the way she keeps adding tantalizing, striking, unexplained details, until every word feels significant to the whole, and also, every word no longer seems to mean exactly what you though it meant before you began reading the story.

Gunshot is a collection of short stories that plays with a feeling of ultimate nightmare as written in realistic hops skips and jumps, where you might be just on the verge of waking up but then are swept back into a terrible/lovely fog (depending on how tough you are).Overall, a brilliant assembly of unpredictable chunks of storytelling that amazed in their wonder and amazed too in their horror, blood, puke, flayed skin, imprisonment.I found the stand out section of the book to be right smack in the middle. Gray fell into a pace, following the initial 80 something pages of perfect gloom, dread and violence, where she was writing stories that were more directly fables, puffy clouds with moments of solace, marvelous in execution and addictive as fuck to breeze through. I'm referring to the stories \"These Were the Fables\", \"Labyrinth\", \"Year of the Snake\" and \"The Heart\". Those stories were a turning point in the tone, that came as a relief ... early stories were heavier nightmare fuel, \"House Heart\", \"Away From\" and \"The Lark\" By page 143, with the story \"Viscera\" (aptly named) we're right back in the mix of earlier unsettling stories. They're return and the shift in tone of the book, back tot he dark, was the shit.

My favorite type of short stories sketch out something instantly recognizable in a very few sentences. With a simple exchange of dialogue one instantly ascertains the current state of a relationship and can guess at some of the history or with a twist of visual observation a reader intuits the state of mind of a protagonist. These sketches felt like a strange and shocking painting meant to elicit a wide range of instant gut responses like Munch\u2019s The Scream of Nature series but without the artist\u2019s historical annotations or illuminating title. Everyone has a different, personal reaction (mine to Gutshot typically \u201cew, gross\u201d) but context is not forthcoming so the reaction encompasses the entirety of the experience. Rather than \u2018stories\u2019 per se, each entry feels much more like the distillation of imagery from a dream fragment or drug hallucination. And sometimes a sentence is just plain stupid as with this opening winner: The sun beats the shit out of a dirty road called Raton Pass where the closest thing to a pair of matching earrings is a guy named Carl who punches you in the head with his fist. Trust me, there is no explaining why Carl is relatable in any way to a matched pair of earrings in the ensuing tale.I liked a whopping 5 of 37 stories and when I say \u201cliked,\u201d I don\u2019t mean they were enjoyable, usually the opposite. No, what I mean is I could see something identifiable: a relationship, a behavior, a quick insightful commentary for instance \"Attention is the most worthless of currency on the planet,\" I said. \"When you treat it like it's precious, you're blinding yourself to the possibility that you might find it elsewhere. And it's everywhere, attention is. . After the first few stories I knew never to get comfortable with \u201coh, finally we\u2019re going to have a story about something because Amelia Grey always takes it into WTF territory. I\u2019m not just talking about the bizarre or the ludicrous: I\u2019m talking pointless absurdity that appears purely for the purpose of eliciting a reaction. And perhaps that is what she is trying and succeeding at: make everything ludicrous, take something mundane and turn it ridiculous or grotesque as an \u201cF-you\u201d to anyone expecting normalcy. \u2018Ha readers! You want a nice story? Well life is a bizarre mind trip and then you die so jokes on you!\u2019 A very few actually hit a satirical note or elicited a \u201cha\u201d as I read. But most did not appear to have a point to the grotesquerie; no context, no metaphor, no deep statements for the reader...and that is precisely what frustrated this reader. Indeed there is likely (hopefully) meaning behind the tales but it is obscured through a single writers\u2019 vantage point and lifetime of unique context. We\u2019re being told about the weird dream (or nightmare) the acquaintance at the party wants to tell everyone about without seeming to notice everyone could care less. The snapshot only means something if one knows that Aunt Carol symbolizes friendships and eating is equivalent to sensuality and the forbidden because of the stint of anorexia in college and a car means a man in the dreamer\u2019s life so its super meaningful that she drove the car through her kitchen and then stabbed Aunt Carol 29 times when she exited then ate dear old auntie\u2019s eyeballs while a familiar-but-can\u2019t-place-it song was playing. I made that up\u2026 the version in Gutshot would have just jumped into the eating the eyeballs in the kitchen scene. The first story I \u2018liked\u2019 was The Moment of Conception and is a perfect example of my reading experience where I thought \u201cHey, this is a normal story about two people who are struggling to get pregnant\u201d all the while hating the niggling conviction that the author was soon going to screw with me: sure enough, Gray takes it to crazy town. The book is divided into five parts and each section progressively gains cohesiveness to the stories so I wish I had started in the middle or end because I may not have wanted to gouge out my eyeballs (or more in keeping with Grey - gouged out my lover\u2019s eyes and fried them up because he loves me so) by the time I arrived at the first appreciable story. I would loosely classify Part One as a \u201cCommunity\u201d theme, Part Two - \u201cRelationships,\u201d Part Three - \u201cTall Tales,\u201d Part Four - \u201cBlood and Guts\u201d and the final section as \u201cCrazy Time\u201d by which I mean both literal insanity and \u201csociety is crazy\u201d satirical commentary. Despite feeling the overall quality improves progressively, I preferred the \u201cTall Tales\u201d section the most. My favorite stories were Labryinth and Year of the Snake. Other shout-outs are Blood and Thank You which was actually pretty great and one of the few moments I laughed aloud. The Bottom Line: If I hadn\u2019t been prepared to justify my decision as a judge in the alt.TOB brackets, I would have put the book down at page 10, definitely by page 20, for sure after attempting two entire sections and wanting to kill someone. The writing itself I have no qualms with: the form is excellent and there is (usually) a beginning, middle and end to the stories. But the stories do not give back anything to the reader with the exception of those gut reactions. There is no illumination (quite the opposite) or context for greater meaning and the reactions get old quickly and lose their impact. Eventually one feels like the person next to the pair at a party who only make abstract insider references and jokes from their shared experience in their conversation. For some reason they believe they are actually conversing rather than just alluding to their past and they alienate everyone on the outside of the conversation. Literature should invoke a sense of recognition and empathy even when dealing with the most foreign topics and in my opinion Gutshot:Stories fails this primary task."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin", "userReview": "Gray\u2019s 37 short stories and flash fiction display her visceral and bizarre style teeming with unique and thought provoking ideas. One \u201cIn the Moment\u201dA couple lives together, practicing mindfulness, only to find a sense of emptiness. 4/5\u201cHouse Heart\u201dA couple pays for a girl to inhabit the ductwork of their home. This bizarre story looked at characters who felt they couldn\u2019t deal with reality, so in their own game, House Heart, find a sense of security. 4/5\u201cThe Lark\u201dA man who vomits after every sentence he utters, finds someone who isn\u2019t disgusted with him. A really short and strange story. 3/5\u201cPeople of the Bay\u201dA poet with plans for a city fails to listen to the protest of his people. This fable of a story shows creativity without a concern for reality and the voice of others. 3/5\u201cOn a Pleasant Afternoon, Every Battle is Recalled\u201dUlysses S. Grant recalls the past as he butchers a bird. It was an interesting historical perspective. 3/5\u201cMonument\u201dTownspeople set off to tidy up a cemetery take an unexpected turn of conformity. 4/5Two\u201cWestern Passage\u201dA woman picks up a girl on the bus, reasoning to save her from a man hitting on her, and takes her home. There were some interesting characters here. 4/5\u201cThe Death of James\u201dA wife cleans up the mess of her dead husband\u2014twisted and disturbing writing. 3/5\u201cA Gentleman\u201dA guy, who may or may not be a friend, tries to help a drunk woman\u2014a decent vignette with a character with questionable intentions. 3/5\u201cAway From\u201dA woman gets kidnapped by a neighbor. The detached style and possible analogy to dependence on drugs made this a disturbing read. 4/5\u201cFifty Ways to Eat Your Lover\u201dLiterally when your lover does something, respond with an act of violence, murder, and cannibalism\u2014graphic, experimental and if you have a dark sense of humor, hilarious. 4/5\u201cThe Moment of Conception\u201dDesperate to have a baby, a couple resorts to a twisted ritual\u2014how could anyone be okay with this? 3/5\u201cJourney\u2019s End\u201dThis story felt really vague, I assume it\u2019s about a survival situation? 2/5Three\u201cThese Are the Fables\u201dA couple in the mess of the world considers these experiences in light of preparing to have a child. This seemed incomplete. 2/5\u201cGutshot\u201dThe title story has a man get shot, only to find out he\u2019s not alone in his pain. 3/5\u201cHow He Felt\u201dA man in love tries to express it to the world only to find it loveless. 4/5\u201cLabyrinth\u201dA small town has its annual maze, now turned into a labyrinth with mythology and stories of a hero at the expense of reality. 4/5\u201cDevice\u201dAn inventor has a device to predict the future, a dangerous territory. 4/5\u201cThe Swan as Metaphor for Love\u201dThe swan is a literally a shitty metaphor for love as illustrated by this piece. 4/5\u201cYear of the Snake\u201dA giant snake slithers into town and divides it.

This seemed like a cool idea and it deserved more than two pages. 3/5\u201cGo For It and Raise Hell\u201dThis felt like a nice vignette of a guy driving in the desert imagining what his life is and isn\u2019t. 4/5\u201cThe Lives of Ghosts\u201dGhosts exist in pimples and blemishes on the body, it was strange, but also amusing. 4/5\u201cChristmas House\u201dA Christmas attraction explained by a vignette of sarcasm. 3/5Four\u201cViscera\u201dA story of how this book was made to how you\u2019ll die. This was a brilliant piece of flash fiction. 5/5\u201cDate Night\u201dDate night at a restaurant turns into mayhem when people start tearing themselves apart. 3/5\u201cCurses\u201dTwins curse their mother and watch as her health fails\u2014this was both funny and sad. 4/5\u201cBlood\u201dA story of friends and mosquitos\u2014I assume it was a reflection about a dear friend. 3/5\u201cPrecious Katharine\u201dA guy brings home a jar of something he names Katharine, and the rest didn\u2019t make any sense. It was bizarre. 3/5\u201cOn the Teat\u201dA son remains attached to his mother\u2014sort of weird and disturbing. 3/5Five\u201cFlight Log, Chicago/Toledo\u201dA flight log\u2014it seemed random and aimless. 2/5\u201cLoop\u201dA man notices his life is a loop, where everything\u2019s the same. 3/5\u201cThank You\u201dFriends sending thank you notes gets over the top ridiculous. 3/5\u201cLegacy\u201dWhat do you want to be buried with when you\u2019re dead?\u2014this was a fun and macabre read. 4/5\u201cThe Man Ahead\u201dA man shadows another man\u2014this was odd, and the detached style added to the creepiness. 4/5\u201cHouse Proud\u201dA mother and daughter relationship has them rediscover their love\u2014this was a resonant and sad story. 4/5As a whole, I found the short stories in this collection strong (\u201cHouse Heart\u201d \u201cWestern Passage,\u201d and \u201cHouse Proud\u201d to name a few), but I wish there were more as opposed to flash fiction. Gray writes whatever she wants, whether sarcastic, blunt, or shocking, and her style alone makes this worth reading. Nonetheless, some of her flash fiction seemed underdeveloped and more like experimental vignettes. She could\u2019ve fleshed out some more of them into full length short stories, and would\u2019ve captured more of my interest. Overall, this is a unique collection of original and strange stories by an author with a noteworthy style. 3.3/5"}, {"userName": "Rachel Le\u00f3n", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21291796-rachel-le-n", "userReview": "I'm completely torn as to whether give this book four stars or five, but I'm rounding up because holy shit Amelia Gray's mind is out of this world.

Joyous \u2013 because once you've let go of your boundaries, once the body becomes open and porous and wounded, you've got only yourself to explore. Words like \"wild\" and \"horror\" come to mind.Amelia Gray's fiction took me when I started to read \"The Swan as Metaphor for Love\" (which you can find over at Electric Literature. It's a brilliant deadpan deconstruction with whip-smart lines, wryly punctured and cunningly inflated at once. Take the following,Swans mate for life, which is maybe ten or fifteen years. Someone found a swan once that was twenty-four years old and probably it was mating for life, which everyone made a big deal out of even though the swan was not even old enough to rent a car. The swan wasn\u2019t yet acquainted with life enough to silently hyperventilate in its bed. The swan didn\u2019t have a bed. The swan was too stupid to have a bed and if it did it would fill the bed with swan shit.That\u2019s all for today about swans.Right there, that's a voice. I could listen all day, all night, always. For me, the best stories in Gutshot are those that maintain this painful off-handedness. \"Fifty Ways to Eat Your Lover,\" for instance, is uncompromising in its premise (Gray reads it aloud over YouTube, and \"Date Night\" came at just the right time for me (you can find it over at BOMB Magazine. \"Go for It and Raise Hell\" is an absolute barnburner and worth the price of admission alone (but you can go ahead and read it over at Knee-Jerk Magazine, in case you need persuasion. \"Thank You\" reminds me of more friends than I care to think, and myself more than I'd like to imagine.It's clear from the evidence presented in Gutshot that Gray has devastating power. The stories in which her voice catches, stories in which a narrative object emerges with such blistering, bloody, joyous clearness that you feel struck, are stories of rare comparison.

Initially, I was impressed with the surreal, nightmare quality of the pieces. However, the more I read, the more I realized why I responded to it: Gray writes stories like I did (or at least thought I did and wanted to) when I was a teenager. Stories that are built up out of disparate, often violent or disturbing images, with jumps of dream-logic that take Kafka and crank up the absurdity, with black humor shot throughout. Stories that subvert the narrative engine and try their best to break the canonical modes of literature. Basically, snot-nosed, rebellious fare. I certainly thought producing this stuff was great as a teen; unfortunately, it turns out that reading it as an adult is a distinctly less satisfying experience. The problem with subverting all expectations (or trying to) is that it becomes unbearably boring. If everything is possible, there's no surprise when the outlandish happens. The strength and value of subversion lies in the complicated relationship with the rules of the game: by turns embracing and rejecting literary and narrative tropes draws such tropes into relief, shows their weaknesses and strengths, and creates meaningful art. Banging together imagery salad that uses nightmare logic, lacunae of reasoning, nonstop nonsequiturs, and abrupt transitions and conclusions doesn't tell you anything enlightening about life, literature, etc. It just seems juvenile. I really wanted to like this book, but it felt painfully like reading what my 17 year old self would have tendentiously claimed was needed to raze the literary canon to the ground. Turns out callow youth is often wrong, and certainly hyperbolic. That is not to say Gray isn't a capable writer; it's just that she's not for the me of today. Got here 20 years too late, alas."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "Installment #3 of the tale of my April reading slump, in which I hit bottom.Continuing my lethal slide into reading apathy, I struggled through this collection of short stories. Gutshot was the May 2015 selection of the Nervous Breakdown Book Club. I had listened to the Other People podcast with Amelia Gray some months ago and she sounded fairly normal. Reader, she is not!I know there is a crossing-genres genre called The Weird and this collection would qualify. It is not Sci Fi but looks at a layer of society living probably right next to us but largely invisible. Messed up, weird people who do gross things and live outside what is thought of as mainstream. Do I need to be aware of these things? Do such people need a voice or a place in literature? While reading these stories, I would go to the grocery store or RiteAid or 7-11 and wonder if some of the humans I saw there might be like the people in the book. Major creep factor.Out of the 35 mostly very short stories, I only found 4 that were tolerable. \"Western Passage,\" \"Gutshot,\" \"Year of the Snake,\" and \"Legacy.\" I am sorry Amelia Gray.
