The very FIRST page is captivating. You immediately want to know who this guy is and what is going on. That continues ALL the way through. I was absorbed in the characters. I wanted to know WHY they were the way they were. I wanted to know if they would be able to work it out or not. Not once did I get bored or want to put it down!The way the author wrote this story was amazing to me. Just as I was getting to know a character and really want to know the details, the author switched it and put you in a different character's head. I found this to be both intriguing and frustrating (in a good way). I wanted to find out what the rest of the story was with the character so the author FULLY had my attention and I did NOT want to put this book down!Let this be a warning to you all, you WILL cry when you read this. The last few chapters had me crying so hard I could hardly see the book. The emotions were radiating off the pages and I felt like I was there in real life watching all of this unfold. That just amazes me that a book could be so well written like that! Props to you Karen Kingbury! This is one of the best books I have ever read and I am proud to add it to my personal library!!!"}, {"userName": "Chantel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5822088-chantel", "userReview": "I really wanted (and tried) liking this book, but it just wasn't for me.

I was introduced to her books a couple years ago and every time I read one, the same thing happens... I cannot put it down. I started this book Friday evening and was so involved in the world of the Barrett family, that I did not want to leave, so I continued to read page after page until I finally finished somewhere around 2 a.m. Before I go into all the reasons why this book touched me so, I would like to tell you a little about the author. Karen Kingsbury is a Christian writer and puts not only her love for the Lord in every book, but really tries to connect with readers on a personal level. This particular book was her first novel, and with it being so, happened to be somewhat autobiographical. For those of you who are hesitant to read any book that is labeled \"Christian\" for whatever reason, I would ask you to give this author a chance. Not once have I felt like her books were preaching at me, or trying to make me believe a certain religion is better than another. They are just stories that make you remember that God is good, and he does good things in our lives, and no matter how far we've wondered, or how big our problem may seem to us, they are never too big for Him in all his mighty power. This story begins with John Barrett the father of Ellen, Jane, Megan, Amy and Aaron collapsing from a heart attack in the hallway. His last minutes are spent looking up at the pictures of his children hanging on the wall. As the family comes together to mourn the loss of their father, they are struggling to make it through one week together as all their past demons resurface. Throughout this one week, temptation, old sibling rivalries, and hidden secrets are keeping these five children and their mother from offering each other the kind of comfort and emotional support they are all looking for. Ellen, the oldest daughter, is struggling to find the outlet to grieve that she desperately needs, only to be brushed off by her husband because he is busy with work and does not like funerals. As the week begins and she is constantly being snubbed and criticized by her next sister, Jane, she find herself turning to her first true love, whom she never really stopped loving. Having him drop everything to be by her side almost proves too much for Ellen to bear as she watches her family fall apart around her. Jane, being the only sibling to have children of her own, is struggling with an emotionally scarring secret that she has never before shared with anyone. Right before she leaves to join her family for the funeral preparations, she finally tells her husband why it is that she does not feel anything about the death of her father. My heart breaks for Jane as she is constantly attacking Ellen, much to the other's dismay for what seems to be for no particular reason. Megan, still living in the same town as her parents offers to let Ellen, Jane and her children stay with her. Trying to be the referee and keep the girls from each other's throats proves to be an emotionally draining task for Megan. She is just trying to abide by their mothers wishes that for one week, they act like a family who cares about each other. Amy, the youngest girl, has always felt like she is being ignored and cutoff by the others, and does not go anywhere without her husband. As the story progresses, you see a transformation in Amy, as she starts to stand up for herself and show the others that she is an adult just like they are.Aaron, being the only boy in the family has a rough time showing his emotions. Whenever he is confronted, Aaron become violent and then abruptly will disappear in his car. As the funeral approached, their mother asks each of them to write a few words about their father for them to read at the ceremony. Ellen, being a writer has no problem with this, and takes the time to help some of the others who are struggling with what to say. The purpose is to share with everyone what their father meant to them, and their family. The ending to this book proved to be very emotional for me on several levels. As each of the children approach the podium to share their stories it becomes clear that each child saw their father in a different light. For each of them, he was the man they needed him to be. Whether that be a cheerleader, an ear to listen, a shoulder to cry on, or just a friend, John Barrett was that for each of his children, loving all of them equally in the way that was most important and meaningful for them. Anyone who has ever lost a family member, or had a fight with a sibling will find someone in this book that they can relate to. It shows how wonderful the power of family can really be, and that in the end, you can always turn to your family for support, no matter how far away you've drifted over the years. There is something very special about the bonds of a family intertwined with the power of prayer."}, {"userName": "LadyCalico", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2288360-ladycalico", "userReview": "This book was so bad that it makes me ill that I wasted good money on it. The story just doesn't ring true, and the phoniness of the characters with their unrealistic responses really grated on my nerve. So Ellen's supposed to be responsible for her idiot sister's rape (exactly how makes no sense at all) so everybody still hates her many years later, and all the other gutless morons let the idiot sister run roughshod over them no matter how idiotically bad the idiot behaves. The idiot sister, although supposedly totally damaged, still somehow manages to be a great wife and mother, even though her husband is a castrated wonder who doesn't seem to care that his wife wastes so much of her life making a total idiot of herself with embarrassing hysterics and pure meanness. The boorish and boring behavior is taking place at a funeral no less. Kingsbury must have been in a contest with someone to see who could create the biggest pile of soap opera histrionics, and apparently won. On the plus side I did like the brother Aaron because he was smart enough to run away from this ridiculous story as fast as possible and as often as possible--the only one in this story with a human brain. For soap opera fanatics only. I have since read other Kingsbury books that were much better, and some that were really bad--but none as bad as this."}, {"userName": "Michelle Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3485266-michelle-robinson", "userReview": "I wish I had not made such a harsh statement about Jane in my updates. She was horrible. I know she had reasons but the hate and bitterness she had were over the top. She and Aaron both seemed to be stuck in very adolescent stages of development. I understand why but it was still hard to listen to after a while.I thought the ending was a little too pat for such a miserable dysfunctional group and it did not feel realistic. THe mother was a paragon, there is no way I could have been as patient as she if my children behaved this horribly so soon after I lost my husband. I had to go to the library and get this as a book because the play away stopped working halfway through, it was easier to read than to listen to.

If one more person cried, I thought I would strangle them through the pages! Yes, a father's funeral is very sad, and old family hurts seem to inflame emotions during stressful times, but the week with the Barretts gave me a headache... I don't feel sorry for people who are hurt and want their friends/family to read their minds as to the reasons... talk, people! It's called communication!

All the books by Karen Kingsbury have so far. There was laughter, crying, anger, and so much more. This story was so heartfelt. Ellen Barrett overcame so many things in this story. It reminded me a little of a Nicholas Sparks book I read. Which this one came out first but I read his first. But they ended completely different. I think everyone should read Karen Kingsbury books. They are just THAT good. Inspirational, heartfelt, heartwarming, sincere, breathtaking, so many words describe this one story.

Then again, if they read this one they might not read any of her others. The inter-family fighting is so strong in this book that I actually had to put it down and step away from it for several days.

Not teen fiction, not dystopian, and not exactly a love story, at least romantic. There were so many dynamic characters, I could see this as one of those movies where everyone is an A- list actor, and there's tons of drama. It was a journey of self- reflection, of a woman's journey to understand herself and her family as they grieve her father's death. It was real, personal, intense. It could truly be what's going on in your life or someone you know. You saw the struggles of each member of the family as they had to face their personal demons to not only mourn their father but heal their hurts. It shows how a family that was once sweet can get so twisted but with God can again be restored. How even those who know Christ can struggle in marriage and relationship. We aren't perfect. But this was a story of redemption, of restoration, of God's never-ending love and faithfulness. At times I struggled to read it, because it was different, slower, not action packed, and especially during the funeral, I don't do well with death lately, but I'm glad I pushed through to the end. It was beautiful. And restored a part of me that was shrinking.

The core of the story is sad, a dysfunctional family gathers together to bury their much-loved father. Throughout the book, the main character, Ellen, makes some really stupid choices that completely irritated me (I.e. Meeting up with an old boyfriend because her husband stayed home) and her sister Jane was totally unlikable. I almost stopped reading because of the way she treated people.

Maybe because of the family issues involved. I have read some reviews that state it is ridiculous because a married Christian woman would meet up with an old boyfriend and almost have an affair. Really?In the book Ellen was struggling with her marriage due to reasons unknown to her at the time (or she did not take time to see them). When she went back home for her father's funeral with all of her siblings and things were very strange there with one sister being a hateful brat, why would not you not try to reconnect with something in your past you thought was easy. Her reunion with Jake was a way to realize she cared for him because of their history but she loved her husband and realized that. Almost affairs when you are unhappy with a spouse???? Why not???? Satan loves to move in on those emotions. I felt the story line was right on.Sibling issues happen in every family. This on was extreme and went through a lot of challenges to get to the point where the loved again. Satan loves those issues too and will not let go until God is allowed to be there. A person has to let God break down those walls around hearts that are hardened like stone.I loved the book because it gives a look at how we all struggle with inner things and how if we only allow the one true Father, Friend, Bridegroom into our inner most being, things can be better and we can love again."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511537-barbara", "userReview": "Karen Kingsbury seems to be an expert at fully involving you emotionally in her character's lives. Family relationship dynamics, dealing with grief, the lasting effects of severe trauma, and the healing and growth that openness and forgiveness can bring are some of the major themes of this novel. Karen seems to have a gift of creating characters that seem so real they almost feel like they are personal friends, and the circumstances and choices they deal with are those which we all confront at times. I understand the comments of others about the small storyline comparing the Catholic and Protestant viewpoints, but I didn't feel Karen meant them to seem like \"Catholic bashing,\" but simply a conflict within this particular family. Because the storyline centers on a family dealing with the unexpected death of their husband/father, I knew it would not be cheerful, but the majority of the book was so tense and sad that I wouldn't want to read it at a hard time in my own life. I think it could have been improved if some of the issues had been resolved a little bit earlier in the book so that we could have a longer glimpse of the renewed relationships afterward."}, {"userName": "Tima", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5300365-tima", "userReview": "Ellen is a top-notch reporter who lives a very busy life with her husband Michael.

Frustrating because the siblings in the story didn't seem to real. The family use to be full of love and laughter and it seemed strange that ALL five siblings could be so emotionally damaged and the parents not be seriously concerned. The mom seemed checked out and the brother almost autistic and yet no mention was made about either of these. It was heartbreaking because the author wrote the story to be sad. She did a great job of making the sadness and agony of death seem real. I definitely didn't get bored with the story because it seemed to move along quickly.

Another being the draw that the character feels to her first love-- I think that is a topic that is often not explored with Christians-- women nor men-- if they are Christians and married-- any mention of former lives is often taboo. But the reality is, bonds are formed with people we've once dated-- especially if the relationship wasn't pure. The main character of this book as it a cross-roads in her life-- she is having some marriage issues with her work-aholic husband and her father just died-- she returns to her hometown to strained relationships with her siblings-- all mourning their father in different ways-- naturally, she feels compelled to talk to a man she spend a large portion of her life with.This book was a realistic look into family dynamics among adult siblings, as well as into a marriage and the need to return to the past into order to heal and move forward."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1432707-susan", "userReview": "It was about a family who lost their father and returns to their hometown for the funeral.

Too much contention!Update: I decided to finish this book since I was pretty sure the author would turn it around. Well, I think she did. The first part of the book would get a 1, the second half a 3 so it gets a 2 overall.
