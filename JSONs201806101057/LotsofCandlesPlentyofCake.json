In Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake, Quindlen offers her readers a roadmap for growing older while still enjoying life. An informative and thought provoking while at times humorous memoir, Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake invites us into Quindlen's life and allows us to feel comfortable there. Born in 1953 during the baby boom, Anna Quindlen is the oldest of five children. Forced to become mother to her younger siblings at age nineteen following her mother's untimely death, Quindlen uses this marker as a means to not be afraid of aging. Entering the work force in 1974 while women were beginning to crack the glass ceiling, she at many points in her career was the token woman in the newsroom and on journalistic panels. All of these experiences allowed her to impart wisdom on the next generation as they came of age and started their professional and domestic careers. Having children in her thirties rather than her twenties allowed for Quindlen and her husband Gerry to have more life experiences to share with their children Quin, Chris, and Maria. Because the life expectancy in the United States has reached eighty years and adolescence lasts into one's twenties, Quindlen is able to enjoy a close relationship with her children long into their adulthood. While they are able to share lasting memories, they also turn to their parents for advice on everything from writing a job application to what type of person to date and hopefully marry. With over sixty years of life experience behind her, Quindlen is happy to enjoy her job as full time mom much longer than her parents' or grandparents' generations ever did.I enjoyed reading about Quindlen's memories growing up, as a New York Times reporter, and as a mother. Even though I am from the generation as her children, I could relate to her stories about motherhood, making the decision to work from home while raising the children, and choosing when to allow her children to do things for themselves rather than being what she terms a helicopter mom. As she has cut back on her role as full time mother, she has tried new activities late in her fifties. She views the next thirty or so years of her life as the next great adventure. The greatest lesson I can take from Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake is that just because someone is growing old does not mean that they can not enjoy life to the fullest. A person in their fifties can earn a PhD, learn how to do a headstand, or travel to China. A person in their seventies can volunteer at local organizations and act as a mentor to the younger generations. In what I view as a how to for the rest of my life, I enjoyed reading Quindlen's take on life, which I rate four stars."}, {"userName": "Skostal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352482-skostal", "userReview": "I was a big fan of Quindlen's in the 1980s. Her NYT columns were among the first to chronicle, in real time, what is was like for working mothers struggling to balance it all, especially in male-dominated fields. She struck innumerable chords, and made our individual struggles, whether we had children yet or not, seem, if not noble, than at least normal. She was like a great travel writer, telling me about country I would someday visit.Fast-forward 30 years, however, and Quindlen's work, while still well written, lacks any punch. She has had, unfortunately, too good of a life. Yes, her mother died when she was 19 and she raised her younger siblings. But to hear Quindlen tell it, everything has been hunky dory since then. Great husband, they make plenty of money, her children are grown and launched, and yet she cannot stop talking about how raising them has been the pinnacle event of her life. There is nothing about sex, arguments with spouses or partners, crises of confidence, true fears of aging. With a house in NY and one in the country, Quindlen's life is too soft, even if she is working out with a personal trainer. She writes about Boomers as if no one had before. Her observations are true, but obvious. The book jacket shows her in a comfortable leather chair in front of a fireplace, any worry lines smoothed out by Botox, and that sums up the book: she is too comfortable, too languid, too willing to hide whatever insecurities and fears she holds. She is capable of an edgy honesty in her fiction that she has lost in her memoir. And that's sad."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "At age 60, Anna Quindlen has already had plenty of candles and birthday cake, but she wants more. A lot more. Her own mother died in her early 40s, when Anna was just nineteen. That early loss has made her grateful for every additional year she gets that her mother was denied. Anna's gratitude is the common ingredient that ties together these ruminations of an aging feminist baby boomer. She seems amazed, even somewhat astonished, at how fortunate she has been. She has reached an age where she can look back and recognize the combination of ambition and serendipity that allowed her to \"have it all\" in terms of marriage, motherhood, career, and friendship. These essays will of course have the most appeal for those in Quindlen's age range whose life paths have somewhat paralleled hers. But if you've read her work before, you know she always shares observations and wisdom that are universally relevant. I like her spunk. I like her honesty. Most of all, I like the way she always manages to say the things I feel but cannot put into words. I recommend the book for all connoisseurs of life."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "[Mirror, MirrorI\u2019ve aged well but because I\u2019ve aged into how I always looked.

They're so eager and so smart, with their dresses and their shiny hair, and we know exactly what they want because we once wanted it, too. They want a formula, a plan,a set of directions, an assembly kit. Connect A to B, C to D, and in the end, there it is, the life you crave. The job, the salary, the companion, the home. It's so hard to tell them the truth, that there is no formula, no plan. It's harder still to communicate that your life has been filled with accidents and that they have determined so much of how things turned out. Some have been happy accidents, some not. There were plans for a family but the right partner didn't come along, or came along too late. There were plans for a big family but after the first child there was no other, or plans for an only child that were changed by an accidental pregnancy. My early plans to have no children at all morphed into plans to have four, and we wound up with three. And now that seems exactly right, even fated somehow. It's amazing how resilient people are, and how the things that didn't come true become, after a while, simply the way things are. THE BLURB: \u201c[Quindlen] serves up generous portions of her wise, commonsensical, irresistibly quotable take on life. . . . What Nora Ephron does for body image and Anne Lamott for spiritual neuroses, Quindlen achieves on the home front.\u201d\u2014NPRIn this irresistible memoir, Anna Quindlen writes about a woman\u2019s life, from childhood memories to manic motherhood to middle age, using the events of her life to illuminate ours. Considering\u2014and celebrating\u2014everything from marriage, girlfriends, our mothers, parenting, faith, loss, to all the stuff in our closets, and more, Quindlen says for us here what we may wish we could have said ourselves. As she did in her beloved New York Times columns, and in A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen uses her past, present, and future to explore what matters most to women at different ages. Quindlen talks aboutMarriage: \u201cA safety net of small white lies can be the bedrock of a successful marriage. You wouldn\u2019t believe how cheaply I can do a kitchen renovation.\u201dGirlfriends: \u201cAsk any woman how she makes it through the day, and she may mention her calendar, her to-do lists, her babysitter. But if you push her on how she really makes it through her day, she will mention her girlfriends. \u201dOur bodies: \u201cI\u2019ve finally recognized my body for what it is: a personality-delivery system, designed expressly to carry my character from place to place, now and in the years to come.\u201dParenting: \u201cBeing a parent is not transactional. We do not get what we give. It is the ultimate pay-it-forward endeavor: We are good parents not so they will be loving enough to stay with us but so they will be strong enough to leave us.\u201dCandid, funny, and moving, Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake is filled with the sharp insights and revealing observations that have long confirmed Quindlen\u2019s status as America\u2019s laureate of real life.MY THOUGHTS: I liked Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake by Anna Quindlen, but I didn't love it. I think I was expecting something quite different from what I actually got. This is not so much a memoir, as a philosophical essay on aging. I was expecting more of Anna's life. She does make reference to incidents in her life from time to time to illustrate a point she is making, but that is all. And while I may feel slightly disappointed, Quindlen makes a lot of valid points about aging, about how we are aging differently to how our parents aged and to how our children will age. She talks about the opportunities and choices we had that our parents never had, and how many more of these our children have. I think that this is a book that I will pick up again in the future and reread. While I didn't find it funny, there is a great deal of wisdom contained within. And next time I read this, I will be ready for it. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own.

While I was reading this novel, I kept thinking I was reading about Anne Tyler's life. This book is more like vignettes into Anna Quindlen's life. I was immediately taken with the writing- every sentence, paragraph, and page was filled to the brim with words that brought her story to life for me. She starts out the book strong and projecting equal opportunity for those taking the road less traveled. I found myself pumping my fist in unison with some of her expressions and quotes she expertly wove into her narrative. Clearly, her family is most important to her (as it should be) and she continues to beat that point home. Towards the end, I found myself mired with reading what seemed like the same thing over and over again. I can't fault her gorgeous prose- the woman has a way with words. At the end of the book, I thought to myself \"hmm- seems so perfectly wrapped up in a tidy little bow\" which is exactly how I would write stories about my life while living in my 60's. Idyllic that Quindlen can cherish and appreciate the privilege she has been afforded."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251567-karen", "userReview": "What is it like to be a Mother, a woman, a working woman, a feminist, a baby boomer...or someone who's aging, who is at the end of their life with little options? What is faith, motherhood, marriage, work, being a woman, friendship, love, life, or God forbid, death? What in our life are absolutely not necessary or important? I used to read Anna Quindlen's column religiously, not because we have a similar life as other readers claimed (her kids are older, her career is more successful, she's happily married...), it's because no one can analyze a complex situation or phenomenon, then is also able to explain it simply yet eloquently with a dash of humor. She can see everyday situation that we encounter in a deeper sense, in which she contributed to the loss of her Mom at a tender age of 19. She explained why mortality is always on her mind:\"But the gift that some of us have been given, in exchange for terrible loss, is the gift of that knowledge.\"Being able to see and feel things deeply enables her to write in a language unlike all others. Her word choices are simple although carefully chosen and perfectly arranged. Yet they strike the perfect chord in my heart. Her advices are insightful, brilliant and sad in a way. The life that all of us women have to go through...We thought we had it so perfectly planned, not to avoid mistakes, not to delay anything or miss opportunities...We wanted the perfect job, the perfect husband, kids at the right age, yet the outcome is usually unpredictable. We go through exactly the same cycle, the generation before us, and the generation after us, although many circumstances have changed, most for the better.\"I would tell my twenty-two-year-old self that what lasts are things so ordinary she may not even see them: family dinners, fair fights, phone calls, friends. But of course the young woman I once was cannot hear me, not just because of time and space but because of the language, and the lessons, she has yet to learn. It's a miracle: somehow over time she learned them all just the same, by trial and error.\"The whole book is full of insightful and poignant writings like the above, I highlighted all of them so I could go back and re-read them, think about them, ponder about her words, and how similar they are to my own, and many other women in the same stage of their life.\"There comes that moment when we finally know what matters and, perhaps more important, what doesn't, when we see that all the life lessons came not form what we had but from who we loved, and from the failures perhaps more than the successes...\"She also talked about our affinity to possessions, our refusal to retire or acknowledge mortality. She explained what a longer life expectancy and better healthcare has changed our expectation of life...for both better or worse. She explained the wonder of having girlfriends, although they might be different ones in different stages of our life. She indicated that women's movement has bought us great changes, thanks to all the women before us, but we are not yet there...Everything that we encounter or to be encountered in our life as a woman is in this gem of a book. I highly recommend it to all \"finely aged\" women out there. However, I do think that younger women will find this book useful, if they don't see it as preachy due to their age. Finally, Quindlen said since we don't have an absolute definition of \"old\", she was going to give it one:\"...OLD is wherever you haven't gotten to yet.\"\"When I think of that future, I know that my choices will narrow, have been narrowing as surely as a perspective drawing leading the eye to the focal point. I won't be going to medical school and becoming a surgeon. I'm not going to live in Italy or learn Chinese. I may have to become more thrifty and less spontaneous, may be lonelier and needier than I'd like...\"But, as she wrote, drawing is okay, sitting in a big chair with a long book is okay, spending long hours pulling together ingredients for a stew and staying inside all day while its aroma seeps into every corner of the house is okay, eating alone while reading a book is also okay. Life is....to be continued."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9268585-deborah", "userReview": "I like Anna Quindlen a lot. I think she's a very good writer who writes about important subject.However, it turns out that she is a better read for articles. An entire book is too much to read all at once.The difficulty lies in getting to know her too well. She is actually younger than I, and espouses a heightened consciousness about working women. But the privilege is very hard to take in large doses, and her feminism is just too tinged with lack of discernment about class and race issues. I'm going back to her, but in small doses."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "You will love this book from the very first paragraph. It is about every woman's concerns from Day One of their worrying years. You will laugh and say to yourself....\"oh my, how true.\" Or....\"wow...that happened to me.\"Each chapter had a topic that was very poignant and one that will make you reflect as you read through the incidents and facts. The chapter titled Generations and the chapter titled To Be Continued definitely brought tears to my eyes. Another chapter titled Older will make you laugh out loud. Your emotions will be taken on a fun, wild ride with every chapter. Be prepared for tears and laughter as well as sound advice along with points to ponder...especially in the last chapter.The book was factual but personal because it brought many private topics to light. Any woman over 50 should enjoy this book. Younger women may laugh, but may not get the full impact. It is a great, light read for the most part. Some comments especially about our children and the role they play in our lives really hit home and how we as women need each other to make it all happen for us. The author also comments that it certainly is a blessing that we were born when we were and not when our mothers had been born and that each generation most probably will look back on some of the strides made and think that event wasn't a big deal because that had been happening for a while. Take the time to read and enjoy the book and your life....that is what Anna Quindlen taught me."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "I listened to the audio of this book and was brought into the world of Anna Quindlen, told in her own voice. I have not read her nonfiction before, but have devoured her fiction work. This was a wonderful look at the woman behind the stories I have loved. Women who were growing up in the 60's and 70's will relate so well to this book. I am not sure the younger generation will but they could learn quite a lot if they were so inclined. She talks of changes in the role of women, balancing careers and motherhood, reaching for the brass ring among many other things. She does a wonderful job of comparing her mothers life to her own and yet again to her daughters generation. She does it with a wit and wisdom that does come with age, with the ability to look at yourself honestly and appreciate who you are and how you got to this point. If you are of this generation....then you will catch yourself nodding your head, laughing out loud and recalling your own coming of age in this ever-changing world. I could relate to so much that she shares....our own mothers, our breaking the housewife mold and joining the work force, raising a much more enlightened generation of children. But most of all, I took away a feeling of joy, at being of a certain age and being good with who I am. That our 50's and 60's are not the \"old age\" of the generation before. She shared a quote from a friend who had become a grandmother...and said: \"You are never too old to have the best day of your life.\" I hope this is true.  She delves quite a bit into the loss of her own Mother when she was young, and I think this has probably shaped her writing quite a bit. She shares her thoughts on many a hot topic....religion, aging, parenting, etc....and at times seemed to drone on a bit, but overall this was a wonderful book to listen to. Her opinions have me reflecting on my own life.....the past and all those memories, and the future which I can only hope holds many more."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "(4.5) A splendid memoir-in-essays that dwells on aging, parenting and female friendship. Some of its specific themes are marriage, solitude, the randomness of life, the process of growing into your own identity, and the special challenges her generation (roughly my mother\u2019s) faced in seeking a work\u2013life balance. Her words are witty and reassuring, and cut right to the heart of the matter in every case. I can\u2019t think why I hadn\u2019t read anything by Quindlen until now, but I can highly recommend her to fans of Gail Caldwell, Anne Lamott, Betsy Lerner (The Bridge Ladies), Ann Patchett (especially This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage) and May Sarton. I marked out so many passages, but here are a few favorites:\u201cYou never listen to me. You always forget. You never help. You always say that. You never do that. Petty grievances in marriage are like hothouse tomatoes: they get way bigger than they ought to, and they bear little resemblance to the real thing.\u201d\u201cIt may be that all people become more of whatever they mostly are as they grow older, the good as well as the bad: more outspoken, less inhibited, funnier, more gregarious. Sometimes it seems as though age strips away the furbelows, the accessories, and leaves just the essential person\u201d\u201cOh, those little stories we tell ourselves. They make us what we are, and too often, what we\u2019re not. They are the ten commandments of incapability, cut to order. I can\u2019t cook. I\u2019m not smart. I\u2019m a bad driver. I\u2019m no jock. Maybe they\u2019re even true. It\u2019s hard to tell at a certain point. The little stories we tell ourselves become mythic, difficult if not impossible to discount or overcome.

One True Thing stands as one of my all time favorites, and I gave it 5 stars, which I only bestow upon a select few. With that being said...onto this review.There were parts of the book that were 4 or 5 star worthy. Unfortunately this was marred by the author seeming to forget that she is speaking from a place in life that most women her age have never experienced, and most likely never will. Give me the gritty story of a woman who fought her way tooth and nail through difficulties and struggle and emerged victorious, over the one where she lives a comfortable life with summer homes, long months spent writing without distraction, vacations, etc. This is not to criticize her for her story or her voice in any way, and to be married to one person for decades is an accomplishment if it is happy. However, she over generalizes and makes statements that are from her personal experience and her opinion as if she is Buddha telling the rest of us pearls of wisdom that are relevant to us all. For instance, she states that unhappily married people should stay together for the sake of the children. This is easy to say when you have not been unhappily married, or even more so when you have not been the child of two unhappily married people. Each situation is different and can only be judged by the individuals living it. There was only one reference to another point of view, which I believe was her sister, who was divorced and living happily on her own. When asked why she had not remarried, she said \"It would take a hell of a man to replace no man at all.\" Amen, sister!"}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "I've read all of Quindlen's novels, but have avoided every one of her non-fiction books because that's usually what I do with non-fiction, avoid it. I listened to this so I could have the author herself speak to me, and it was very enjoyable if you don't mind the New York accent, and I don't. She mainly writes about motherhood, so this memoir is no different. But if that was all she wrote about, she wouldn't be my favorite author of the.moment. She discusses how times have changed from when she was a young adult to now, when young adults stuggle to find meaningful employment. She talks about women in the workplace, and how it's changed from when her mother worked prior to getting married.

I *do* like Anna Quindlen. Perhaps if I were 10-15 years older, I would have read and treasured this compliation of \"life lessons\" from the spunky and witty authoress. But her middle-age monologue about life as an upper-middle class or lower-upper class woman just wore on me a bit too much. Yes, I would love a summer house in New England and write for three months, taking a break from Nick and the boys; but still be madly in love with them as well. But that shit isn't gonna happen. So, I'll keep living with them and not writing, or painting, or making tiaras during the summer months in glorious half-to-whole solitude. Perhaps, when I hit 60 and hopefully retire from work to dedicate my time to writing the novel about the underground life after apocalypse, or adding research and notes to Nick and my history of film watching together - I'll be able to reflect upon my life as a young and creative mother, a charming co-worker, and the grandest lover."}, {"userName": "Rachyl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20574948-rachyl", "userReview": "Okay, this seems harsh, because it isn't a bad book - for those it's actually meant for - but hear me out:This was the sort of book that you read in order to find yourself in its pages. As someone really far away from her targeted demographic I did not identify with much. I found that the author wasn't particularly interested in explaining her opinions \u2013 only stating them for others who could relate. I had hoped that I would gain some deeper understanding of the perspectives from those of her generation, but mostly I just got kind of the surface stuff that I'd more or less figured out for myself. The book as a whole seemed like someone reminiscing with her friends \u2013 I was not one of her friends. There were some things that I got out of the book. I enjoyed the bits where she talked about her perspectives of the relations between generations. And the chapter on mortality was also more interesting because that was a view that it seemed like she didn't share with her peers. Coming from different times we have different issues we face as well. Topics that seemed revolutionary to her were things that were obvious to me; insights that could have potentially been revolutionary for me were not fleshed out enough to allow them to be. I had a hard time getting behind her writing style too. It seemed like she rambled a lot and was constantly straying from the topic that was intended to be discussed in each chapter. At times I noticed that she seemed to contradict herself or try a little too hard to sound poetic or worldly. It also seemed like she made huge generalizations on the experiences of her generation. I wouldn't know if these are experiences that are universal to those women she considers her peers, but I did notice that there was a huge lack of actual references to studies/polls (there could be more, but I really only remember one). It just seemed like she took that idea from her younger years that other women really saw themselves in her life and so she took that as the fact that all did. And it just made me a little uncomfortable to think about applying her personal opinions to all the women I know of the boomer generation who don't seem to think that way. Honestly, I dreaded picking it up and had a very difficult time finishing it. I'm sure this is a book that really connects with a lot of women, but though I would have loved to get some deeper understanding of what they go/went through this book failed to provide that to me. Maybe it's like she says in the beginning \u2013 that the younger generations fail to understand the ideas of the older ones \u2013 but that is because we are very different and the experiences of her time don't exactly perfectly apply to the issues of today."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "This was outside my usual reading range. I was looking at it because I'd come across some enthusiastic reviews and I thought it might be a nice gift for a sibling. I can see why Quindlen is a popular writer: she articulates those things about her life (our lives) that are peculiar and noteworthy and sometimes stressful and talks about them with us. It must be a great relief for some folks to discover that here is someone who thinks exactly like them.However, I may be a bit of an outlier. I have some of the same feelings, thoughts, ambitions as the next guy (gal) but perhaps it all seems a little too avuncular. I like the idea of laughing at the human predicament: collecting things, growing old, developing illnesses, etc. but somehow I didn't find the deeper message and it wasn't funny enough."}, {"userName": "Barbara Burd", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2265122-barbara-burd", "userReview": "I really enjoy Anna Quindlen's style and her writing is unsurpassed. This book was enjoyable, but as a working slightly past middle aged woman, I found it difficult to relate to her in many areas. She has lived a privileged lifestyle thaT she assumes is common to everyone. The first essays in this book address the accumulation and comfort she has found in the \"stuff\" that makes up her life and while in the end she suggests that possessions aren't important, she fondly talks about her homes and apartments. And in an essay discussing aging, she decries plastic surgery and reconstructing appearances while admitting to Botox and other treatments. I don't believe hers is a common experience. She provides a glimpse into a different lifestyle, but not necessarily those of the common woman."}, {"userName": "Su", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/804502-su", "userReview": "I will begin this review by stating that if you are approaching sixty, or have already passed that golden age, this is a must read book.

Part of it is a feeling that her essays have become (dare I say it?) a little self-congratulatory (Christ, there is even a Q&A with MERYL STREEP (!!) at the end of this book which is a real pat-ourselves-on-the-backs), and the other part is a feeling that Anna does not exactly inhabit the world of real working women anymore and does not seem to understand what it is like for the rest of us. Yes, Anna and I were both career women living in NYC in the 80s, but my current life does not involve a three story brownstone on the UES and a country house, and her essays regarding her overwhelming satisfaction with both places rubs a little. And while it is fine for Anna to say that elderly people should be able to age and eventually die in their own homes, I am very sure that she has the financial ability to hire live-in help and renovate her father's home should he become infirm, but not all of us have that ability, and so, it chafes a little for Anna to pass judgment on decisions that some of us have to make.While I used to feel like I could sit down with Anna and have a few cocktails and a real conversation, I have come to see that I was somewhat misguided in imaging that scenario. (Besides, she doesn't see the point in drinking, as one essay explains.)"}, {"userName": "Larry Bassett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett", "userReview": "OK, so this is the question: What is a guy doing reading a book that a gal wrote for other gals? Well, one reason is that this is a book about what it is like to be a woman. I want to know about that. When there is an M box and an F box, the answer is easy. Unless you think about it. I mean, gender is probably a continuum, right? Lots of shades of differences and variations for all of us. Many of think of life as (pardon the phrase) black or white. A or B. M or F. But there is a feminine part of me and I want to know more about it since mostly the world around me points me in the M direction.When I was young and lived in the liberal town of Ann Arbor, I once went to a book store. It was a women\u2019s book store. When I got there, there was a sign on the door that basically said, \u201cIf you are a man, we can\u2019t tell you not to come in, but we would prefer if you didn\u2019t.\u201d I was despondent. I didn\u2019t go in. But I was hurt.So today, when I see a book labeled chick lit, I try not to feel hurt. But I am. Why shouldn\u2019t I be allowed to freely read this book? I like to think that Anna would agree that it is OK! In fact, I would like to think that she would think that it is a good idea for me to read this book. But I am not sure she really does think that. We build our lives bit by bit of small bricks, until by the end there\u2019s a long stretch of masonry. But one of the amazing, and frightening, things about growing older, about seeing yourself surrounded by the Great Wall of Life, is that you become aware of how random the construction is, how many times it could have gone a different way, the mistakes you averted, not because you were wise, perhaps, but because you were lucky. . . At the time you think that\u2019s just how it is. And when years after, when you consider all the ways in which things went differently for people like you, you wonder. Let me make a gross exaggeration here. I think this book is at least as much about femininity as about feminism. That disappoints me because I have viewed the author predominantly as a modern progressive woman. I thought she came across as much more of a traditionalist here, talking about traditional women\u2019s roles. (For example, she talks about her use of \u201cbeauty\u201d products and even Botox.) If you read the book, you will undoubtedly find plenty of counterexamples in this relatively short book, but I think Quindlen\u2019s balance is at least slightly in the direction of putting women in the sexist box that they have (in my opinion) been trapped in for a long time. This factor loses a star for me and makes me think I could have skipped this book. If I had borrowed this book from the library instead of actually buying it, I might have taken it back unfinished. But since, I bought it, I had to read it! Drat!My overall reaction to this book has more to do with my expectations not being met than with my assessment of the book. The book was better than OK but I was primed for something more radical, less liberal. So, if you are radical, I don\u2019t think you would like this book much. But if you are NOT a radical, and I guess it turns out that I might not be in this context, this book has plenty of fun if you try not to be too serious (a challenge for me). Quindlen has always been determined to research a subject and she does a good deal of that in all her books. To her credit.  I went to various journalism sites and writing style books to nail down the cutoff point for \u201celderly,\u201d the precise definition of an old person, or an older one. It seems that old is a moving target. Some gerontologists divide us into the young-old, ages fifty-five to seventh-four, and the old-old, over seventy-five. In a survey done by the Pew Research Center, most people said that old begins at sixty-eight. But most people over the age of sixty-five thought it began at seventy-five. You won\u2019t be surprised to hear that Anna Quindlen is a complex woman. And she shows her complexity in Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake. I may have misjudged her several times as I read the book. And so this review might be like a teeter-totter, up and down about her. I enjoy her writing style and her drive to research as the good journalist she is. I am distressed by her \u201cbut still\u201d (yes, there are a lot of really bad things about the Catholic church, but still\u2026) tolerance.I wind up with three stars. A strong three stars modified down to that grade by my perception that the author was not as radical as I would have liked her to be. I would have liked to have seen her take on the topic of aging from a more radical point of view."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "As a Boomer, reading Anne Quindlen\u2019s book reminds me of curling up on the living room couch with a close friend who really \u201cgets\u201d me and listening to her wry observations on life.And oh wow, DOES Quindlen ever get it! Her essays are insightful, perceptive, poignant and wise as she addresses so much of our shared Boomer experiences: marriage and kids, the importance of girlfriends, expectations and let-downs, aging and premonitions of mortality. The insights into a unique generation of women who grew up with one set of expectations and then lived through a societal bait-and-switch is often pitch perfect.

This collection of essays is described as a memoir, but is really a series of essays on what it means for a woman to turn 60 with grace. Every woman reading this, especially those of a certain age, will nod in recognition at the shared experiences physical and emotional especially when the life has been well spent. There is nothing outstanding about her, if you take her at face value. She was an extremely bright young woman who graduated from Barnard, married, had three children that she remains friends with after they've grown. She's married to the same man she met in college. But add to all that her trail breaking career with the New York Times, the fact that she departed to become a full time novelist so she could work from home, and she's won a Pulitzer. Her powers of observation are acute, the clarity of her prose, legendary. More than a little humor sprinkles her observations. When you've finished this collection yes, you feel as if you know her, but more exactly, that she knows you."}], "description": "In this irresistible memoir, the #1 New York Times bestselling author writes about her life and the lives of women today, looking back and ahead - and celebrating it all - as she considers marriage, girlfriends, our mothers, faith, loss, all that stuff in our closets, and more. It's odd when I think of the arc of my life, from child to young woman to aging adult. First I was who I was. Then I didn't know who I was. Then I invented someone, and became her. Then I began to like what I'd invented. And finally I was what I was again. It turned out I wasn't alone in that particular progression. As she did in her beloved New York Times columns, and in A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen says for us here what we may wish we could have said ourselves. Using her past, present, and future to explore what matters most to women at different ages, Quindlen talks aboutMarriage: \"A safety net of small white lies can be the bedrock of a successful marriage. You wouldn't believe how cheaply I can do a kitchen renovation.\"Girlfriends: \"Real friends offer both hard truths and soft landings and realize that it's sometimes more important to be nice than to be honest.\" Our bodies: \"I've finally recognized my body for what it is, a personality-delivery system, designed expressly to carry my character from place to place, now and in the years to come. It's like a car, and while I like a red convertible or even a Bentley as well as the next person, what I really need are four tires and an engine.\"Parenting: \"Being a parent is not transactional. We do not get what we give. It is the ultimate pay-it-forward: We are good parents, not so they will be loving enough to stay with us, but so they will be strong enough to leave us.\" From childhood memories to manic motherhood to middle age, Quindlen uses the events of her own life to illuminate our own. Along with the downsides of age, she says, can come wisdom, a perspective on life that makes it both satisfying and even joyful.
