I did...but towards the end, I began to feel a little weary. ...( only the last 10-15 pages did I finally feel...I exhausted my energy, and needed a breather). ....BOTH Michael and Pauline, were in a quandary doubting each other's intelligence decisions- financial choices - parenting-social appropriateness-anniversary celebrations- dealings with grief -loss-sex-and love.....Pauline was often erratic, having explosive outbursts, and volatile. At the same time, she took action. Looking 'put-together' and beautiful, were of some importance to her, pride in her cooking, and home-decorating skills.

For isn't this her point in so many of her novels? How different we all are and how easily we misunderstand each other? How one person can hate what another loves so passionately? How easy it is to miss the point, get the wrong end of the stick, fail to see what's under your very nose?The genius of Tyler is in her understated approach to the great themes of life. Behind the seemingly trivial details of the everyday lives of her ordinary characters, we are shown the pathos and suffering that inevitably faces us all. The passing of time. The wasted opportunities. The clarity of hindsight. Death. Loss. Regret. Disappointment. And behind all those, the persistent tug of the present and the pull of everyday concerns, and the solace that they ultimately provide.Tyler is one of the few novelists who can break your heart in a line. The closing paragraph of The Amateur Marriage had me in tears, and probably will again whenever I think of it."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "4 stars\"They were such a perfect couple. They were taking their very first steps on the amazing journey of marriage, and wonderful adventures were about to unfold in front of them.\"Wow, don't most marriages start out with this assumption!! I had to laugh to myself when I stumbled across this quote in my notes after having finished my journey with this book. And what a wild ride that was! I am honestly quite drained after reading this. I can't recall another book compelling me to scrutinize my own behaviors and my relationships so intensely as Anne Tyler's The Amateur Marriage. Michael and Pauline have a brief courtship followed by a wedding during the turbulent wartime of the 1940's. They are perhaps a classic example of \"opposites attract\". Pauline, recognizable in her \"dangerous and dramatic\" red coat, is lively, spontaneous, dramatic and unpredictable. Michael is very conventional, anti-social, rigid, and judgmental. Both appear to be passive aggressive. But, even if it's true that opposites attract, can they really survive and stay afloat for the long haul? Marriage is a lot of work and every new couple could be called \"amateurs\". But as with any relationship, marriage is one that grows over time and requires both partners to learn from one another and to compromise. Pauline and Michael seem unable to do so, and this book illustrates the damaging effects of a deficient marriage not just on the couple themselves, but their children as well. The novel spans several decades and is really a fascinating character study. Almost every person in this book will seem familiar to you \u2013 could this one or that one actually be someone you know disguised as a character within these pages? Or, worse yet, could this person be YOU? I kept asking myself these questions. Every time I sat down with this book I thought about my own actions, the actions of my spouse, my parents, my sibling, and my friends. Are my children getting the right messages from quietly observing my own behaviors and listening to each word I say? Am I doing this all wrong? I'm doing my best and I hope that's enough for now!This was my first Anne Tyler novel and I am happy to see that there are many others waiting for me. I may need to take a short break before opening another, but not because I found the story lacking. Rather, I need a bit of a rest from my own self-examination! I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading about relationships and family dynamics. There is not a lot of action here, but instead a thought-provoking and in-depth look at everyday people. \"He believed that all of them, all those young marrieds of the war years, had started out in equal ignorance. He pictured them marching down a city street, as people had on the day he enlisted. Then two by two they fell away, having grown wise and seasoned and comfortable in their roles, until only he and Pauline remained, as inexperienced as ever \u2013 the last couple left in the amateurs' parade.\""}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "\u201cI am fascinated by how families work, endurance, how do we get through life?\u201d- Anne Tyler, from an interview in The Guardian Two mismatched people \u2013 impulsive, gregarious, Wasp Pauline and methodical, quiet Polish Catholic Michael \u2013 get married, continually fight, move from one Baltimore neighbourhood to another, raise three children, experience loss and then\u2026 well, I don't want to spoil the plot, such as it is.You don\u2019t read Anne Tyler for big drama; you go to her for her vivid characters and the way she shows you people \u2013 to borrow from the quote above \u2013 \u201cgetting through life.\u201dThe Amateur Marriage spans more than half a century, with several years elapsing between each chapter. (Each chapter, shaped beautifully like a short story, is centred around a significant event: a big anniversary dinner, a lie, a reunion.) As I got further into the book and I got more invested in the characters, I found myself wondering: \u201cWhat\u2019s become of X?\u201d \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Y been mentioned in a while?\u201dBeginning a chapter, I had to brace myself in case I learned someone had died in the interim. I was eager to know how Pauline and Michael's children turned out. Were they like their mom? Their dad? After a while it felt like I knew everybody, complete with their faults \u2013 a bad temper here, a bit of coldness there \u2013 and I wanted things to turn out well for them. There's a scene with two middle-aged people on a date that had me quietly cheering them on; it's contrasted later with a date scene that had me laughing at its awkwardness.I\u2019m not sure how Tyler does this. She\u2019s great at getting us deep inside someone\u2019s point of view, but she\u2019s also a master at showing them doing things, even ordinary things. How a person drives a car says a lot about them. Following them walk up and down the aisles of a hardware store fixes them in your mind. Even the way someone sits at a table \u2013 Tyler\u2019s a cultural anthropologist in the way she depicts body language \u2013 tells you what their dialogue doesn\u2019t.Not that her dialogue is bad. Each one of her characters speaks a certain way. I adore Tyler\u2019s prose. There\u2019s nothing fashionable or faddish about it. No tricks. Just simple, old-fashioned, good writing.People complain that Tyler keeps writing the same novel. This is only the third book of hers I\u2019ve read, and yes, all three have been set in Baltimore and concern families. But in each case, she\u2019s dealing with people I know, people I\u2019ve been, people I will likely become. (Perhaps we read realistic fiction to see how other people live, to prepare us, if only subconsciously, for the future.)If Tyler writes the same novel all the time, then so did Jane Austen."}, {"userName": "Andrew Smith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith", "userReview": "Pauline and Michael meet just as America is gathering troops to help fight the Second World War. It\u2019s Baltimore in the 40\u2019s, and we are about to observe this seemingly mismatched couple (Michael quiet and \u2018straight\u2019, Pauline vivacious and wild) act out the rest of their lives.I read this book as part of a group read, so I\u2019ll not delve too deeply into what happens. But I will record a few thoughts on the experience of spending a week in the company of this duo. And let\u2019s modify that statement for a start, as we meet friends and neighbours and, of course, the wider family too along the way \u2013 it\u2019s not totally focused on Michael and Pauline.It\u2019s a gentle tale. A story of a normal marriage really. I didn\u2019t find any major twists within the pages but there were the typical ups and downs and changes we all experience in our lives. And that might just be a strength of the book: we can all find something to identify with here. But in truth I found it slow going to start with, though I did learn a few things about America in the 40\u2019s \u2013 for instance, I hadn\u2019t computed that rationing wasn\u2019t only a British thing during the war. That came as a bit of a shock! In fact, it was beyond half way before I started to build up any real empathy for the characters. I think that\u2019s because the story is told in a very matter-of-fact way; the visual picture I had developed was more documentary than dramatisation. As the characters aged I did become more engaged in their lives. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on why that was the case, but maybe it was because I suddenly had more in common with them: we were meeting the same challenges and sharing some similar views. But still the narrative seemed to be locked on this path where nothing going on in the outside world had anything but a minor role. The inverted telescope was focused on the people we\u2019d been introduced to and everything else seemed like an irrelevance that wasn\u2019t allowed to intrude.In the end I was sad to finish, as I usually am when I\u2019ve tracked peoples progress through the generations. And I\u2019ll need to take some time to really understand how I feel about this book. No doubt this will become clearer as I share more detailed thoughts with my fellow readers, but my initial reaction is one of mild disappointment that the book didn\u2019t grab me by the scruff of the neck and drag me, breathless, to the end. I\u2019m also conscious that maybe I missed something, that the essence of this book has passed me by. Time will tell \u2013 and maybe I\u2019ll come back and add some more thoughts once I\u2019ve had time to cogitate a while and to discuss my experience with others."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "Another wonderful story from Anne Tyler about a perfectly normal family, told in an anything but average way.

She certainly has her niche, but it's not cliche or dull or overwrought\u2014it's just perfectly right. I loved Michael and Pauline and hated them at the same time. I loved how each chapter jumped a bit in time so we were really able to live out this marriage with them, through it's few highs and many lows.

They were too different. He was ethnic inner city, she was of WASP heritage. Their personalities were too different. They were both stuck in adolescence, hence the amateur quality of their marriage. But for me it was Every-marriage. Of course they were of different backgrounds, with World War II acting like a giant cultural mixer. Of course they were different--opposites attract. As to adolescence, that represented where they were mired, not a personality type. (Look at our society these days, look at Congress!)Both their personalities were problematical. She was totally temperamental, he was the cold fish. The more she pursued, the more he walled himself off. She became the trouble maker of the family, the proximal flashpoint. In comparison he looked good, wore the mantle of the victim. Yet his personality was such that as a young man in basic training he was a victim of \"accidental\" friendly fire by another man whom he more than annoyed.We know what Greek tragedy is. This is American tragedy. Neither partner could decide this wasn't an amateur marriage but the real thing. Neither could take a leap of faith. For neither did a door open and reveal the way where before there seemed to be only wall. Neither could give up that the other was maliciously withholding what he/she needed.He thought the answer was a woman with a cool personality. But at the end, when she was long gone, who was it he yearned to see when he rounded the bend?This book packed a punch. Of the Anne Tyler books I've read, it was the most powerful. I read it six years ago and have never forgotten it (although some of the details have faded in the meantime). You could get PTSD from reading this book.Why read it if it is so \"traumatic?\" So it can function like Greek tragedy and exorcise the demons. Cry it out via literature and perhaps not have to suffer it in real life."}, {"userName": "Cari", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287730-cari", "userReview": "I read this book a few years ago - but it has stuck with me. The book is a portrait of a marriage between two incredibly different people. The woman is very emotional, with a flair for the dramatic. The man is very non-emotional. It paints a picture of so many marriages I have seen. I think there comes a point in marriage where a woman realizes that she married a GUY. Sounds weird to say - but there was a part of me that imagined my husband would enjoy shopping and fashion and cry at the opera, and love Jane Austin. OK, not exactly Jane Austin but ...He points at helicopters in the sky and talks about fuel pods and rotors and anti-torque propellers and ... that's just MEN. You know? And it's quite adorable, and we love them for it.I loved the characters in this book. I identified with a lot of it. It's interesting to read about how these two people and their very volatile marriage affected their children as well. It's so very plausible.

This particular one deals with Michael and Pauline who got married way too quickly. They realize through their marriage that they're incompatible, which makes this book an exploration of their life together. Each chapter skips ahead a bunch of years, and in that way we get a fast-forward, intriguing story. What I liked the most about this novel is that it challenges the romantic idea of a happy marriage. These two people can't seem to make it work simply because it went wrong from the beginning, and naturally you can't help imagining what their lives would have been like if they had chosen a different destiny. In many ways, this novel reminded me of \"Fates & Furies\" by Lauren Groff which I read last year and equally loved. It's an honest, however brutal love story, and it's one of those books that make you think about life in general and the choices we make."}, {"userName": "Bill Khaemba", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41380936-bill-khaemba", "userReview": "\u201c\nHe wished he had inhabited more of his life, used it better, filled it fuller.\u201d\nAs the title suggests this was an exploration of how not everyone is an expert at companionship/marriage.

She has this ability to showcase complex characters in very complex relationships especially in this book. She paired two very different individuals An extroverted over the top Woman with a reserved Introverted man and spending each chapter in both their minds, we get to see how the lack of communication destroys their union.I enjoyed this one I found myself caring for them and constantly shouting at them to treat each other well and the whole generational transition was fascinating plus I genuinely enjoy Anne Tyler's writing she really knows how to structure dialogue, I can always hear the characters voices.I just wish this featured a more diverse range of characters because it felt to \"suburban\" for my taste & that lessened the emotional impact. Another thing about Anne Tyler is that all her books are set in Baltimore so I tend to separate my time between each of her books or they become too similar.Regardless, She still makes the reading experience feel like you are sitting at a dinner table with a f*cked up family (pardon my french) I recommend her books if you are remotely interested."}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1391890-philip", "userReview": "Lives In TimeFor me, The Amateur Marriage represents the sixth time I have read one of Anne Tyler\u2019s novels. On the surface it\u2019s the story of Michael and Pauline. They meet by chance in 1941 in Anton\u2019s, the grocery store run by Michael\u2019s family. 1941, perhaps incidentally, is the year Anne Tyler was born.There was a war to be fought, of course, a war that affected both of their lives. But there\u2019s a marriage, and a child, a daughter named Lindy. Others follow, a boy and another girl. For Michael and Pauline, life progresses, as does their marriage. But twists and turns take them to places they have never visited.As with other novels by Anne Tyler, there is an obvious and consistent linearity about its time. A reviewer has to be careful with detail, because what happens to this novel\u2019s characters is a large part of how it happens, and thus an integral part of the book\u2019s rationale. To some extent, a listing of the plot, event by event, would render a reading unnecessary. But after a handful of Anne Tyler\u2019s books, I am now convinced there is much more going on in them than mere story-telling.In the past I have found her characters shallow, rather self-obsessed, selfish, perhaps. They are people who have lives outside the family, but people who seem pre-occupied with the familiar and seem rarely to confront ideas or experience outside its apparently defining, but only sometimes reassuring confines.And perhaps that\u2019s the point. It is an American dream, a libertarian ideal under a microscope. It is analysed, picked apart, sometimes reconstructed. The characters are affected by political, social, economic and cultural change. Their lives are materially transformed by the same forces that lay waste and occasionally reinvent their home town, Baltimore. But they, themselves, are mere recipients of these effects, appearing to play no part in their instigation or, it seems, their analysis. They live their lives. They are pushed around by experience, jostled by life, reflect little, internalise everything, only occasionally recognising life\u2019s potential to reform. Time thus moves on. Inevitability looms unexpectedly.It is not a criticism of Anne Tyler, her novel or its characters to proffer the opinion that everything seems to happen in an intellectual wasteland. People go to college, do law degrees, become involved with good causes, procreate, but moments of reflection seem to be confined to what breed of dog might not provoke allergy. Perhaps that\u2019s the point. Such things are the stuff of life.

A marriage that should never have happened but lasts for 30 years. This is an exploration of complex relationships that fascinate from start to finish. Tyler is so good at these sweeping novels that span generations and are as fresh today as the day they were written. Her characters are so fully rounded and we can recognise them immediately in our own lives. This is a story not only of a marriage but of a time in history (from before WW2 onwards) and of a family that grows up before us, with such detail that you feel you really know them.

The book consists of watching their unhealthy, selfish, pathetic relationship from beginning to end. Neither of them is likable.

All her characters are so whole and authentic that as I read I keep thinking, \"I know this person\" or \"OMG, that is me\". That is Tyler, in general, now for this novel specifically. Pauline and Michael (the members of the aforesaid amateur marriage) are two very flawed opposites, entangled in a death-grip and unable to communicate on any meaningful level. They cannot be happy together, but they are afraid that they will not be able to be happy apart. At some point I decided that what binds them to one another is the convenience of having someone to blame for their own shortcomings.Underneath some rank hostility, unbelievable indifference to the other's feelings, and insurmountable differences, there is a current of honest affection that persists to the last page of the book. They have had an amateur marriage because they enter into it without any idea of what they are really committing to and they never crack the secret code that might have made it a happy one. Still, I couldn't help asking myself, aren't all marriages amateur. Who knows what they will encounter, how they will deal with each other's quirks and needs, if they can juggle the responsibilities of aging parents and children and living in a house with intimates who sometimes feel like strangers.

This isn't my typical read, but I was intrigued by the book's description. It focuses on three generations of a family and the impacts of a marriage on all of them. My biggest struggle was that the main characters, Michael and Pauline, were very hard to like and frustrated me beyond belief. I appreciated that Tyler did an excellent job in writing such flawed characters, but it was very challenging for me to read. Their life choices and its ramifications were depressing. I found myself disliking Pauline all together. As a woman, I was horrified by her decisions and overall approach to life; I wasn't able to relate to her in any way. I felt a small level of empathy for Michael, but I wasn't attached enough to his character to develop more.To me this book was a snapshot of specific moments in the lives of the couple, their children, and grandchildren. It focused on specific moments in their lives and the impact of seemingly small decisions, which over the course of the book the reader was able to see the ramifications.I did enjoy that the 10 chapters each had a specific chapter name that was referenced in some way during that section. I also liked that the chapters alternated between various family members' perspectives while still telling a cohesive story. At times, I was shocked by how many years passed in between the end of one chapter and the start of another.

It was true to life, with hapiness and disappointment. Plus, it helped me see that even if you aren't a perfect match, kindness, understanding, and forgiveness go a long way in making a marriage happy."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBc Radio 4 - 15 Minute drama:By Anne Tyler dramatised by Rebecca Lenkiewicz.Episode one - 1941, Iodine and BandagesAn unexpected romantic encounter over first aid between Michael and Pauline is the beginning of this story of a turbulent partnership.Director: David Hunter.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08lglt3"}, {"userName": "Evie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70046-evie", "userReview": "AFter I read The Accidental Tourist, I went back on Amazon and bought this and Back When We Were Grownups.I love how Tyler masks tension the characters are experiencing internally and in their relationships with descriptions of the banal. You just know someone is going to blow a gasket at any moment, but she makes the characters and the reader simmer in it, turning up the heat slowly with the passing years, seemingly meaningless squabbles, and resignation. Pauline and Michael are just wrong for each other, but out of duty, expectations, or simply the era in which they were raised, they end up spending a good chunk of their lives married--not exactly miserable, but definitely not happy--to each other. You want to shake one or both of them to wake them up so they can spare each other more useless years boredom and pain. You want to yell, \"Do something, PLEASE!\" In the meantime, the children absorb all the parental drama--all the \"what ifs\", denied wishes, resentment--and end up (one of them at least) adding more stress to the marriage. Finally, one of the parents ends up leaving, but I don't feel that that character is any more happy than when married to the original partner. So what is the point? I think both are looking for something they couldn't have possibly found in each other or maybe even in another partner. Neither of them seem to get this by the end of the book, but that's what the kids will end up working out on their own with a shrink!"}, {"userName": "Cristina", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/281894-cristina", "userReview": "What I take from this book from a craft perspective is a lesson in writing sparingly. While the story spans nearly a lifetime, as Tyler looks at the marriage of two people, each life chapter is chosen, as if they were stories in and of themselves, stories that connect to create a bigger picture. In other words, she doesn't explain everything. We get glimpses, almost flashes, like we are looking at slides in a projector, of the chapters in the life and death of this marriage.When I first began reading this, I thought I might not like the characters, and there is definitely an element of that, but Tyler is necessarily unapologetic. This is another lesson I come away. There is no explanation of everything. There is no apologizing for anything. This is a marriage, for better or worse, and Tyler hits at the core of that to be sure. As a writer of fiction, I found it a great lesson in how to make a \"lifespan\" story move and at the same time not get bogged down in the unnecessary explanation of things. At the same time, we really do get to know and understand these characters. So, less is truly more when exploring a story that traverses so much time."}, {"userName": "Jenni", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1851766-jenni", "userReview": "This book was recommended to me by a Christian woman who said that it taught her a lot about her own marriage. Perhaps it's not my place to judge, but I walked away from this book thinking that its message was one of anti-marriage or at least one of not getting married too young. Well, I myself was a very young bride--22 and I'll be the first to tell you marriage is work, very hard work and this book was kind of a slap in the face in a way. I HATED the characters and the fact that they were so immature, nasty, and hateful to each other which happens a lot in many marriages. I guess I did walk away thinking about how easy it is to hurt the person you love the most. That's exactly what happened in this book...they are awful to each other! I think the message you can take away from this book is that marriage isn't for amateurs and it made my stomach churn because our society so readily accepts divorce which I think gives everyone a huge cop out. Don't get married if you aren't prepared to make sacrifices and be selfless!!"}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1424859-bonnie", "userReview": "Since this was written after her husband died, I thought perhaps it may have been partly autobiographical.

Review coming soon.See my review and others here: http://onceuponatime-bookblog.blogspo...This is the first book that I have read by Anne Tyler. It is a wonderful and compelling novel about the marriage gone horribly wrong of two people and the effects that it has across three generations. Michael and Pauline are young when they meet at Michael's mother's grocery store in the early 1940s. Michael is smitten at first site, but from the beginning, it is evident that the two are not well-suited to be together. They have a short courtship before rushing off to a hasty marriage due to Michael returning from the war.Throughout the next sixty years, Michael and Pauline suffer through an unhappy marriage. They are both relatively decent people, but they just don't work well together. Each chapter focuses on a short time in their lives and is filled with rich detail and insight into themselves and their relationship. As the years pass, we also get a glimpse at how their actions effect their children and grandchildren.I thought this book was extremely well-written and did a great job of writing about realistic characters and realistic situations throughout an ordinary life. It wasn't all that fun to read and was actually pretty depressing, but that wasn't what the book was about. It was heartbreaking to read at times, but was able to cause the reader to relate to each of the characters in different ways. I loved the descriptions of the time periods and way of life during different time periods. The vivid detail works well with the chapters. The book spans many decades, but does so in a way that readers don't see the character throughout every event in their lives and instead focuses on specific periods with long gaps in between. I really thought that this worked well in this book and it is one that I will remember for a long time. I will definitely be looking at more books by this author.I read this book as a buddy reads on goodreads.com for the month of March with some fellow goodreads members. It was a great discussion book for us!!

Now, with \"The Amateur Marriage,\" the bittersweet perception that infused her earlier work is so attenuated that only the most faithful fans will be able to taste it.Knopf is planning an enormous 300,000 copy first printing - something like opening a movie in 4,000 theaters - but \"The Amateur Marriage\" shouldn't be anyone's first experience with Tyler's work. It has to be enjoyed in the nostalgic glow of older classics like \"St. Maybe,\" \"The Accidental Tourist,\" and \"Breathing Lessons.\" Indeed, the novel's elliptical structure encourages readers to fill in important scenes themselves, preferably by remembering how gracefully Tyler used to do that heavy lifting for us.The story opens with one of those legendary encounters that sets a dozen lives in new directions. The Japanese have just bombed Pearl Harbor, and the streets of this Polish neighborhood in Baltimore are filled with young men eager to enlist, when a group of girls brings Pauline into Mrs. Anton's little grocery store for a bandage. In that moment, her son, Michael, is smitten.Tyler displays all her usual skill with the tragic comedy of this relationship. Pauline's control over her bland, young boyfriend is complicated by Michael's slavish devotion to his charm-free mother. He can't tell her that he and Pauline are dating, or that Pauline has motivated him to enlist, or that they're getting married. But Pauline can tell everyone everything. \"Pauline felt entitled to spill anything that came into her head while Michael measured out every word. She was brimming with energy - a floor-pacer, a foot-jiggler, a finger-drummer - while he was slow and plodding and secretly somewhat lazy.\"From the start, their romance is pocked with bitter quarrels \"that simply materialized, developing less from something they said than from who they were, by nature.\" Pauline's anger blows up frequently, but in the process blows away. Michael, on the other hand, clutches his wrath to him and nurses it till it grows to lethal intensity. Soon Michael is asking himself, \"Was it possible to dislike your own wife?\" And Pauline is wondering if \"all wives believe they had chosen the wrong course.\"So, to review, she's the passionate wife who wants to talk about her feelings, and he's the quiet husband who keeps his emotions bottled up, and together they move through a series of arguments lifted from a cover story in Redbook magazine.Yes, that's unfair: A story about good friends who \"never should have married each other\" can have value no matter how common that situation is, and surely \"The Amateur Marriage\" sometimes produces intimate touches of personal agony as light and indelible as smoke. But too often, it fails to rise above the stereotypes that inform its premise, and the whole thing trudges along, without even the usual touches of quirkiness that individualize the families in Tyler's best fiction.This problem grows more pressing in subsequent chapters. Pauline and Michael raise three unhappy children in the '60s. Two of them try to maintain peace in the family; the third one rebels against her parents' uptight, suburban culture.Pauline and Michael \"didn't know what to do. They felt they were in way over their heads.\" So, they blame each other. \"There's no need for melodrama,\" he tells her. \"Well, at least I'm not a block of wood, like some others I could name,\" Pauline responds. And then Tyler writes, \"And so on, and so on, and so on,\" as though to admit that she finds all this just as thread worn as we do.Unfortunately, the book's structure, the way it jumps over complicated years of development in these characters' lives, leaves us with a lot of \"and so on, and so on, and so on.\" The night of their 30th wedding anniversary, for instance, Michael sums up the missing years in a way that flattens them into sitcom clich\u00e9s: \"All this shouting and weeping and carrying on, stalking off, slamming doors, kicking furniture, throwing my clothes out the window, locking me out of the house....\" After another eight-year jump, Tyler brings us up to speed by telling us that life is \"preferable to how it used to be, of course (the tears and recriminations, the clatter of slammed-down receivers).\" This is storytelling by number.Fuming alone one night, rehearsing Michael's flaws, Pauline thinks that \"she could read him like a book.\" But that's the problem: We all can, and it's a book we've read many times before.http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0106/p1..."}, {"userName": "Sarah Obsesses over Books & Cookies", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2070861-sarah-obsesses-over-books-cookies", "userReview": "I really thought they'd stay together because it's what I've experienced with AT so far. But no they didn't. I finished this book a week ago and forgot to post it. Anyway, Michael and Pauline met and because of their situations and personalities they just stayed together. You could tell they didn't really get along but they stayed, as many people do. He went to war, enlisted because Pauline was so enthusiastic about it but then he gets injured (not in battle, just in stupidity) and was sent home. They have three kids and one day on their anniversary they have another one of their petty fights and he points out how unhappy he is and she's like well if you're so unhappy then get out! and he does. She exhibits all the emotions I can relate to as for being in a relationship that is real. Like, feeling angry and not expressing it right and then wanting to be approached but not say it. Pauline seems to have been an irritable person and Michael is a guy who's kind of a pushover. He lived with his mother for a long time and she ruled his life and then she died and then his wife sort of ruled it. But then they divorce and you're left feeling like.. now what? but we follow Michael as he embarks on another relationship and we never quite hear what Pauline thinks of it, especially since it was an old friend of hers. And we learn a little about the kids and how they feel about their parent's marriage and divorce and how they have their own issues. I loved it. I'm trying to get away from Anne Tyler but that's like trying to give up chocolate ice cream every night. It sounds like a good idea but we both know i'm not going to do it."}], "description": "From the inimitable Anne Tyler, a rich and compelling novel about a mismatched marriage--and its consequences, spanning three generations. They seemed like the perfect couple--young, good-looking, made for each other. The moment Pauline, a stranger to the Polish Eastern Avenue neighborhood of Baltimore (though she lived only twenty minutes away), walked into his mother's grocery store, Michael was smitten. And in the heat of World War II fervor, they are propelled into a hasty wedding. But they never should have married. Pauline, impulsive, impractical, tumbles hit-or-miss through life; Michael, plodding, cautious, judgmental, proceeds deliberately. While other young marrieds, equally ignorant at the start, seemed to grow more seasoned, Pauline and Michael remain amateurs. In time their foolish quarrels take their toll. Even when they find themselves, almost thirty years later, loving, instant parents to a little grandson named Pagan, whom they rescue from Haight-Ashbury, they still cannot bridge their deep-rooted differences. Flighty Pauline clings to the notion that the rifts can always be patched. To the unyielding Michael, they become unbearable. From the sound of the cash register in the old grocery to the counterculture jargon of the sixties, from the miniskirts to the multilayered apparel of later years, Anne Tyler captures the evocative nuances of everyday life during these decades with such telling precision that every page brings smiles of recognition. Throughout, as each of the competing voices bears witness, we are drawn ever more fully into the complex entanglements of family life in this wise, embracing, and deeply perceptive novel. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"", "title": "The Amateur Marriage", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2435003.The_Amateur_Marriage", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436261299l/2435003.jpg", "reviews": 1139, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/457.Anne_Tyler", "name": "Anne Tyler"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2435003.The_Amateur_Marriage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15764.The_Amateur_Marriage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/581363.The_Amateur_Marriage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/852947.The_Amateur_Marriage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24912796-im-krieg-und-in-der-liebe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6653670-the-amateur-marriage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60792.The_Accidental_Tourist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22501028-a-spool-of-blue-thread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77699.Dinner_at_the_Homesick_Restaurant", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31181.Breathing_Lessons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/698.Digging_to_America"]}
