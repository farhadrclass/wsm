It has been quite a long time since I read anything by her, but she has kept to a similar formula \u2013 taking a historical character and then writing their life, usually from the first person perspective. Often the people she writes about have stories that are very well known, but she incorporates such detail in the re-telling, that you really do have the sensation of a life lived. Obviously, this is fiction and putting thoughts into a real person\u2019s mind, however long ago they lived, is a difficult thing to do. However, it is obvious that the author does a huge amount of research and this is reflected in the care she takes to tell the story thoroughly. However, this is not a dry re-telling, but George really does attempt to breathe life into the characters and to make the era they lived in also feel realistic. I must admit that Nero is somebody I knew a fairly small amount about, especially compared to other Roman Emperor\u2019s. There are all sorts of images that you think of \u2013 probably for many of us, it is that of Peter Ustinov playing music while Rome was in flames (the image of Nero fiddling while Rome burnt is similar to that of Marie Antoinette telling people to eat cake, in that it becomes so associated with them that it is hard to separate fact from fiction). In this book, George takes Nero back to the four year old Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, whose mother has been exiled, his father dead, and who is, literally when we first meet him, at the mercy of his Uncle Caligula. This early exposure to the whims of a Caesar give the young Nero a forbidding view of his future. He is privy to early, huddled, secretive meetings by relatives about ridding themselves of Caligula and, when this comes to pass, he finds himself swooped up by his mother, Agrippina, and taken to Rome. Claudius is now Emperor, but life is still not safe, and never will be. Nero is fairly young when he realises that he has the, \u201cblood of murderers coursing through him,\u201d and that his early witness to violence and politics are deeply embedded in his life, whether he likes it or not. There is plenty here about Nero\u2019s love of music, theatre and games, which people associate with him. His desire to have someone to trust that he can cling to, but the knowledge that his ancestors loom over his life and give it a direction as part of the most powerful Julio-Claudian dynasty. This is a tale of Ancient Rome which has everything you would expect \u2013 threats of death, poison, seduction, murder, power, politics and the man chosen to be the heir of Claudius, who needs to be ever watchful, suspicious and unsure who he can trust. This is an entertaining historical novel and an enjoyable addition to Margaret George\u2019s series of fictional biographies.

I love the way she chooses figures from history that are maligned or controversial. George now tackles Ancient Rome and the early life of the legendary Emperor Nero. From being nearly drowned by his uncle, Caligula, to his volatile relationship with his mother Agrippina, his marriage to Poppaea, Rome's battle with Queen Boudicca, his meeting with the Apostle Paul, and the burning of Rome, readers are swept back into history and given a front row seat.Beyond Nero's political dealings, George delves into Nero's personal side as well. His love of the arts and music, and his inner turmoil of being an Emperor and the nefarious things he had to do along the way. George paints Nero as a flawed man, but one that knows he is flawed.I look forward to George continuing Nero's story in her next novel, which she is currently working on now. I remember hearing somewhere that she is also thinking of writing a book on Queen Boudicca and I sincerely hope that she does. I wanted to hear more about Boudicca's battle with Rome.I highly recommend you checking out The Confessions of Young Nero, it's a fascinating look at a real, yet flawed, Emperor Nero!

With few unbiased sources of research, as Nero's name was blackened thoroughly by his successors after his demise, she recreates with sympathy and wit the uncertain boy dominated by the ambitions of his lethal mother, his dangerous interactions with the elite of Rome, his yearning to become an accomplished musician / artist in his own right, and his inevitable, if at times unwilling, path toward absolute power. While Nero is depicted in all his strength, his fallibility gets equal page time; he can come across as almost pathetic as he insists on his artistic ventures while Rome seethes, plots, and eliminates rivals on a whim. But his relationship with his mother, Agrippina, sheds cruel light on a young mind warped by a woman whose moral compass is as single-minded as it is twisted. Though we see less of her than we might prefer, to Nero's relief, whenever she hits the scene, you're riveted. Agrippina is the serpent in Nero's heart, and we just know that no matter how he might escape her physically, he'll never escape her emotionally. She leaves her brand on him as only a mother can.The first in a two-book series on Nero, the book ends as he solidifies his power over Rome. Through his eyes, we experience not only his awakening to who he is and what he must do to survive, but we walk the crowded streets of Rome, the airy palaces with their taint of blood, and sniff goblets that might be tainted with poison and spell our death. Ms George never falters in her clarity of intent to rescue Nero from the calumny that submerged him, without descending to maudlin justifications, and I, for one, can't wait to see him in his full glory in the next installment."}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "This book = THE ME I\u2019M TRYNA BE IN 2017.Guys, I have a huge favor to ask you.

All it needed was a compelling storyteller to add his voice to the tale.This is part one of two, beginning with his early life on the outskirts of power right to the heart of it as Emperor. Margaret George cleverly evokes our sympathy for a young man caught up in the unpredictable, perilous family politics of Rome, with poison and plots, schemes and sex. Amidst this, Nero is shown as clever and capable, doing what he can to ride the waves of luck or misfortune which come his way, far from being a master of his destiny. And yet, there are signs, little hints of what is to come as he grows older, as he starts to take control of people and events. The author never lets us lose that first impression while she slowly illuminates the darker side of his character. Before you know it, your thoughts are so conflicted they make no sense, and any history buff will know there's worse to come. It very much reminded me of the progression of Walter White in Breaking Bad, except I knew where this one was going.Character isn't the only thing Margaret George gets right. The art with historical fiction, and particularly that set in ancient Greece or Rome, is incorporating current culture and the detail of daily lives into the background without making it as jarring as a broken, buzzing, flashing neon sign. Something that shouts: look at me, this is my research, I KNOW things. Not only does she manage to make this information illustrative without being ostentatious, she shows us the ideas prevalent at the time: prejudices against Greek culture, the role of slaves or the 'lower people' of Rome, attitudes about family and marriage, the force exerted by the past on the present... It all adds depth and veracity to the story.Most definitely an author I should have picked up before now, I'll be moving on to The Memoirs of Cleopatra next.ARC via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "I managed 200 pages of this book and then gave up.

I would prefer to read a history book about Nero rather than this mix of fact and imagined conversations and feelings. I also thought that the author made a poor decision to have this story told in the first person by Nero (initially as a 4 year old) rather than in the third person.

When you hear the name Nero, you think of the late great Peter Ustinov\u2019s performance in the movie Quo Vadis. If you do not know what I am referring to, check out IMDB. The common view of Nero is he was (in no particular order) a madman, a murderer, a incestuous son, the persecutor of Christians, a third rate artist and a lousy husband. That image of Nero is exactly why Margaret George has written The Confessions of Young Nero. Ms. George states in her Afterward that she was \u201cdrawn to him as I sensed the vast gap between the perception of him and what he really was.\u201d I am glad to wrote this book as it addressed the myth and the man.I have read several of Ms. George\u2019s previous books. One of my biggest personal library losses is the disappearance of my hardback copy of The Autobiography of Henry VIII (1986) somewhere in the last two moves since 1988. She is a very talented writer who uses hard research as the skeleton she fleshes out in her historical fiction. The Afterward of this book explains in detail how Nero\u2019s reputation was sabotaged and how she worked through many sources to find unbiased resources. The book begins when Nero is three years old and his uncle Caligula tries to drown him. Great trust building exercise. The majority of the chapters are narrated by Nero. There are occasionally other narrators, such as his mother Agrippina, Locusta (the premier poisoner of Rome), and Acte, the freedwoman who loved him. These short changes of perspective help pull all the different strands of the story together. It is a complex story. Anything that deals with the Roman Empire is complex. George\u2019s Nero is not the full grown ruler of the largest empire in the world. He is a small child, raised by Greek slaves and freedmen. He is a child who comes to loved his step-father and watches as his mother destroys him to satisfy her own ambition. He is helpless and a pawn in the larger schemes of others. As he comes to terms with his mother\u2019s ambitions of him, he still strives to be the best of what his step-father\u2019s hopes for him were. Nero\u2019s slide from the his good intentions to his heavy handed rule is well documented. This is where George\u2019s genius shines. She creates a full story, complete characters and believable environments. She is historical fiction at it\u2019s best. This is the first part of a two part novel, the first time George has done this.

It's a fairy sizeable book (around 600 pages, I believe) - but I was thoroughly hooked throughout. The story follows Nero - initially as a young boy called Lucius, raised by his Aunt. We follow his exploits as he meets his mother again, rises to become the adopted son of a Caesar, then finally takes the title for himself. The story ends on something of a cliffhanger, as the emperor who 'fiddled' races towards a burning Rome...There's so much to praise about this book. Firstly - the depiction of Nero himself. If ever there was a maligned Roman Caesar, it's this guy. History has written him off as a madman, content to play his instrument whilst his city burned beneath him - a pleasure-seeker with no interest beyond his own carnal desires. Of course, as we all know, history has a habit of being rather biased, and the author's assumption that this is the case with Nero probably isn't far off the mark.The Nero in this book is sensitive, thoughtful - and a true artist, who feels constrained by his elevated role. The author doesn't shy away from his various misdeeds (e.g. murdering his own mother!) but rather seeks to explore possible motive, rather than simply making him out to be insane / evil. The supporting characters are likewise compelling. Locasta the poisoner was a real favourite (I kept expecting to see her return at the end, as she's so integral throughout!), and wise, rational Seneca. The author was also exceptionally adept at imagining what it would actually be like to be Caesar - yes, the wealth, the privilege, the luxury - but also the restrictions, the sycophancy and the fear of others plotting against you. Overall, masterfully done - I'll be keeping an eye out for other books by Margaret George, that's for sure!"}, {"userName": "Teddy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271544-teddy", "userReview": "In the Roman Empire, after the rein of Julius Caesar, Ner\u014d Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus was born.

Historical fiction lovers know that when you read a book by Margaret George, you're in for real treat. This book is definitely no different! I enjoyed this story and was very excited to see that this is only George's first book in a planned series on Nero.In this book, George takes us back to ancient Rome, to when Nero the infamous Emperor is still a young boy. Even though he's very young in this book, he is still involved with some of the palace intrigue that seems to go along with being in ancient Rome. Not only is Nero fascinating but some of the secondary characters really add to the book. His mother is bent on ensuring that he will one day become emperor and that she will reap the benefits of his power. She is definitely an interesting character and one that I would want to stay far, far away from her in real life as she seems to have a tendency to get upset when things don't go her way and try to poison people. There is poison and plots galore throughout this book.This book covers from when Nero was a young boy to when he becomes Emperor and the few years after that. This book is supposed to be the first in a duology or series from George on Nero. One thing that I really like that George does with this book is she is able to humanize and give good insight into Nero. Being a history lover, I had heard a lot of things about Nero. You hear all sorts of stories about the kind of person that he was (not usually positive) and George gives him some humanity and somewhat of a explanation as to why he was the way that he was. The detail in the story is a true treat! As with George's other books she spends a lot of time coming up with the great detail in order to give the reader a full body experience when reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed this book but I'm kind of sad but I've already read it and now have to wait for its companion. The wait will be well worth it as I am excited to finish this great story!"}, {"userName": "Caidyn (BW Book Reviews; he/him/his)", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-bw-book-reviews-he-him-his", "userReview": "This review and others can be found on BW Book Reviews.4.5/5Margaret George is an author I've been meaning to read for years now. I own her famous books about Cleopatra and Henry VIII. I'm pretty sure that I also own her book on Mary, Queen of Scots. However, her books are so long that I don't have time to read them since I'm in my last year as an undergraduate. Reading for pleasure is a distant dream in my life. My saving grace is where I work; a warehouse that just allows me to listen to stuff all the time, so I listen to books. Basically, for a book that's about 500 pages, it's optimal for me to listen.George doesn't disappoint in her epic about Nero. She's pretty well known for taking historical figures who have been slandered for whatever reason, then twisting the known facts in a way to make it them shine. This story starts in about 41CE and spans until 64CE. Basically from Nero being four to being twenty-three. It's an epic in proportion, honestly. George handles all of the information evenly with good pacing. Nothing felt too slow or too fast.Now, usually with historical fiction, I'll go off and rant about historical accuracy. However, I don't know much about Ancient Rome. My area was Ancient Egypt, mainly about Cleopatra. I know enough Roman history to get by. Everything I know about Nero is negative. He was frivolous, artsy, not fit to be Emperor. He fiddled as Rome burned. Not a good guy. George took that information then showed that he was good. She never disputed the bad things that he did do but put them into some perspective. That takes a talented author, honestly. Her afterward went through why she made these assumptions, logically telling you why.There are only two things I want to critique about this book. The first is the length. As I said, it's great with pacing. For how much information this book covered, it had amazing pacing. George didn't leave anything out. Every so often, I'd check on Wikipedia about something to find that it happened or there were rumors of it happening. Some things I felt could have gotten left out. Just too repetitive and accomplished nothing. Same with the reiterations of parallels between Nero, Paris, and Apollo.The second thing is the multiple POVs. Nero is the main POV. Then, there are two others. Locusta, a poisoner that he runs into multiple times, and Acti, a servant who is devoted to Nero despite ties to others. Both of those POVs added nothing to the story. It felt like it was showing over telling me what was going on. There were other ways to inject what they said and suddenly switching POVs for a chapter that were barely pages long, it just didn't make any sense to keep it.Because I enjoyed this book so much, I'm totally looking forward to the sequel to this book so I know how it ends, and I'll have to try carving out time to read George's books that I actually own."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise", "userReview": "Margaret George\u2019s interpretation of Nero defies the stereotypes that come not only from Hollywood in our own times but also in some of the surviving ancient histories. She sees him gifted in poetry, music and athletics, caring for his subjects and preferring diplomacy over war.Most of the book \u201cis written by Nero\u201d; there are a few chapters by Locusta (a poisoner) and Acte (his first love). \u201cYoung Nero\u201d basically renounces his family\u2019s murderous past. He attempts to steer clear of it until he realizes he may be killed by his own mother and survival kicks in. The character of (his mother) Agrippina is particularly well drawn by the conversations and events showing her conniving. Nero gives his thought process as he plans his counter measures. There is an interesting scene with Paul of Tarsus. Nero (reputed outside this book to persecute Christians), gives him his freedom which offends his wife Poppacae a supporter of the Jews. In the end Nero is performing on the cithara (a stringed instrument) while, unbeknownst to him, Rome is on fire.George\u2019s Henry VIII and Elizabeth I books were better reads for me, but it could be that I know Tudor lives well enough to appreciate the rendering and the irony and this is not so with Nero. It could also be that Tudor England is, simply, richer material for this style of novel.While it gets a bit wordy in between the action scenes this is a good read. A follow up volume for Nero\u2019s later life is in the works. I will surely look for it.

George's take is not as sensationalist as some might have preferred, but instead, envisions the life of Nero beginning with his earliest days, long before he had any thought of being the leader of the Roman Empire. The historical details are so tightly woven into the heart of the story that as a reader you are immediately swept into the center of what could feel like a foreign world but instead unfolds in a tableau easily rendered in the mind's eye. It is impossible to truly know what Nero was like based on the few texts of his life and legacy, which are most certainly somewhat distorted by politics and the passing of time. Perhaps he was as horrible as our collective cultural imagination deems him. But what if he wasn't?

I have been interested in the life of Emperor Nero since I learned about him in Mr. Felt's 7th grade history class. According to the three surviving historical reports written about Nero, he sounded like a completely crazy person. He was Rome's youngest Emperor (only 16), and his inexperience led to disasters. He despised and persecuted Christians, he forced admittance into the Olympics and then insisted on winning, though he was wonderfully overweight, he commissioned a 100 foot bronze statue to be built in his likeness, and lived especially lavishly. He poisoned his adopted brother Brittanicus, who was the rightful heir to the empire; he ordered Seneca, the Roman philosopher and his tutor, to commit suicide; he killed his first wife, Octavia, after he wrongly accused her of infertility and infidelity so he could marry his second wife; he killed his second wife, Poppaea Sabina, by kicking her while she was pregnant during an argument; he killed the husband of his third wife so he could marry her; then he reportedly castrated and married a manservant that looked a bit like Poppaea, his second wife. He also made several attempts on his mother's life, including a collapsing ceiling above her bed (didn't work), several poisoning attempts (she took antidotes), and finally putting her on an elaborate boat that was actually built to sink (she simply swam ashore), and then he just finally had her assassinated. He also had himself killed when he heard of an assassination plot that was likely only a rumor. He ordered his private secretary to kill him before others could. His mother was probably even worse than Nero. She was reported to have poisoned or killed at least 10 people that we know of, including two of her husbands, once of which was Emperor Claudius (her biological uncle, no less), whom she had poisoned so that Nero could be Emperor. She was accused of incest with several family members, including Nero himself. In short, the Romans were NUTS. But Margaret George is a Nero sympathizer and writes a book from Nero's perspective, obviously trying to redeem him a bit. She paints Nero as an impressionable boy with an insane mother, and put his wacky decisions in a very forgiving light. She denies many of the ancient roman records and reports a different Nero entirely. I understand her trying to analyze the historical records, and agree that there is likely some lies mixed with truth, but I don't think he could have been even remotely as wonderful as she makes him out to be. Because this is a novel, she takes many liberties with the dialogue and assigns many motives that she could not know, like when he released the apostle Paul. George makes Nero seem like a fan of Paul, and he chooses the release Paul because he was being unjustly held. While Paul's imprisonment was unjust, it does not explain why Nero not only eventually had Paul beheaded, but also had Peter crucified. He hated the Christians and trying to pretend otherwise is ridiculous.I enjoyed learning more about the historical context of Nero's story, but I really disliked her historical rewrite. Perhaps Nero was not as evil as historians made him out to be, but he was not a good man, as George would have her audience believe. Also, Ancient Rome was INSANE."}, {"userName": "Erika Robuck", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103117-erika-robuck", "userReview": "Contemporary politics looks like child\u2019s play compared to that of Ancient Rome.The Confessions of Young Nero, by Margaret George, is a 506-page epic novel, and likely the first in a series. In truth, I couldn\u2019t imagine enjoying a novel about a man like Nero. Saints Peter and Paul were executed under his rule, and the myths and rumors of Nero\u2019s scandalous lifestyle hardly make him a sympathetic figure. Imagine my surprise when I not only could not put the book down, but was even able to comprehend how a childhood rife with assassination attempts, poisoning of loved ones, and a mother who preyed upon and used her son for political ascendancy could have produced such a man.One of my college history professors once told her class that she could never understand why anyone thought history was boring; it was all sex and violence. Margaret George reinforces that fact in The Confessions of Young Nero. Ancient Rome, its provinces, and its people are vividly rendered in all their glory, and the plotting, scheming, successes and failures of the imperial dynasty are clear and readable. It is a true testament to George\u2019s writing that the reader will find herself not only rooting for unsavory outcomes to benefit young Nero, but will also be moved by his challenges and triumphs.Fans of Philippa Gregory and Diana Gabaldon will love The Confessions of Young Nero.

But patience during the early pages was worth it because I felt I was able to really know the Nero of this story and truly feel sympathy for the character.The author argues in her notes that the Nero we are familiar with is the one told from the perspective of only three of the myriad historians and others painted him and his actions quite differently. I would suppose this is true to I was willing to be persuaded to put a more positive spin on many of his actions, though that said, this Nero was no saintly innocent, but could get as dark and brutal as any in his family tree when he felt threatened or there was something he really wanted.The Confessions of Young Nero begin when he is a very small child and carry through to his time as Roman emperor. He has known what it is to be in danger of his life as a child and to see his mother ruthlessly clear the way for his rise. As a teen, he is married to his cousin and also step-sister since his mother married her own uncle, Emperor Claudius. Then he falls for a freed Greek woman and they share a special love all in secret. As long as there are other family descendants and his manipulating mother is around, Nero cannot be safe so he does something about it. Ruthlessly. Nero is taken with the arts of music and drama and with Greek sports and chariot racing, but what he is not taken with is making war. Much of his life, Roman is at peace, but Nero faced war in Britain with Queen Boudicca and helped gain peace in the east with Parthia. During this time, he falls in love again and it is deeply with his friend's wife who is willing to divorce Otho to have Nero. Nero uses his power to divorce his wife and have his Poppinaea. So, this was a long one and it begins with Nero's family history and situation. I was a little lost amongst all the names and past situations that were mentioned. Then I settled when it moved forward with Nero's own story. Interestingly, this is told first person and mostly by Nero, but there are two other brief narrators, Locusta the Poisoner and Acte his first love. Both of their outside perspectives were good for seeing him through other eyes.When I read a historical fiction, I am quite aware that it is- well, fiction. What I want to see is a story that is convincing that it could actually happen that way. Or when it is about a person, that it could be true of them. I felt this book did that. Other famous people were part of this story and played their roles in Nero's life and the Roman history at the time.The main character, Nero, was portrayed as a man of his times and their ways were different from our modern ones. He truly believed in the Roman and Greek gods, in curses, in signs and fortunes as did the people. Though that said, Nero saw value in other races and in other classes. It was interesting to see things as the people of that time saw them.For most of this book, Nero is young, but he is also forced to grow up fast. There are orgies and parties, but the author drops a veil over that side just like she stays vague about the brutal side.  Nero appears as a romantic figure and one who wishes to do good by his people. He walks the path alone much of the time because of his heritage and his exalted rank, but he wants true love, friends and he wants to have earned the accolades he is given. He was a great favorite of the common people. I'm a bit of a romantic, too, because reality or not, I enjoyed seeing this side of Nero.This is only part one of the story and it ends abruptly on an ominous note promising things are about to get a bit crazy and bad. Because it's history, I'm well aware what comes in the end. I was glad to have gotten all this earlier history and to know Nero as a man and not just emperor. I would recommend this one for those who enjoy historical fiction and particularly fiction centered around a famous historical figure.My thanks to Penguin-Random House for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3550357-patty", "userReview": "I will start by noting that I have read all of Ms. George\u2019s books; she is one of my favorite authors so I was very excited to see something new and to learn that there is a second book in the series. Perhaps it\u2019s bias but I love going into a book just knowing it\u2019s going to be good. There are a few authors that I completely trust that will be true when I pick up their books and Ms. George is up at the top of that list.In this new book she brings the Roman emperor Nero to life \u2013 you know about Nero, right? The guy who fiddled while Rome burned. Would it surprise you to learn that not everything written about Nero is true? Would it surprise you to learn that some of the more provocative and horrible things written about him were true? But which are and which were a product of the old \u201chistory is written by the victors\u201d school of smear the losers so we winners look all the better? That question gets trickier to answer when an author is dealing with a figure who lived so very long ago. Not much written record has survived and much of what is available was written many years after Nero\u2019s demise.Ms. George does an excellent job of reading between the lines of history to parse the best and the worst of our hero to present a story of a young man who was really never meant to rule but who had a mother who was determined that he would. The book is told in his voice and it starts from when he is very young \u2013 4 years old \u2013 and he is a very prescient child. This was the only (minor) complaint I had with the book. It seemed that the narration maintained its tone for the bulk of Nero\u2019s early life despite beginning at such an early age. It changes towards the end as he comes into his power but for a good third of the book Nero\u2019s voice is similar whether he is a toddler of 4 or a preteen. This is minor and picky but there you go.Other than that I loved, loved, loved this book. It took me back to one of my favorite times in history to one of the emperors about which I didn\u2019t know as much as I would like. Nero is a very complicated character and he admittedly did some awful things but somehow in context and compared to some of the rest of his family he almost seemed angelic. Not to forgive him his actions by any mean but to at least refute some of the worst wrongs of his reputation.The book is a page turner that brings ancient Rome to life for the reader; the architecture, the food, the raucous parties and the machinations of power. It\u2019s a tale of a mother\u2019s desire for power for not just for son but for herself. It\u2019s a story of love and hate, revenge and all that comes with money and power. It\u2019s also the story of a young man who was a poet, musician and strong proponent of the arts at a time when most were not.Read it.

The fire was a result of volcanic activity. There is a follow-up stand alone novel about his reign after the fire. I will probably read that one. I listed to the book on audible.com.

I hoped for something along the lines of I, Claudius, taking the story of the Julio-Claudians into the next generation with the same kind of meaty detail that I enjoyed in Tom Holland's Dynasty. However, George's decision to take a revisionist viewpoint, and present Nero as a well-meaning, misunderstand and popularly-beloved emperor, means that much of the story's dramatic flair is sacrificed. I sense that the book wants to be part of the traditional of fictitious Roman memoirs exemplified by the Memoirs of Hadrian and I, Claudius, but personally I don't feel it reaches this level. It never quite succeeds in creating the deep characterisation that both these books manage so well and, without that rich sense of personality, I found it very hard to see Nero as a person and not as a character on paper. The claustrophobia of court life, the inner torments of a good person forced to do bad things, and the struggle of coming to terms with the rule of a vast empire, could all have been brought out more effectively. Having said that, George has done her research very thoroughly and she is to be congratulated for trying to tell a familiar story in a less sensational and more thoughtful manner. It's just that, personally, I would much prefer a Nero with sharper teeth.For the full review, which will be published on 14 March 2017, please see my blog:https://theidlewoman.net/2017/03/14/t..."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7177008-jane", "userReview": "Interesting take on Nero, an apologia for him, from the years of him as a 3-year old through a message bringing news of the Great Fire of Rome.

There's not much prior knowledge I had about Emperor Nero before I went in to the novel, apart from the image of the madman who watches Rome burn. A further Wiki search also revealed further details like the rise to the throne at the age of 16, matricide, and the murders of his half-brother (and cousin) Britannicus and his first wife Octavia post-divorce. (Romans, I tell you.) All things that immeadiately provide an image of a villainous ruler, and set up the promise of an fascinating read. That could not be further from the truth in George's novel. The novel spans a timeline that covers Nero's life from around the age of 3 and voters the first ten or so years of his rule as emperor, ending on the cliffhanger that the city of Rome is on fire. It's told mainly from Nero's perspective, but there's also a few intermittent chapters from the POV of Locusta, a poisoner, and Acte, a freed-woman who serves Nero's first wife Octavia. All of this has the effect of humanising Nero beautifully - despite all those nasty details I first mentioned. George's Nero is still obviously a product of his time, and the murders and deaths he orders are proof of that. But he is still very much a troubled young man who is struggling to do the best he can with the circumstances he was given.One thing I will say was that I incredibly grateful for the inclusion of a family tree at the beginning of the novel. Roman imperial families were incredibly complexed and had the bad habit of intermarrying amongst themselves (for example, Nero's mother married her uncle, the Emperor Claudius).I'm so keen for the second and final instalment of Nero's life that's still to come.

Narrated in his own words, Nero begins by taking us through the events of his childhood, starting with one of his earliest memories: the time his uncle, the Emperor Caligula, tried to drown him. This is the young Nero\u2019s first experience of the ruthless plotting and scheming which surrounds those close to the imperial family; it is never far from his thoughts as he grows older and, following the deaths of first Caligula and then his successor Claudius, becomes emperor himself.Although, as I\u2019ve mentioned, most of the story is narrated by Nero, there are several much shorter sections scattered throughout the book narrated by two other characters: Locusta, a poisoner whose skills are very much in demand, and Acte, the former slave who becomes Nero\u2019s lover. This was one of the least successful aspects of the book, in my opinion. I really don\u2019t think those sections added anything to the story and I\u2019m not sure why those two characters in particular were chosen, as there were plenty of others who had just as much significance in Nero\u2019s life.Nero himself is portrayed much more sympathetically than I\u2019d expected. Admittedly I don\u2019t know a huge amount about him, but from the little I had previously read I had formed a very different impression of Nero than the one given by this novel. I can see from Margaret George\u2019s author\u2019s note that she has deliberately taken a revisionist approach to Nero\u2019s story, believing that he has been unfairly treated by history and that some of the accounts we rely on for information about him were written to discredit him. I can accept this (it reminds me of the way Tudor propaganda was intended to discredit Richard III) but I personally found this version of Nero far too nice! Nothing was ever really his fault and on occasions where he did commit a wicked act, it was because he had been driven to it and left with no choice. I think a more complex, morally ambiguous character would have been of more appeal to me.I did like the characterisation of the main female characters in the novel, particularly Messalina, Agrippina and Poppaea, three ambitious women each of whom wields power in her own way. Something which comes across very strongly throughout the novel \u2013 and especially when one of these women is involved \u2013 is the continuous sense of danger and the way in which anyone of importance in the Roman Empire had to be constantly on their guard against an attempt on their life.Having such limited knowledge of Ancient Rome, I found the complicated family relationships difficult to follow at first, but I think Margaret George does an excellent job of clarifying them for readers like myself and by the time I was a few chapters into the book I was starting to get Nero\u2019s family tree clear in my mind. As this is quite a long novel and only tells the first half of Nero\u2019s story, it allows plenty of time to explore the major personal and political incidents which take place during this stage of Nero\u2019s life; some of this was familiar to me, but much of it was new and I found it all fascinating. While important events such as Boudicca\u2019s revolt are described in detail, Margaret George also devotes many pages to discussing Nero\u2019s love of music, poetry and sport. I can appreciate how much research must have gone into the writing of this novel!I\u2019m pleased that I\u2019ve read this book as I think I\u2019ve learned a lot from it \u2013 and despite having some negative feelings about it as well as positive ones, I do want to read the rest of the story and will be looking out for the sequel. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been reminded that I have Margaret George\u2019s novel on Mary, Queen of Scots on my TBR \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to it as that\u2019s a period of history I\u2019m much more comfortable with!"}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "It has been a while since I read Margaret George. I have read three of her earlier historical novels and found them a highly palatable way of learning old, old history. (Mary, Queen of Scotland and the Isles, The Memoirs of Cleopatra, and The Autobiography of Henry VIII.) She likes to dig deep and correct historical misperceptions about these larger-than-life characters who left indelible effects on history.She attempts to do the same for Nero, a later emperor of the Roman Empire, best known for fiddling while Rome burned. This volume will have a sequel as it covers only the first half of Nero's life, ending with the fire that left Rome a heap of cinders.Nero was descended from Julius Caesar due to a circuitous family tree that owed much to famous murders and remarriages in the tumultuous ways of empire and power. It opens with an instance of Caligula trying to drown Nero when he was only six and follows his childhood as his ambitious and lethal mother employs a renowned poisoner to do away with anyone who stands in the way of her son becoming Emperor.She succeeds in placing him as such when he is only sixteen. Nero continues in her tradition, eventually having his own mother murdered! It is a bloody tale in which Margaret George tries to show how a young man who loves chariot racing and the arts embraces the role of power while trying to bring culture to a decadent Rome.She is a smooth writer, foregoing long sentences and using only enough description to bring the times and locales to life. However, this time I felt a bit disappointed in an almost too simplistic rendering of a complex man. She certainly makes Nero a sympathetic character, as she did with Mary, Cleopatra, and Henry, but in those earlier books she somehow did a better job (at least in my recollection) of bringing the full personality of those rulers to life. I cried when Mary, Queen of Scots died. I wished I could have met Cleopatra. I almost forgave Henry VIII for killing so many wives.Perhaps part of the problem was that Nero's worst deeds are still ahead of him and I will feel more satisfied when I read the sequel. I read this for a reading group and all the other members loved it. I don't argue that she makes history easy to assimilate and does her research with competence. It could be that Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall trilogy (still waiting for that third volume coming out next year) spoiled me for this kind of historical writing."}], "description": "The New York Times bestselling and legendary author of Helen of Troy and Elizabeth I now turns her gaze on Emperor Nero, one of the most notorious and misunderstood figures in history.Built on the backs of those who fell before it, Julius Caesar's imperial dynasty is only as strong as the next person who seeks to control it.
