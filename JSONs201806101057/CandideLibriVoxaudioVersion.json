Bienvenue au site Goodreads! Qu'en pensez-vous?- It's OK, we can speak English. Pour encourager les autres, as one might say.- Eh... super! I mean, good! So, what do you make of twenty-first century Britain?- Vraiment sympathique! I am reading of your little scandale with the expenses of the Houses of Parliament. It is a great moment for la d\u00e9mocratie. Now there will be des \u00e9lections, the people will be able to choose better representatives, we will see that the country has become stronger as a result...- So really it was a good thing?- Oh, of course, all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds!- What? Including, I don't know, the Iraq War?- Absoluement! It is similar. If M. Bush had not started this very unpopular war, then the American voters would never have decided to choose M. Obama, who you can see is the best possible pr\u00e9sident you could have at this moment tr\u00e8s difficile de l'histoire...- But I think they chose him, more than anything else, because of the economic meltdown?- Bien s\u00fbr, the war on its own would not have been enough, la crise \u00e9conomique also was necessary. All is for the best!- M. Candide, you think that global warming and the impending collapse of the world's climate is also for the best?- Mais, \u00e7a se voit! Because of the global warming, la science et la technologie will be forced to make new avances, people in all countries will start to work together, and we will enter a new golden age. Soon it will be as in El Dorado, that I visited once in l'Amerique du Sud...- Um. So I suppose that the spread of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, genocide in Rwanda and Rush Limbaugh are also good things when you look at them from the right angle?- Evidement! First, le SIDA. By making drug companies and researchers focus on...- No, wait. Forget AIDS. What about Stephenie Meyer?

Here then begins Candide's incredible, fantastical adventure which takes him all over the globe with his mind ever believing in \"The Folly of Optimism\". From being a soldier in the Bulgarian army to being shipwrecked, being involved with the aftermath of an earthquake to being robbed and swindled more times than seems fair. Our hero has a lot of bad luck. One of the points of this book though is to present that it isn't just Candide that bad things happen to and that the world is just pretty horrible. Tragic things happen to all our main characters including philosopher Dr. Pangloss and a nice old lady who saved Candide from certain death. The tale is humorously and satirically presented in short, sharp chapters by Voltaire. Some descriptions of doom and degradation are presented in a comic fashion because if they were not they might be too unspeakable to keep us interested in reading about the negativity and heartlessness of humans. The novel features all sorts of nastiness such as rape, murder, prostitution and slavery among others. The only part of this book where Voltaire excludes any use of humour is when he talks about slavery after we meet a mutilated man. This is quite poignant when presenting all the diabolical activities that slavery doesn't deserve any humour - arguably making this the crime Voltaire begrudges the most in this world. Candide and his valet Cacambo, after nearly being eaten by indigenous people; arrive in Voltaire's Utopia El Dorado. This was my favourite section of the book as this unobtainable existence is a polar opposite of everything that the two young men have faced so far. Gold and diamonds litter the streets as pebbles, there is no law, science advances to make the Western world jealous, no prisons and is opposite to the popular viewpoint of the story that \"all is misery and illusion\". The main plot progression throughout the book is Candide trying to find his love Cunegonde as he wishes to marry her which is his reason for (stupidly in my opinion) leaving this wonderful place. The whole cast is likeable. Some of the times they meet up with friends spontaneously all over the world is amazingly far fetched. Two of the main characters are previously mentioned optimistic philosopher Dr. Pangloss and ultimately pessimistic scholar and travel companion of Candide's, Martin. The juxtaposition here is very interesting. It is very \"black and white\" for these extreme viewpoints. There is no compromise or middle ground. A great amount of philosophy is discussed throughout the book in conversations usually prompted by Candide who wants answers to how the world works. It may very well be that he changes his optimistic opinion throughout the narrative. I probably shouldn't like a book with so much negativity but it is incredibly written. It reminded me of Verne's - Around The World In Eighty Days. Both being high octane adventures transversing across the globe but with Candide's undertones being a lot more macabre.My favourite scene was when Candide discusses classic literature such as Homer, Virgil and Horace to a King who dislikes everything. \"You will agree that this is the happiest of mortals, for he is above everything he possesses.\" Negativity and hatred is a main theme throughout the whole story. The problem with reviewing classic literature like this is that many greater wordsmiths over centuries have written more poetic and moving opinions. Yet, I enjoyed the book so much I had to write down a few blurbs of thoughts however much the quality is lacking compared to previous critics.

The eponymous Candide is a young man tutored by an optimist who is convinced according to the cause and effect philosophy of Leibniz and perhaps is best summarized in Voltaire's leitmotif that human beings live in the \"best of all possible worlds.\" Alexander Pope rather laughably made the same outrageous claim in his \"Essay on Man\" in which he writes, \"Everything that is is right.\" How can this be so, you may well ask? Here is the nut of the problem: it seems that a perfect God has created a highly imperfect world. How can a good, omnipotent, loving God create a world in which so much catastrophic evil exists and which is so often allowed even to thrive? It is a question for the ages. Theologians argue that God created mankind with free will and without it they would simply be puppets without the freedom to make choices. Theologians also point out that the majority of the evil resident in our world is perpetuated on vast masses of humanity by other human beings, not God, and that evil is the cause and effect of conflicting self-interests imposed by people with more power upon the less powerful. But this point doesn't explain why a loving, all-powerful God would allow any of it to exist and endure. Why not cast down all the devils and give his human creatures a perfect garden, a paradise on earth, without snakes anywhere? Why did God create the serpent in the Garden of Eden in the first place? Voltaire, like Rousseau, was an avid gardener and Voltaire jests at Rousseau's good faith in the \"Confessions\" as if the latter were simply a country bumpkin. But gardens have a great deal of meaning in \"Candide\" as in, for example, Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" or \"Genesis\" and are thematically significant for Voltaire who concludes that gardens are, after all, a wise place to reside out of harm's way. Voltaire absolutely skewers the optimistic cause and effect of Pope and Leibniz with a catalog of tragicomic catastrophes which plague not only Candide and Pangloss but all of mankind infinitely. Consider the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 which burst suddenly out of nowhere with all its raging fires and tidal waves to destroy nearly all of the city and the ships in its harbor. Is there no end even to the great catastrophes in which man has no hand but from which we are compelled to suffer except for God's grace? Voltaire's vivid and piercing wit is hilarious as he brazenly brings parody to places high and low, near and far, rich and poor to depict our world as the ultimate dystopia. In his novel Candide can only find a semblance of happiness in El Dorado, a rich, hidden world in South America: in other words, happiness in real life can only be found in a utopia without a basis for reality. So what are we to deduce about Candide? Is he a sometimes violent fool for all his naivete? And is Pangloss not a buffoon who earns his suffering so extensively at every turn of the road for his unjustified, unbridled optimism? Or are they heroic for their optimism despite the epic disasters that nearly devastate them time after time. Or is their fate really just the human condition and are they both just being all too human? You decide. In the course of your reading of this brief novel you may discover, as I did, that the optimists are constantly challenged by the gap between their optimism and reality, and that the pessimists are doomed to be the unhappiest people on the planet because they cannot imagine a world without misery and, thereby, create it for themselves wherever it doesn't really already exist. Take your pick of perspectives as a \"free\" human being and challenge your own assumptions about the human condition. Clearly, Balzac would seem to agree with his compatriot, Voltaire, that whatever you make of life on this earth, surely it is no less than an epic human comedy. At least in this life, thankfully, if you can stand back far enough, there is, God knows, no end to the laughter of the human condition."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Slightly disappointed with the next-Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I took on this classic in one sitting.J**US!Where has this one been all my life?

If, on the other hand, everything is for the best in this best of possible worlds, as the optimist philosopher Pangloss claims in admiration for Leibniz' idea of a benevolent, planning, organised deity, the above question is fair and scary. What are the other worlds like, if this is the best the creator can manage? Candide is born into a garden Eden and taught the dogma of optimistic thinking before being thrown out into the cruel world and embarking on an absurdly funny, incredibly brutal and increasingly cynical odyssey around a fictionalised, yet recognisable violent and unfair world. Consistently striving to understand his surroundings, he keeps asking questions and challenging the people he meets, and he keeps reflecting on the events he witnesses, such as the earthquake in Lisbon in 1755. How does reality fit in with metaphysical thoughts? Is it possible to reconcile life and faith and satisfy both body and soul, while facing the blatant inequality in the world?In the end, Candide resigns himself to his own, active but detached business of \"cultiver notre jardin\", - working to be able to shut out the atrocities of the world. He emancipates himself from the philosophical framework of his teacher Pangloss, even though he lets him keep on reflecting in his typical way, thus demonstrating more tolerance than Pangloss himself accomplishes.When I first read Candide, some twenty years ago, I thought of it as a roller coaster ride through different societies, on a quest to find individual meaning and happiness by figuring out what matters in life. I considered the external circumstances and the Leibnizian optimism a highly exaggerated sarcastic joke, a backdrop for the development of the idea that bliss is to be found in active, yet private pursuit of small scale business without dogmatic allegiances to any creed, be it religious, social or political.Now I am not so sure about the exaggeration anymore - having spent decades studying the interactions between human beings, and their habit of labelling a \"total disaster\" a \"great win\", positioning themselves somewhere in the grey zone between delusional optimism, brutal cynicism and complete disregard for truth.\"L'optimisme c'est la rage de soutenir que tout est bien quand on est mal.\"If that is what the leaders of the world support, and the majority of populations accept in resignation while minding their own private business, how can we ever get to the point of attempting to fix the problems of this best of possible worlds?Acknowledging the issues would be the first step, wouldn't it? If we maintain climate change isn't happening, we will have human-induced catastrophes of the scale of the flood following the Lisbon earthquake. If we do not fight injustice and violence, but claim it is part of the bigger picture of the best possible of worlds, life will continue to be as brutal for our contemporaries as it was for Candide and his friends:\u201cI should like to know which is worse: to be ravished a hundred times by pirates, and have a buttock cut off, and run the gauntlet of the Bulgarians, and be flogged and hanged in an auto-da-fe, and be dissected, and have to row in a galley -- in short, to undergo all the miseries we have each of us suffered -- or simply to sit here and do nothing?'That is a hard question,' said Candide.\u201d Having grown older, and more angry at the world, I do not agree with the two options presented. Life is not either about passively suffering it or withdrawing from the world altogether, it is about actively looking for change. It is about honestly admitting that we do not live in the best possible of worlds, while keeping up the fight to make it a tiny bit better, despite feeling despair creeping into our hearts every so often. It is about \"cultiver notre jardin\" - but not hidden away in a remote corner. The garden of our shared global community has to be tended! It is not oblivious, exclusive Eden, and never will be. But it can be a good enough place to live, if the Candides of this world decide to make it a common project - one that shows collaborative commitment despite continuous disappointment. I still love Candide with all my heart, but I think it is about time he applies the knowledge he gained from travelling the world to make it a more bearable place to be - for all people - starting by telling optimistic Pangloss that facts are more important than a false mantra hiding the issues under propaganda.Il faut cultiver notre plan\u00e8te - malgr\u00e9 tout!"}, {"userName": "Lizzy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30575403-lizzy", "userReview": "I dedicate this review to my dear friend Roger, a writer of inspiring reviews. This is in great part in answer to your question: \"Do you ever read anything light?\"Roger made me think: what major literature work, as nothing less would do!, that I read would fit the definition of light? Of course, Candide came up front to my mind. And what makes Candide so brilliant and hilarious? Not one think, but various factors combined: 1. Remarkable characters: a hopelessly na\u00efve protagonist, for whom you have no choice but be sympathetic with; wastrel nobles, besides a motley group from priests to prostitutes, philosophers (how could Voltaire not include a parody of himself?) ending with fanatics and fiends; 2. The absurdity of its plot: The plot is dizzying, hectic and horrifying, while its protagonist goes from nobility to serfdom, from penury to extravagance, from significance and misery to anonymity and contentment. Wholly unconventional! And its readers become dazzled by its unfolding events that that despite being absurd are also utterly real;3. The genius of Voltaire: as you turn the pages you realize that\u2019s he is there, peeking from behind the curtains into the stage, whispering to you: It could all be true! Oh, yes! So, a long string of jokes creeps from the pages to the reader, absurdities that are not so absurd; and enriches the reading experience with insight into its context. Candide reveals itself as a long-gone-road-trip Journal of genuine charitable naivety. The tragedies and violence are never ending, more than anybody\u2019s fair share. Poor Candide, he skips from one misadventure to another: gets kicked out of his home; is drafted into the army; gains a fortune, loses his fortune; chases the object of his desire all over the world:\n\u201cI should like to know which is worse: to be ravished a hundred times by pirates, and have a buttock cut off, and run the gauntlet of the Bulgarians, and be flogged and hanged in an auto-da-fe, and be dissected, and have to row in a galley -- in short, to undergo all the miseries we have each of us suffered -- or simply to sit here and do nothing?\u201d\n At all his disasters and misfortunes, his teacher and traveling companion Dr. Pangloss simply rationalizes: \n'it is all for the best!'\n This is the best possible world we live in, and the bad things that occur happen to be the best to show us the blessing of what we have. Is that it? Voltaire goes further:\n \u201c'It is demonstrable,' said he, 'that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. Stones were made to be hewn and to construct castles, therefore My Lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Swine were intended to be eaten, therefore we eat pork all the year round: and they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best.'\u201d\nHow could it not be more absurd and hilarious! And so Voltaire succeeds in ridiculing his world. And, in a way, our own!\n\u201cAll events are linked together in the best of possible worlds; after all, if you had not been driven from a fine castle by being kicked in the backside for love of Miss Cunegonde, if you hadn't been sent before the Inquisition, if you hadn't traveled across America on foot, if you hadn't given a good sword thrust to the baron, if you hadn't lost all your sheep from the good land of Eldorado, you wouldn't be sitting here eating candied citron and pistachios. \nExhausted, Candide finally finds his just-retreat \"[w]e must cultivate our garden.\"Yes, Candide is one of my favorite books, and it occupies a very special place in that collection."}, {"userName": "K.D.

Her barron father of the lady does not approve of the affair so he kicks Candide out from house. So, Candide wanders around and meets all the misfortunes along the way. The novel is a picaresque as the long travel, meeting a lot of people and experiencing all the fortunes and misfortunes along the way, ends up with Candide enjoying his life and tending the beautiful garden of his estate.This is the reason why I, after more than 3 years, went to our frontyard this morning and tended my overgrown garden. I pruned the trees and the shrubs, trimmed the plants, pulled out some weeds while my daughter helped in shooing away big red ants and removing the cobwebs. Reading has these all positive effects on me. It can even remind me of the things that I have been forgetting for a long time. This novel closes with this line: \"That is well said,\" replied Candide, \"but we must cultivate our garden.\". When I finished reading it last night, I said, why not? Its complete title is \nCandide or Optimism\n because of Candide's tutor, Doctor Pangloss who is an extreme optimist that Candide learns to always look at the positive side of things. You may say that I liked this book because of that. Wrong. The positivity of Dr. Pangloss is one for the books as it verges on stupidity and it is so funny when Candide remembers him and says \"I wonder what would Pangloss say if he was here?\" Having an English word culled from his name is really appropriate. He is really one for the books.A life err routine-changing novel since I am gardening again after 3 long years of doing nothing at home but reading, reading and reading...

God that pisses me off, especially since none of those books are worth a damn, and while the authors wrongly think they have something interesting or unique to say, the thing that really disheartens me is that someone out there agrees with them. For each of these books, there should be a simple label affixed to the front cover that reads \u2018Not As Good As Candide\u2019. I seriously think this would alleviate about 30% of all my unresolved issues with the public\u2019s perception of what makes for decent reading. The other 70% could be resolved by making major overhauls to a universal \u2018required reading\u2019 list: The Great Gatsby, eh\u2026.let\u2019s just toss that crap out and put Cosmos on there, how about actually learning something while you read?\tI\u2019m not about to give Candide a perfect score, and I don\u2019t think that it deserves one, but I will say that it\u2019s damn good. It seems that some of the popular philosophy making the rounds back in Francois-Marie\u2019s day was just rubbing him wrong, especially the absolutely moronic concept that we live in \u2018the best of all possible worlds\u2019. Most people hear something that weak and simply binge drink to erase the awful memory that somebody out there could possibly believe that kind of shit. A lot of people write against these notions and somehow get their pitiful little whims published in the commentary of the local newspaper, and you wish you could choke those imbeciles as well, for giving more press to an already absurd concept. Lastly, there are the few that decide to sit down and write a satire about a hundred pages long to denounce what they consider absolute folly. \tAnd with Candide, Voltaire relentlessly attacks the ridiculous philosophy of Liebniz and his familiars, attempting to show that this is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the best of all possible worlds (mainly because of the large number of utter clods totally f--king up the works). Our hero, Candide, is a naive youth being reared in the castle of a Westphalian Baron, living the good life while being tutored by a total fraud and hack named Pangloss, the Baron\u2019s oracle/scholar. The only hindrance in the life of our featherbedded little friend is that his love interest, Cunogonde, happens to be the Baron\u2019s vivacious 17-year old daughter, and the Baron isn\u2019t about to have his daughter betrothed to some chump lacking the amount of noble ancestry suitable to his standards. The soothing, silver tongue of Pangloss has made an indelible mark on Candide, however, and when the opportunity arises to plant a surreptitious smooch on Cunegonde, he\u2019s busted in the act and driven from the castle \u201cwhen the Baron saluted Candide with some notable kicks on the rear\u201d. That\u2019s just hilarious, 'notable kicks', and there\u2019s something this appealing on basically every page to follow: as this is only just the beginning; the first misfortune to befall our thick-skulled friend, Candide. Each successive f--king he suffers along the way is not only totally hilariously described in an absurd fashion, but is usually resolved in awesomely unreal turns of fate (I don\u2019t think I could make it more than five pages without either cracking a smile or outright laughing for all the right reasons). The Baron\u2019s castle is sacked by Bulgarians following Candide\u2019s exile, setting the lively and luscious Cunegonde in flight from Westphalia as well, and one unfortunate event after another befalls both lovers; with Candide\u2019s life quickly becoming filled with floggings, poverty, the Inquisition. natural disasters, piracy, and getting pimp-jacked as a result of some devious manipulation, while his beloved is reduced to harlotry, being ravished or ravaged, and unbecoming servitude at the hands of her completely offensive captors and suitors.

His soul was revealed in his face. He combined rather sound judgment with great simplicity of mind; it was for this reason, I believe, that he was given the name of Candide.\"I have to admit straightaway that in my youth, I was most like the na\u00efve and often foolish Candide, believing in the teachings of the optimistic Dr. Pangloss that \"all is for the best\". Though not expelled from my castle and \"earthly paradise\" for falling in love with the wrong young man and forcing the wrath of his parent to fall upon my shoulders, I did leave my humble abode to find independence, seek fortune and to live happily ever after. I knew there existed hardships in the world, but they could never really affect me personally, could they? Well, I am thankful to say that such misfortunes did not fall directly upon me as they did for Candide and the other characters of this penetrating and often comical little book. After his expulsion from the castle of Westphalia, Candide experiences, witnesses and hears about one horrific calamity after another as he travels the world \u2013 murder, war, rape, the Inquisition, theft, natural disasters and more. The events are often quite shocking and sometimes on the verge of being simply absurd (when you read about the old woman you will see what I mean here). I may not have been the wretched victim of such outrageous atrocities, yet as I began to make my own way in the world I grew to understand that such evil really did exist all around me. Candide, while not completely disillusioned, begins to question the faith of the ever so hopeful Dr. Pangloss. If given the opportunity to discuss what he has endured with this great philosopher, Candide believes Pangloss \"would have told us admirable things about the physical and moral evils that cover the earth and the sea, and I would have felt strong enough to venture a few respectful objections.\"So, Candide matures and hardens a bit, but continues on with a morsel of optimism. As he continues his voyage, Candide deliberately seeks to find \"the most unfortunate\" and \"most disgusted\" man to travel with him. Thus he meets Martin. We have all probably met a Martin. Some days, when I hear about the ugliness in the world, I feel like a Martin myself. Martin maintains that God has abandoned this world. He declares \"I\u2019ve almost never seen a town that didn\u2019t desire the ruin of some neighboring town, or a family that didn\u2019t want to exterminate some other family. Everywhere in the world, the weak detest the strong and grovel before them, and the strong treat them like flocks of sheep to be sold for their meat and wool.\" And so, how does one continue to live in this world? Should one bear extreme optimism like Dr. Pangloss or extreme pessimism like Martin?

Voltaire is supposed to have written the whole thing in barely three days \u2013 a rather productive half-week.What I found particularly interesting here was the discussion of war \u2013 how the horrors of war are presented in such an off-hand way and almost invariably the utter inhumanity of what is described (rape and even eating half of someone\u2019s bum) is just chalked up to \u2018the way things are\u2019. The question of free will, human agency and responsibility for our actions \u2013 something that the notion of our living in the best of all possible worlds does much to undermine \u2013 is never far from the surface here, but invariably it remains just under the surface. This is a \u2018show, don\u2019t tell\u2019 book \u2013 even if the showing is heavy-handed in the extreme. It would take a particularly committed optimist to go through what the characters in this book do and come out the other end still thinking the world is beyond any possibility of improvement.What I particularly liked, though, was the very end and the garden that is being tended. It is through Candide\u2019s labours to create this garden that he finally finds some sense of human dignity, stability and even a kind of happiness. The book is otherwise the odyssey of a fool, but this final acceptance of life as struggle and a kind of stoic acceptance of the rewards that come from labour is quite a lovely thing, really. Even before I got to the end I kept thinking the whole way through the book about how different Eastern and Western notions of these things are and have been. When the Buddha was first confronted by the world outside his idyllic palace he realised life was suffering. It is odd that when we in the West are confronted with much the same vision of the world around us we all too often excuse that suffering as being necessary for the greater good. This little book by Voltaire shows such inhumanity isn\u2019t a necessary assumption of the Western tradition, that sometimes even we can be shocked by the horrors we inflict on others and even humbled by suffering."}, {"userName": "J.G. Keely", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely", "userReview": "This book does not stick so well in my memory in either a negative or positive way, but I think this comes from the book being a mixture of two things which I could not feel more differently about: allegory and satire.The first I find to be as silly and pointless as Aesop or Passion Plays. Characters in an allegory are oversimplified symbols, and so cannot comment on the nature of actual human beings. The style is already so firmly affixed to cultural states and norms that it cannot really say anything beyond the dichotomous, and dualists are blinded by their egos.I do love satire, but that is generally because of the wit and skill it takes to subvert and re-imagine. Unfortunately, once one has drawn so deeply on hyperbole in a work, it loses its ability to find that necessarily uncomfortable 'grey area'--that rift between assumption and observation.Voltaire is witty and funny, but his condemnation and praise falls only on unrealistic absolutes, and hence becomes only political rather than philosophical. In this, he becomes in many ways Shakespeare's opposite; whose characters were so vaguely sketched that they could be held representative of many disparate identities.It is too easy to force and distort arguments when the accepted givens are so strictly defined and counterpointed. This problem should be evident to anyone in America today who sees how opposition to ideas is transformed into meaninglessly pejorative identities. The temptation of thought-terminating cliches grows ever more in the face of such opposing forces as Voltaire presents.No doubt much of Voltaire's popularity stems from the fact that he is so narrowly applicable and divisive. In this way he almost works like a philosopher since his ideas are so forcefully professed. However, unlike a philosopher he represents his opponents in a state of utter ridicule, he is less convincing than polarizing.The other part of Voltaire's popularity comes from his empty century. The Seventeenth had Shakespeare and Milton. The Nineteenth showed the ridiculously fecund blossoming of the Romantics. The Eighteenth, however, has Fielding, Swift, Voltaire, and Pope. Fielding has escaped as wide a reading because his satire was more social than strictly political. Pope and Swift were likewise satirists, but of such a fanciful nature as to escape more simplistic and contentious forces. This leaves us with the more accessible Voltaire, who may be used to attack ideas, but not to build upon them."}, {"userName": "Saleh MoonWalker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL":

addition of a heavy dollop of extra absurdity, you are getting close to the nature of Candide. That absurdity is what makes the tale funny and without it, it would be an unpaletable concoction.There is a good deal of social and political satire, something I often find to be a little weak; it's easy to point and laugh, harder to say what might be better. Voltaire, does however, offer some kind of alternative that he thinks is better than what he is lampooning, which is greatly to his credit.I suppose I should explain how Candide relates to the other works mentioned above:It's like Don Quixote in that the protagonist is frequently physically abused and this is used as broad humour and also in that the tale starts of as a rapid set of incidents and then slows down into some sort of coherent narrative. (This change being seen between parts one and two of Don Quixote.) It is like the Inferno in that certain historical figures and Voltaire's contemporary enemies keep turning up in order to be lambasted. It is like Erewhon in that there is a visit to Eldorado, a mythical country which is used to highlight supposed social absurdities back in Europe, Erewhon does the same thing, though perhaps not in the same way: contrast is used in Candide, whereas transposition of ideas into other realms is used in Erewhon. As for the Book of Job, well, the frequency and extremity of misfortunes heaped on Candide bears a resemblence to those heaped on Job by Satan.Candide has a big advantage over all the works listed above: it's short. This edition has on facing pages the original French and an English translation and is still not much more than 150p. The fact that it can cover such a broad territory in such a condensed space is impressive. It's an easy read, too - so I think you should read it. It should make you think as well as laugh."}, {"userName": "Nikoleta", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13362307-nikoleta", "userReview": "\u0393\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd, \u03bf \u00ab\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2\u00bb \u0392\u03bf\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u039a\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03c4 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \"\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\" \u03bc\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2, \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9.\u03a4\u03bf \u039a\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03c4 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7.\u039f \u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1\u03c2, \u03bf \u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03c4 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd, \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0392\u03bf\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5.\u039f \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1. \u0397 \u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae), \u03b7 \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b5\u03be\u03c9\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9. \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1. \u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5."}, {"userName": "Siti", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70149062-siti", "userReview": "Romanzo filosofico pubblicato nel 1759, mescola l\u2019elemento fantastico con la riflessione filosofica. Trenta capitoli per ironizzare sulle filosofie ottimistiche e in particolare sul pensiero di Leibniz, il sostenitore dell\u2019armonia dell\u2019universo e della tesi che quello in cui viviamo sia il migliore dei mondi possibili nonostante l\u2019esistenza del male dovuta all\u2019imperfezione umana, male giustificato con l\u2019idea che da una male individuale possa derivare un bene collettivo o che il male presente faccia derivare un bene futuro.Candido, educato dal filosofo Pangloss alle teorie dell\u2019ottimismo, pensa appunto di vivere nel migliore dei mondi possibili, fin quando una serie di peripezie non lo portano a scontrasi con il mondo e la realt\u00e0 che sono invece dominati dal male: guerra, colonialismo, religioni, condizione della donna, chiesa. Una denuncia dei mali del mondo che si conclude con la massima \u201cbisogna che lavoriamo nel nostro orto\u201d a sottolineare che solo l\u2019impegno personale nel quotidiano fa di noi degli uomini , veri cittadini de mondo, concorrenti a generare il benessere generale nonostante l\u2019esistenza del male. Perch\u00e9 leggere Candido?Avrei una serie di motivazioni ma ognuno va a cercarsi la propria. Le mie sono queste. La prossima mia lettura sar\u00e0 il Candido di Sciascia il quale tent\u00f2 di sgravarsi della pesantezza del tempo che viveva e rappresentava riproducendo la velocit\u00e0 e la leggerezza del conte philosophique, era dunque necessario esperire l\u2019originale. L\u2019opera rappresenta inoltre un classico antologizzato in Perch\u00e9 leggere i classici di Calvino il quale risponde per me affermando che \u201cleggere per la prima volta un grande libro in et\u00e0 matura \u00e8 un piacere straordinario\u201d che nasce dalla capacit\u00e0 di apprezzare maggiormente un testo rispetto alla giovinezza per via dell\u2019esperienza del mondo e della lettura stessa di cui si \u00e8 portatori e che, per le stesse ragioni, dona un sapore particolare alle riletture dei medesimi classici. Avrei inoltre la volont\u00e0 di proseguire la lettura del testo di Calvino, insieme di brevi e preziosi saggi su testi classici avendone una conoscenza diretta della maggioranza fra quelli che tratta perch\u00e9 reputo inutile cimentarmi in uno studio critico senza conoscerne direttamente l\u2019oggetto, consapevole del fatto che la lettura di un classico \u00e8 lo scontro con una serie di resistenze (lettura impegnata, non fluida, costruzione di un sapere, ricerca) che tende a risolversi in una grande gioia e spesso, come suggerisce lo stesso Calvino, nel divertimento. Ecco Il Candido di Voltaire \u00e8 l\u2019esempio perfetto: una prosa veloce, chiara, lucida, una struttura snella, una trama rocambolesca, fanno di questo testo una lettura piacevole e divertente. Se a questi elementi si unisce l\u2019aspettativa di andare a compiere un giro del mondo in brevissimo tempo percorrendo continenti e avvenimenti storici di fine Settecento, utili a comprendere questo pazzo mondo, in un\u2019 infinita serie di improbabili ma gustosissime agnizioni, allora penso che qualcuna delle mie motivazioni possa se non divenire la vostra almeno spingervi verso questo romanzo."}, {"userName": "Sud666", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666", "userReview": "Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet better known by his nom de plum Voltaire. During the French Englightenment he was a renowned author of a multitude of books covering a wide array of topics from history to science. But Voltaire is best known as a scathing satirist. His strong views on the established Catholic Church, and his advocacy of freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and separation of church and state caused him to become famous but also a controversial figure. This caused him to have to frequently change his country and led him through France to Great Britain and Prussia, eventually back to France. In that time Voltaire kept company with a variety of people from Fredrick of Prussia to Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon.In 1758 he moved to Ferney near the Franco-Swiss border. It is here that he wrote his famous Candide, ou l'Optimisme (Candide, the Optimist).First and foremost, I was struck by just how funny this is. The biting satire of Voltaire is non-stop and still has the capability to amuse centuries later. So we meet Candide, the Illegitimate son of the sister of the baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh. He is in love with Cunegonde, the Baron's daughter. Candide is tutored by Prof. Pangloss who practices Liebnizian philosophy (optimism). Everything from the name of the German baron to Dr. Pangloss' specialization which is listed as a \"m\u00e9taphysico-th\u00e9ologo-cosmolonigologie\" is meant to be funny. Candide is driven out from the Baron's castle due to his love and what follows his his trials and tribulations as he travels around the world. It is the dry wit and Candide's attempts to balance his awful luck and circumstances with the philosophy of optimism that make this a wonderful tale. It is truly amazing wit, that still raises eyebrows today and must have been downright shocking in the late 1700's. The style is like Douglas Adams in that the humor is nonstop. Sometimes it is obvious, as with the names of the characters, and other times its subtly placed in the text with phrases such as :\"...whom this lady would never marry because he could prove only seventy-one generations of nobility..\" or \"...the Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had a door and windows..\"This acerbic humor continues throughout the rest of this darkly comedic tale. While it is funny, we must not forget to read what Voltaire says about the Church, religion, the nobility, etc. He manages to convey these messages without ever becoming preachy. Rather he cloaks these very serious issues in a comedic guise and that makes them even more stark. This is a book that one can read as a historical document that shows the mindset of one of the great French Enlightenment authors or just as a very funny work of fiction. Either way, this is a book well worth reading. The humor is obvious, even after all this time, and manages to make people laugh. The sheer absurdity of the adventure and the variety of characters (all some manner of parody) make this a great tale. Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good tale."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee", "userReview": "Had no idea this was so cray.

Satirical, philosophical, funny like the butchered Black Knight in \"The Holy Grail.\" Loved the bit about scholar of good taste's advice for what makes a successful tragedy -- what seemed like straight-up authorial sincerity slipped into the serious silliness. Ultimately it's lesson is keep quiet, be industrious, cultivate the garden, stop thinking so much and do.
