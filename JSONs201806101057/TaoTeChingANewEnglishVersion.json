So it may seem strange that I\u2019m reviewing the Tao Te Ching, the widely known and influential Taoist text, written by Lao-Tzu and poetically translated in this edition by Stephen Mitchell. For me, the Tao Te Ching is more folk wisdom than religious treatise and is more useful than a million sermons.Where the Tao Te Ching parts company with religious attempts at morality such as the 10 Commandments is in its inclusiveness. Seven of the 10 Commandments don\u2019t mention God and are sound advice designed to facilitate peaceful community relations: respect your elders, don't kill, don't cheat on your spouse, don't steal, don't tell lies, and don't lust after another's spouse or his belongings. For me, the tragedy of the Great List is that the three that top it serve only to divide the world into believers and nonbelievers: regardless how closely you follow the last seven, if you don\u2019t believe in God you\u2019re not worth a fig. In doing so the first three create division where the last seven seek harmony. With Taoism, even if you don\u2019t believe in the Force-like nature of the Tao\u2014and in case there\u2019s any question, I don\u2019t\u2014you can still consider yourself a Taoist.Taoism seeks harmony by freeing the individual from the caustic effects of judgmental thinking, desire, and greed, and its fulcrum is the concept of \u201cnon-action,\u201d or literally \u201cdoing not-doing.\u201d Non-action, Mitchell writes in his introduction, is not the act of doing nothing but instead is the purest form of action: \u201cThe game plays the game; the poem writes the poem; we can\u2019t tell the dancer from the dance.\u201dThis slim book is both a quick read and a long study. Mitchell\u2019s lyrical rendering of the Tao Te Ching might read to some like silly hippie clich\u00e9s, but there\u2019s more to it than that. Take chapter 9, a photocopy of which hung on my office corkboard for years:Fill your cup to the brim and it will spill.Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt.Chase after money and security and your heart will never unclench.Care about people\u2019s approval and you will be their prisoner.You can almost see the hacky sack and smell the patchouli. But there\u2019s a truth to it that, if grasped, will change the way you think.As chapter 1 states: \u201cThe tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao./The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\u201d Analogy, then, plays an important role in understanding the Tao Te Ching, and the reader has to do quite a bit of work\u2014the long study part\u2014to fathom the book\u2019s richness. Take chapter 11 in its entirety, where non-action is discussed:We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move.We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want.We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable.We work with being, but non-being is what we use.There is more to the book than philosophical abstraction. In fact, common sense pervades the Tao Te Ching. Take these lines, which discuss the roots of crime: \u201cIf you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal\u201d (chapter 2) and \u201cIf you don\u2019t trust the people you make them untrustworthy\u201d (chapter 17). Or these, from chapter 38, which describe the toll of illusory thought: When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.When goodness is lost, there is morality.When morality is lost, there is ritual.Ritual is the husk of true faith,The beginning of chaos.Therefore the Master concerns himself with the depths and not the surface,With the fruit and not the flower.He has no will of his own.He dwells in reality, and lets all illusions go.I\u2019m telling you, had I been born into Taoism I might actually believe in something."}, {"userName": "Foad", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL":

"\u201cThe Tao is always nameless\u201d (Chapter 71)Trying to narrow down the philosophy of the Tao Te Ching with limiting words is to violate its primordial essence. How can one describe the Universe, the natural order of things, the incessant flowing from being to non-being, the circular unity of a reality traditionally mismatched in dualistic terms? The Tao Te Ching doesn\u2019t provide answers because there needn\u2019t be questions, just the harmony of moulding to the landscape rather than trying to impose a particular shape on it.The Tao Te Ching is the route in itself, the path to emptying the human mind of ambitions, schemes and desires and allow it to be flooded with the smoothness of humility and the exhilarating liberation of a simple life.The Tao Te Ching exults the feminine yin over the masculine yang in the eternal interdependence of opposites, identifying its indwelling suppleness with the intrinsic elements of the Tao. \u201cThe great state should be like a river basin.The mixing place of the world,The feminine of the world.The feminine always overcomes the masculine by its softnessBecause softness is lesser.\u201d  (Chapter 61)Thus the Tao cannot be expressed, it has no name, it is indivisible, inaudible and immutable but also the origin of multiplicity that gives way to ambivalent interpretation, which in turn engenders the befuddling suspicion that the more one wants to unravel the Tao the less one masters it because its aim relays precisely in attaining unforced wisdom.Composed of eighty one aphorisms with aesthetic lyricism reminiscent of ancient riddles or even taunting wordplay, the Tao Te Ching dismisses moral teachings, embraces paradoxical dichotomies and differentiates itself from other doctrines like Confucianism because it relays in intuition rather than in duty rooted on imposed moral principles or any other contrived authority.According to the introduction (*), some schools of thought have accused the Tao of endorsing chaotic anarchy and of not responding to consistent criteria, but such ambiguity in the use of language and its playful axioms are in fact a pure reflection of its skeptical views on measuring all actions according to artificial rules disguised as traditional rituals.I can\u2019t claim to have found everlasting serenity in connecting to the natural flow of Taoism and accepting its philosophy of \u201caction through inaction\u201d, but the idea of finding comfort in the constant contradiction of the positive and negative forces within oneself in order to embrace the convoluted intricacies of existence casts an overwhelming shadow to the absolute dichotomies and blind beliefs prompted by the more familiar monotheistic \u201cfear based\u201d religions, where guilt, punishment and suffering are the conduits to salvation.Why crave for redemption if we learn to follow the \u201cway things are\u201d and welcome the natural interdependence between opposites, accepting disorder, nothingness and non-being as part of the indestructible unity of all things?\u201cThere is nothing better than to know that you don\u2019t know\u201d (Chapter 71)(*) Note: The Barnes & Nobles edition comes with an explanatory introduction about the origins of the Tao, a very useful epilogue and an historical timeline of the identity of its mysterious author(s). Highly recommended edition."}, {"userName": "Burt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286714-burt", "userReview": "This is, by far, my favorite translation of the Tao Te Ching. I own a few others and they're all well and good, but this one is the one I continually read from and refer to when people ask me about the Tao.The translation is well done, it captures the nature of the text well, and it flows fairly evenly. It's not overly flowery or ornate, it gives you the basics of what you need to understand the various entries and assist in understanding what Tao is (i.e. the the Tao named Tao is not the great, eternal Tao).It's a book that changed my life. I learned of Taoism in a world history class in high school, and when my friends took their Philosophy 101 course at the local university this was the text they worked with. My copy came second hand from the U's bookstore and I have had it ever since. It has taught me to understand a lot of the things in the world that otherwise would baffle me and lends a lot to my own personal philosophies.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is lost on their path through life. It doesn't have all of the answers, but it does have a LOT of perspective."}, {"userName": "Eddie Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1131783-eddie-watkins", "userReview": "There are many translations of the Taoteching, nearly every one of which is probably worth reading, but this is my favorite version. I can\u2019t attest to the accuracy of the translation, but having read so many different translations of the same text I feel like in some strange way I have a grasp of the original; as if a blank space (the Chinese original) has been given shape and definition by all the English versions surrounding it. But anyway... while I like the spare sensitivity of the language in this version, what makes this version extra special are the added bonuses: an engagingly detailed introduction exploring the life of Lao Tzu, what amounts to an original thesis on the very meaning of \u201ctao\u201d, and commentaries (on specific lines, even specific words) appended to each of the 81 entries that have been culled from centuries upon centuries of critical commentary, by scholars and eccentric mystics alike.There is recent scholarship that is making the argument that instead of meaning \u201cway\u201d or \u201cpath\u201d, which is usually taken to mean how we as people conduct ourselves in accordance with a mysterious spiritual principle, that \u201ctao\u201d actually refers to the Moon and its various phases and paths in space, with particular emphasis on the darkness of the new moon and its significance as potential in darkness. The new moon \u201chides\u201d its fullness. The fullness is there in potential, unspent. I like this. There\u2019s something pleasingly primitive about it (gimme that old-time religion!), i.e. something real and tangibly mysterious, but also something practical and spiritual \u2013 a connector between eye and heart that through some subtle gravity guides our feet along a path.The commentaries that follow each poem or entry are fascinating and just scratch the surface of what I understand is a vast accumulation of scholarship on this text. The commentaries are often wildly contradictory and tangential, obsessive to an anal nth degree, but also at times wise in their own right. These commentaries have been written by official scholars, by mendicant monks, and even one or two extreme eccentrics living on the fringes of society unaffiliated with any institution. At the back of the book are short biographies of each commentator, which is fascinating reading in itself. It all adds up to evidence that this is a living book, with enough clear and direct meaning to be perpetually valid, and enough obscurity to be endlessly pondered.The translator is an American who goes by the name Red Pine. He\u2019s almost 70 now and has been a practicing Buddhist for years, but more in the wandering independent scholar Gary Snyder type style. He\u2019s also translated the Diamond Sutra, poems of Han Shan (Cold Mountain) and Stonehouse, and some other Buddhist texts. In every work of his I\u2019ve read there\u2019s serious scholarship in evidence, but also a free spirit and independent thinker with a unique store of fresh air."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0633\u0648\u0645 \u0622\u06af\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0644 2012 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u062a\u0627\u0626\u0648 \u062a\u0647 \u0686\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0644\u0627\u0626\u0648 \u062a\u0632\u0648\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u06cc\u061b \u0648\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0631: \u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0628 \u06a9\u0648\u0634\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0627\u060c 1379\u061b \u062f\u0631 109 \u0635\u061b\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u062a\u0627\u0626\u0648 \u062a\u0647 \u0686\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0644\u0627\u0626\u0648 \u062a\u0632\u0648\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0641\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u062f \u0642\u0647\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0634\u0642\u060c 1382\u061b \u062f\u0631 81 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9649447229\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631: \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u062b\u0644\u062b\u060c 1383\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9648496064\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 1386\u061b \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0645 \u0648 \u0634\u0634\u0645 1387\u061b \u0647\u0641\u062a\u0645 \u0648 \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0645 1388\u061b \u0646\u0647\u0645 1389\u061b \u06cc\u0627\u0632\u062f\u0647\u0645 1390\u061b \u062f\u0648\u0627\u0632\u062f\u0647\u0645 1391\u061b \u0633\u06cc\u0632\u062f\u0647\u0645 \u062a\u0627 \u067e\u0627\u0646\u0632\u062f\u0647\u0645 1392\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789648496062\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u0631\u0627\u0647\u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0646\u0631 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0686\u06cc\u0646\u06cc -

{"userName": "Heidi Parton", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4374772-heidi-parton", "userReview": "This version irritates me a lot, largely because of Stephen Mitchell's arrogance in writing it (I'll go into that in a bit). This is not a translation (which Mitchell was at least gracious enough to make clear in the back of the book); it's a translation of various translations. The problem with this is that a translation of a translation turns out the same way that a copy of a copy does: while some of the original words and phrases are identifiable, there's a lot that's lost or skewed.For example, here is a good translation of the first line of Ch. 3 by D.C. Lau: \"Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention.\"Stephen Mitchell's translation of the same line is: \"If you overesteem great men, / people become powerless.\"The original Wang Bi character in question is \u722d, or zh\u0113ng, which means \"dispute,\" \"strive,\" \"contend,\" \"fight,\" etc. It does not mean \"powerless.\" By free-handing the translation, Mitchell alters the meaning of the text. While it doesn't damage the understanding of someone already familiar with Taoism and its literature, it does mislead those new to Taoism who seek an authentic introductory text to understand the philosophy.As I mentioned above, what really irritates me is Mitchell's arrogance regarding his version of the text versus the original Chinese versions and the translations that more closely adhere to their meaning. In the question-and-answer section located in the back of the book, the querent says: \"But it's one thing to translate Rilke and the Book of Job when you read German and Hebrew; it's quite another to translate books like the Tao Te Ching, the Bhagavad Gita, or Gilgamesh without any knowledge of the original languages.\" Mitchell's response is: \"Yes, it's a different kind of venture, but not so different as you might think. Of course, I wouldn't dare work with a text that I didn't feel deeply connected to--I used to speak of my 'umbilical connection' to Lao-tzu. I had discovered the Tao Te Ching shortly before I began Zen training in 1973.\" Later, the querent asks: \"You knew what Lao-tzu was talking about, through direct experience [in Zen meditation] of your own?\" And Mitchell replies: \"That's where my confidence came from.\" Essentially, Mitchell is claiming that his text is authentic because of his felt spiritual connection to its author, rather than it being an accurate translation of the text. But isn't the best translation one that is authentic on multiple levels, emotionally and literally? However, if I had to choose, I'd rather read a translation that is accurate and discover the emotional resonance on my own. Also, FYI: Zen is a school of Buddhism, not Taoist, though it was influenced by Taoism. They share some similar values and qualities, but they are distinct.Mitchell continues: \"There was also the excitement of the aesthetic challenge. Some calculated that by 1986 there were 102 translations of the Tao Te Ching into English alone. I had read six or seven of them, and although I loved the content, the language was mediocre at best: not much poetry in it, not much sparkle. This may sound arrogant too, and irrational. How can you fall in love with a book whose actual words bore you? But that's what happened.\" This sentiment, I think, is the source of all the problems I have with the text. It's completely non-Taoist. If Mitchell had paid attention to even his version of the last chapter, 81, which reads: \"True words aren't eloquent; / eloquent words aren't true,\" he would have seen the folly of his approach. Instead, he decided that he'd rather cut entire paragraphs, rearrange the remaining words, and even alter the meaning to better suit his aesthetic values. His disregard for accuracy and his preference for his concept of beauty over truth not only shows a complete lack of respect for the text, the tradition and its culture of origin; it's also just not scholarly.Another interesting admission made by Mitchell is that he spent only four months writing this version. \"By contrast,\" he says, \"it had taken me seventeen years to finish my translation of the Book of Job. So, obviously, I was getting more focused, or more efficient...\" I disagree with him there--it's not obvious to me that he was any more focused or more efficient. The vast difference in time spent translating Job and rewriting the Tao Te Ching instead tells me that he worked very hard to faithfully render the former and just cobbled together the latter. Mitchell actually reads and understands Hebrew, so it's likely that he was aware of the nuances of the language and therefore understood the importance of accurately rendering the text into English. Mitchell doesn't read any Chinese. If the language is incomprehensible to him, how can he possibly grasp the nuances of the characters in order to accurately translate them for others?This isn't to say that his version is completely wrong. Many sections are fairly accurate (like the line in Ch. 81 that I mentioned above). But there are also many places in his text that are inaccurate to the point of misconstruing the core concepts of the belief system.So if you're new to Taoism and are looking for a translation that accurately communicates Taoist beliefs and sensibilities, I suggest that you go somewhere else. There are many other translations that more accurately render the Tao Te Ching in English. Each has its own particular \"flavor\" and may contain slightly different words or rhythms, but most aim to faithfully present an accurate translation of the text that, while not serving every culture's aesthetic requirements, is very beautiful in its own way and has a lot of wisdom to offer, regardless of cultural and generational differences in taste. Here's a good website to get you started: http://wengu.tartarie.com/wg/wengu.ph... The site provides not only several different translations, but also the original Wang Bi text with translations of each character.If, however, you're already familiar with the Tao Te Ching and other Taoist literature, Mitchell's book at least serves as a good example of Taoism's effect on contemporary American culture."}, {"userName": "7jane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane", "userReview": "(review after rereading:)This book's contents and history have both a sense of vagueness, but not in a bad way, in my opinion. It's somewhat uncertain when it was written (circa 4th-3rd century BC), the author's life details are largely invented, and the existence of the author is not quite certain either (Lao Tzu is just his title, and also it's not known if the text is by one author, or a group of authors worked over some years). It was first translated in the late 1700s, and the oldes existing copy is from circa 300 BC.It's a bit hard to categorise: ethics? religious? philosophy? But really, in my view any of those would do. In a way it felt a bit like Dhammapada, which I've read earlier, in that even if you're not interested in the religion it's part of, it will still appeal, and is a pretty easy a read. I read it quite quickly now.Taoism is clearly put as an opposite way of thinking against Confucianism - which shows in some parts of this text - the latter being based on duties to the community and the family, but somewhat rigidly black and white at its hardest. Taoism is in its end less rigid, putting weight on the coexistence of the opposites, reverence of nature, flexibility and not being too controlling. The Tao is a force in the world, not completely graspable or something one can give a finite meaning, but which balances our world. It is gentleness, avoiding conflict of grasping, seeking peacefulness, simplicity, detachment and humility. Making the point without engaging in rhetoric and arguments.The book's message is simple, the prose spare with plenty of natural imagery. The wisdom (the Tao) of the book is feminine, yin in balance with the yang (while in Confucianism the yang seems sometimes bit heavily-leaned on). The message seems simple, yet is deep. Quite a few sentences bounced out of the text as familiar, things I've seen quoted. Reading and rereading each page will most certainly happen for me in the future. The whole thing reads just like a beautiful ancient Chinese nature painting... and the view is beautiful, peaceful.

I love this book of philosophy. It gives great common sense and helps pave new thought patterns not taught in American culture, paths that lead to peace and sanity. My favorite book of philosophy.12-13-17: Great translation, helped me understand it. My favorite religious/ philosophical book aside from the Christian Bible. Shows a path of peace, contentment and subtle, quiet, managable power. Update, 9/15/17:I found this quote in my notebook, the only one I wrote down. Beautiful.\"Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue this long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure.\"----------------------------------\u201cNothingness cannot be defined; the softest thing cannot be snapped.\u201d \u2013 Bruce LeeMy favorite quote from Bruce Lee, thus far, stretches across this page, above. The quote has reminded me of the power of humility, and the deceptive and dichotomous nature of that power. Humility clothes itself in rags of weakness and frailty but draws superhuman strength, and the Tao Te Ching calls this an empty vessel being filled with another power.Bruce Lee based much of his life and work on the Tao Te Ching, so I read it. I admire this amazing and deeply profound piece of religious literature. The philosophy coincides with my own faith. I hear echoes of teachings I\u2019ve heard in Christianity. The book teaches, as already mentioned, the power of humility. It teaches the value of things considered meaningless, such as empty space. We build houses, form rooms with four walls, but the basis of this structure lies upon the importance of the empty space. Empty space provides room to live, to breathe, to walk, to make love, to work. The author also likens the paradox (and there are many, sometimes frustrating paradoxes, confirming the understanding can\u2019t be grasped in one simple read) to that of the empty space between the spokes of a wheel. The power and mechanics of a wheel depend on the empty space. Thus, we consider worthless things, abased things, as meaningless. We say we live life to the fullest when we have what we want, and when we lose it all, we have no meaning, no purpose, no life. The book attempts to explain this. Balance. The Yin-Yang. The point of the argument concludes with something underlying the whole of existence. One constant, the Tao. I like to think of this, in my personal paradigm of faith, as God. The book says Tao came before the existence of God, which I believe refers to man\u2019s interpretation or attempt to understand God. The Tao exists as the fundamental, underlying essence of the universe. Above the Tao, we have the evidence of \u201clife,\u201d the events, the good, the bad, acceptance, rejection, bliss, pain, heaven, hell, male, female \u2013 you get it. Under all these events we also have a soul, eternal and unchanging in nature.The book changed my perspective. I\u2019ve recently divorced. As I experience grief, the thoughts come: life has no purpose now. Right now, in the present situation, I\u2019m in a low, one side of the Yin-Yang. If I look back, and as Sarah Mclachlan says, \u201cdon\u2019t let life pass [me] by; hold on to the memories,\u201d I see the whole Yin-Yang, the whole balance, the beauty, the essence of life itself. I see a proud mother, her warm, soft hand holding mine as she says, \u201cLord, we come now to the throne of God.\u201d I see a shriveled woman with tubes in her nostrils taking final breaths and slurring the words, \u201cMy son.\u201d I see triumph as a child pitching a no-hitting season of baseball. I see my mother\u2019s tears, and hear her weeping as we came home from my first attempt and fail at college (because of partying). I see a Father who loves me, and plays baseball with me, fishes with me. I see a father choking to hold back tears by my mother\u2019s casket. The high, the low. The wave. Up, down, up, down. I see a beautiful lady with sea-blue eyes lying on my chest of happiness. I see a house I\u2019m leaving as I gather my last things, and a baby-dog I\u2019ll never see again, crying upstairs because Daddy\u2019s going away and he knows I won\u2019t return to walk him again. See it all. See life. See the beauty, the lesson. See the tenderness of a mother deer licking her baby. See the lion chasing and biting the bleeding neck of her prey. See it all. This is life. The wonder, the blessing. Life. We live. We experience. The experiences only flow through a constant medium, us. I believe we exist in a timeless place called soul, and this place holds it all, the good and bad, in memories. We extend from the underlying Principle, the \u201cTao,\u201d or some call it the Universe, some God. I believe this God has a face and He wants to be seen.The author points out the paradox of softness. He refers to women as feminine, or weak, but then turns to say weakness stands stronger than strength, because strength depends on the weakness, as the walls depend on the space for meaning. He says maturity is the end, the death, and Tao has no place with this. When we master something, it ends. A full-grown tree has only to be full-grown, and eventually wither. A new tree has begun to grow, and has a softness, and in this potential to grow, most of life abounds, because the process has just begun.My end becomes a new beginning, always, so long as air feeds oxygen into my lungs and body."}, {"userName": "RK-ique", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8930751-rk-ique", "userReview": "This version of the Dao De Jing, translated by Richard John Lynn, is highly recommended to those who are not looking for the touchy feely Laozi. Rather it is a translation for those interested in ancient Chinese thought. A wonderful translation.The Dao De Jing was probably written, by author or authors unknown, in the fourth century B.C.E. and \"is primarily addressed to the ruler who would be a sage-king and is mainly concerned with achieving the good society through harmony with nature....\". This version includes an interpretation of the text written by Wang Bi (226-49 C.E.) not long before his premature death. Both Wang Bi and the translator or this edition, Richard John Lynn, have maintained the original intent of the Dao De Jing in not bringing in any mystical or religious concepts, which by Wang Bi's time were part of the popular view of Daoism.In reading this version, I perceive more clearly than in most versions three strands of thought. (I acknowledge that this thing may be sliced in many other ways. See for example Michael Lafarge's quite good translation.) The first strand is basically a description of how the sage-ruler behaves/develops, 'De' (virtue, potential). The second strand is a guide to self cultivation, how to become a sage, and the third is an articulation of the basis for the other strands (and everything else, 'the myriad of things'), the 'Tao'(the nature of the universe). These strands are not kept discrete but are, rather, presented as a synthesis.As noted above, both Wang Bi and Lynn have avoided mystical language with the result that many of the terms with which readers of other translations are familiar are translated differently. Thus: \"wuwei\" usually translated as \"no action\" is here presented as \"no conscious effort\". The effect of this is important in that \"no action\" suggests that the agent accomplishes ends by doing nothing, a mystical concept which captures the modern reader's imagination. The words \"no conscious effort\" suggests more of a lack of purpose. The ruler acts but not to his own ends but rather in accordance with the unfolding nature of the universe, the Tao. To act out of the Tao is to act out of nothingness, as opposed to acting out of the myriad of things which will mislead and lead to disaster. Wang Bi begins his introduction to the work with \"The way things come into existence and efficacy comes about is that things arise from the formless and efficacy emanates from the nameless. The formless and the nameless [Dao] is the progenitor of the myriad of things.\". I tend to view this as I do the concept of the \"big bang' in popular physics. There is nothing there and then there is an explosion out of which all that exists emanates. The \"Dao\" is the ever expanding universe and everything that exists and happens within it. (This last bit is totally my own fabrication to put the concept into terms which I can grasp. It works for me for now.)Thus, the Dao is conceived of as coming out of nothing and as ever changing. It cannot be named because it does not exist as a thing. It has no form or substance and is always becoming. It cannot be known. To act in accordance with it is therefore to act according to the changing universe as an unfolding, not as a thing to be learned.The process of becoming a sage is thus a process of coming to be aware of how the Dao unfolds. To know the essence of the Dao is to know that it is empty, that it is nothing. To understand this is to be 'authentic'. I struggled with Lynn's translation of \"zhen\" as 'authentic' because of the connotations carried by that English term, especially as we use it in terms of 'being authentic to the self'. Lafargue translates \"Zhen\" as 'genuineness' which, for me, carries the same meaning but without the same connotations. \"Zhen\" is used to refer to the relation to the emptiness of the Dao. One thus becomes 'authentic', not by aligning one's life with the self, but by developing an ever-changing, ever-becoming self that moves with the Dao and thus acts with the Dao. The sage-king is one who rules with the Dao by taking action only within the emptiness of the Dao. In other words, the sage-king goes with the flow.This a very different way of conceiving of the world and how we react within it. Unlike Western thinkers, the ancient Chinese thinkers did not value learning about the world. Nor did they look to an afterlife, ancestors or gods to bring their lives into accord with the universe.

Unfortunately, I have little experience reading books indirectly, so I found this a difficult book to read, end even more difficult to discern what was being said by the author. A friend told me that he thought Heraclitus, the Greek pre-Socratic philosopher, was somewhat like Lao Tzu. Heraclitus said \"you can't step in the same river twice\". He believed that reality was a flux composed of a unity of opposites. I suppose it is possible to consider Lao Tzu's \"the way\" in this manner and see it as a unifying force. I liken it to the ancient Greek notion of substance that underlies all things but does not have a separate existence. The Tao te Ching seems to suggest action is good, except when inaction is required; that it is good to experience things with an open mind, but do not become too attached to one way of looking at reality for it may suddenly be going in the other direction. In other words, it is difficult to determine exactly what this book is saying, especially when it suggests that words cannot describe the way; thus the way is not that which is called by that name (don't worry - I don't know what that means either). The best thing about the Tao te Ching is that the act of reading it stirs your mind, gets you thinking about deep questions and others. That alone makes it worth the effort, even though it may take a lifetime to make some progress toward answers.Perhaps it is appropriate to turn to a twentieth century poet and thinker for some Tao-like advice. Here is a stanza from \"Burnt Norton\"At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.T.

Too many changes over the past few days that I couldn't summon the will to write as I had intended to. To bring a little peace, I opened my journal to write and my eyes fell to the last line I'd written, the line I've quoted from Tao Te Ching, and it almost magically assuaged the tremors of my mind. Whether Lao Tzu was a real person is uncertain. D. C. Lau, whose splendid introduction and notes I cannot commend enough for the ease of understanding it provides a lay person, surmises that this may just be an anthology of aphorisms. Lau reveals the synthesis behind his interpretation frequently, giving the reader a sense of The mystery behind the origin adds to the endearing quality of this work. It is very kind and this kindness can be attributed to no one in particular. Perhaps this work is more of a guide to governance than a broad philosophical treatise. This work is from the Warring States period so it also possible that any work of philosophy could not ignore the demands of the time. The principle subject is that of 'the way'.\nThe way that can be spoken of (1)Is not the constant wayThe name that can be namedIs not the constant name\nThere is an allure of something as pervasive and fleeting as the Tao, in theory. In practice, acceptance of the idea is daunting task. Some ideas subvert conventionally held notions of strength by exposing it's limitations.\nA man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead. Grass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shrivelled when dead. Thus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death; The supple and the weak are the comrades of life. (182)Therefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish; (183)A tree that is strong will suffer the axe.\n Reading Guha's India after Gandhi makes me think that any organized society in the present day can only thrive by killing the individual a little but the lofty ideas of Tao Te Ching speak of a different kind of leader who could ask, Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned? There is a great divide between the leaders who are sought today and what the Tao Te Ching recommends, that it seems unattainable but it is a vision that helps see the pitfalls of the kind of leaders upheld today. \nThe best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to his subjects. (39)When his task is accomplished and his work done (41)The people all say, \u2018It happened to us naturally.\u2019\n This is a book of ideas, and while I cannot grasp several, I hope to entertain them often.--July 11, 2015"}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/246177-rob", "userReview": "highlights:3 - not collecting treasures prevents stealing.13- accept disgrace willingly23- he who does not trust will not be trusted46- he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough57- the more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers there will belowlights: eh, pretty much the whole translation. i guess this version is popular because it has nice calligraphy of the original chinese and BW photos of nature accompanying the english translation. but despite not having read any of the other translations, i'm pretty sure this one is pretty bad. there is an essay by the editor at the end, where she tells the story of how the book came to be, 25 years ago, and she admits that she knows no chinese, and what she did was read the author's proposed translation, then read 12 other published translations of the same line, then try to write something that had the author's idea but sounded different from the other 12 versions. that came as no surprise to me. many, many lines read exactly like someone had gone through a thesaurus and chosen not the best word, or the second best, but yeah, about the 13th best word for the situation. clunkity clunk. that's how i wrote social studies essays in fifth grade. go through the encyclopedia and try to write the same thing but change a bunch of words. one day i will definitely read another version."}, {"userName": "Jo\u00e3o Fernandes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28882833-jo-o-fernandes", "userReview": "An ode to apathy as a means of utopia.
