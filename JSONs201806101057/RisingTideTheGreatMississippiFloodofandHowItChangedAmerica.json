We get the history of the Mississippi Delta and of the efforts to tame the river, still a work in progress. He shows how the politics of Mississippi and Louisiana were shaped by the river and how the river\u2019s turmoil spread to Washington even determining who would be president. We learn about the plantation sharecropping system of the 1920\u2019s in the Delta and how the Great Flood of 1927 showed Delta blacks were essentially treated as still slaves. He tells the stories of people whose fate was tied to the fortunes of the river: Engineers James Eads and Andrew Humphries, generations of Percys from the ante-bellum Delta plantation founder to the end of the bloodline in 1941, the behind the scenes power brokers in New Orleans, and the engineer who rode the river to the White House, Herbert Hoover. The Delta area between the Mississippi River and the Yazoo River is a fertile alluvial plain centered on Greenville, MS. An early 19th century traveler described it as, \u201ca jungle equal to any in Africa\u201d. In 1841 Charles Percy left Alabama with his belongings including slaves to take advantage of the rich soil. His slaves cleared the land and started growing cotton. His plantation would switch to the sharecropping system after the war and continue on much the same for succeeding generations.With development came the problem of controlling the frequent floods, a problem for the entire river system that drained an area from Montana to Georgia, from New York to New Mexico. In the 19th century two engineers, James Eads and Andrew Humphries fought over flood control policy. The self-made Eads was brilliant, but Humphries felt his authority as head of the Army Corps of Engineers was threatened. In the end this led Humphries and his successors to oppose Eads proposals and adopt a system of levees doomed to fail.By 1927 when the Great Flood occurred, Leroy Percy was ruling his share cropped plantation as well as Greenville and Washington County. He was a United States Senator and powerful in the region, well connected through club memberships and social connections to those who controlled Louisiana politics in New Orleans. Percy and his friends would face tough choices in the flood. Greenville and the Delta plantations would be destroyed with lasting consequences. The plantations needed the black tenants to be profitable. As the river swelled, whites rounded up blacks at gunpoint and forced them to work without pay to build up the levees. After the levees failed, the same white landlords used their guns to keep blacks from leaving, desperately needing them to rebuild and replant. But in the years following, dissatisfaction with their treatment during the flood caused over 50% of blacks to leave Washington County. They joined the Great Migration to the North and the Delta plantations would never return to their former grandeur.New Orleans was spared as its power brokers took no chances in protecting their investments in the city. They decided to dynamite the levee protecting St Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes on the other side of the river to reduce its level. They did this despite the advice of river experts that this was needless since so many other levees would naturally fail and spare New Orleans anyway, which is what happened. But they went ahead and everything in the two parishes was wiped out. The city\u2019s bankers and politicians had promised reimbursement for damages to the residents of the two parishes. But predictably they reneged on most of their promises and the livelihoods of the residents were destroyed. Huey Long used the ill will created by this disregard for the common people to win election as governor. He broke up the old power network of bankers and businessmen who had for so long operated secretly through their elite clubs and social connections to control Louisiana.Another politician to benefit and benefit immensely was Herbert Hoover who as Secretary of Commerce under Calvin Coolidge got the job he wanted leading the relief effort, something he had done for Wilson in Europe after WWI. An engineer and great organizer but not a gifted politician, he was still able to control the press and the people involved to make himself look like a hero. Even though he was often disingenuous, especially with blacks, he crafted an image of stellar competence leading to his landslide victory in the 1928 presidential race. Largely disliked by those in his party who had worked with him, without the flood he would never have been even considered for the nomination. While clever, he was not a good listener and always thought he knew best, an attitude that would soon cost him dearly when he faced the Great Depression. I haven\u2019t commented much on the flood itself and Barry gives a dramatic account. It was huge completely inundating an area equal to the states of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut combined, it lasted for months, and it was devastating. But to me the real story was how the river itself had always been addressed through the lens of politics and how it answered back taking out the political elites in its path, electing a new governor and even deciding who would be president. That was the real power of the river."}, {"userName": "happy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9369133-happy", "userReview": "I found this a fantastic look at both the geology/hydrology of the Mississippi River and the society that grew around its delta. Mr. Barry does a very commendable job of exploring both the problems and advantages of living next to the longest river in North America.The author starts out the narrative by exploring the attempts to tame the Mississippi Riven the late 19th Century and the rivalry that developed between two men \u2013 Gen Andrew Humphreys \u2013 head of the Army\u2019s Engineer Department and a self-taught engineer and Mississippi expert James Eads. The class of egos between these two men and what it did to the theories of channeling the river and delta is very well done. Gen Humphreys comes off by far the worse in comparison. He is depicted as not willing to give an inch to Eads and feeling that not only is he right, but Eads doesn\u2019t know a thing about the river.Eads theories are rooted in his experiences as both a river pilot and a man who salvages river wrecks and their cargos. This includes actually walking on the river bottom. The two theories can mainly be summed in levees vs jetties. The levee to hold the river in its channel and the jetties to help the river scour a new channel. It discussing the river, Mr. Berry also looks at how the river dug it channel, the shear amount of water and silt the river carries at any one time, the nature of the Delta and exactly how big it is (almost up to the Mississippi/Arkansas border). One fact that struck me is that from Vicksburg, Miss down to the mouth of the river that river bottom is actually below sea level and the water at the bottom of the river has no reason to keep on moving and the affect this has on the hydrology of the river.The next section of the narrative looks at the Percy family of the upper Delta. In looking at the Percy family, the author looks at their, for the times, liberal attitude in race relations. This does not mean that they had the same ideals of race relations as modern people, but the Percy\u2019s went out of their way to see blacks in their county educated \u2013 the Greenville (the power base of the Percy family) public schools spent more money per black student that the rest of the state spent per student on white children, suppress lynching and they treated their share croppers fairly. The author also looks at Leroy Percy\u2019s, the last Senator from Mississippi to be selected by the State Legislature, fight to expel the KKK from Greenville in particular and Northern Miss in general. The author relates ones episode in Greenville where a white man who attempted to lynch one of the black residents was himself lynched. The impression this section left with me is that the Percy family in general and LeRoy in particular were not particularly racist, but more of a classist, ie everyone has his/her place is society and should stay there.In addition to Percy\u2019s the author looks a New Orleans and who were the power brokers in the city. It wasn\u2019t the elected officials. In discussing the power brokers he also looks at how bigotry and antisemitism gradually took hold in the power welding circles in New Orleans.As the author tells the story of the people living in the Delta, the power of the Mississippi is always in the background. There had been several major floods in the two generations preceding the 1927 flood and one of the items Mr. Berry discusses is the growth of the levee system and the actual size the levees themselves. As the flood waters rise, the attempts to protect the levees and raise them is extremely well done. He also does a good job of explaining how a levee fails. It's not just from water overlapping the levee, but the river can undermine also. This section looks at how principles and people can be overcome by events. During the '27 flood, the need for labor on the levees even the Percys resort to the whole sale conscription of black men, sometimes literally at gunpoint, to work on the levees with almost no compensation and with white foremen, really echoing the conditions of the antebellum southern plantations. Some this is a really hard read.  Mr. Berry also looks at how the power brokers in New Orleans (NO) conned the people of two parrishes south of the city to blow their levees in an attempt to save the city. In order to get the buy in of the leadership of the two affected parrishes, the men of NO promised to fully compensate the people of the parishes for their monetary losses. To put is simply, after the floods subsided NO decided to play hard ball with the compensation and Mr. Berry supposes this led directly to the rise of Huey Long. One of the sad things about this story is that the levees didn't have to be breeched. The river started to recede the day before they were dynamited.In looking at the flood in general, Herbert Hoover and the Federal Government\u2019s role in fighting the flood is explored. At the time all flood control was the responsibility of the states, after the flood legislation was passed in Congress make flood control on the Mississippi the responsibility of the Federal Gov\u2019t. Mr. Barry opines that this laid the intellectual basis for FDR\u2019s wholesale involvement in the economy during the Great Depression. He also states that Hoover\u2019s work during the crisis led directly to his succeeding Coolidge as president of the US.All in all this is a very good look at a pivotal moment in US history. I would rate this 4.25 if GR allowed, so I\u2019ve rounded down."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda", "userReview": "This book explains many issues that I never understood from my basic \"public-school-history-class-taught-by-a-coach\" years. When did blacks defect from the Republican party, the party of Lincoln, and flock to the Democrat party? Why did they do that? When did the federal government first step in to organize help after a disaster where before local communities were on their own?I have read John Barry's other book on \"The Great Influenza\", and found it to be an absolutely excellent book. This book is only slightly less gripping, but that is because the influenza book had doctors in it, and I've always been partial to medicine and physicians. This book has engineers, my second favorite group of people, so it stands a close second now.Measured from the head of the Missouri RIver, the Mississippi river is the longest river in the world. It stretches from Canada in the north to the Gulf of Mexico in the south, then from New York and North Carolina in the east to Idaho and New Mexico in the west. The Mississippi River valley is 20% larger than China's Yellow River, twice as big as the Nile river in Egypt and twice as big as the Ganges in India; 15 times larger than the Rhine in Europe. Only the Amazon river (barely) and the Congo have larger drainage basins than the Mississippi River.Controlling the river so that it serves the purpose of man has been a huge engineering project since the mid-1800's. How to control it.... with levees? with cut-throughs? with reservoirs? A combination? The first part of the book deals with two engineers who would decide the control and method of management of the river. James Buchanan Eads was one of the most brilliant engineers of all time, ranked by the deans of American engineering colleges with da Vinci and Edison. Andrew Atkinson Humphreys was the other Union soldier / engineer from the Army Corps of Engineers. A bitter rivalry between these two men eventually caused the formation of a committee to determine which method proposed by the two men would determine how the Mississippi River would be managed. True to form, the committee selected the worst components of each man's recommendation, and selected a solution that neither man would ever have wanted, a \"levees only\" solution.Levees restrict the river to flow between them. Cut offs are a way of straightening the river by cutting through the S bend's created naturally. Reservoirs were a way to capture runoff flood waters and direct them into man-made lakes. The levees only policy set up the river to amass the largest level of flooding ever recorded in the 1927 flood. New Orleans, the origins and politics, are explained in fairly great detail in this book. It was settled not by immigrants, but by blue-blooded families of importance who came to the area because of the amazing availability to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. Immigrants and former slaves made up a huge portion of the people in the area, but the city itself was ruled and ruled very efficiently by an elite cadre of families. Because of James Eads who established man-made jetties that kept the mouth of the Mississippi River clear of sandbars, New Orleans became a stable port and very prosperous city. So when the 1927 flood threatened New Orleans, a deal was struck by the elite New Orleans rulers to dynamite the levees of downriver St. Bernard parish and Plaquemines Parish. These two parishes were much poorer than New Orleans and the \"deal\" struck was that the city of New Orleans and the city elite would pay back damages to the people impacted. The levees there were dynamited, the surrounding areas were flooded, but reparations to the affected people became a legal nightmare. City officials backed away from their promises, the city elite also backed away from their promises. People in the area eventually fought back with their votes, and the unrest in the area brought in a new political group, one led by Huey Long instead of the elite families. In answer to the questions I raised above, here are the answers I found.Blacks defected from the Republican Party after Herbert Hoover was elected president in 1928. Hoover had worked as the Secretary of Commerce during the 1927 flood and during the aftermath. His efficient organization of aid to the area would keep his name in newspapers and before the public in such a way that he received the Republican nomination for the 1928 election. Hoover had worked with Robert Russa Moton, head of the Tuskegee Institute after Booker T. Washington died, to provide accountability for the relief effort among blacks. Moton was led to believe by Hoover that he (Hoover) would provide a means for blacks to sharecrop in the areas controlled by the New Orleans elite families. Hoover deceived Moton, and as a result lost the votes of those blacks affected adversely by the 1927 flood. Blacks left the south in huge numbers, and many from the Mississippi / Louisiana / New Orleans area moved to Chicago.Herbert Hoover, as Secretary of Commerce organizing relief efforts for the 1927 flood, was the first to request that the Federal Government step in to organize things that were too big for the local states and communities. The 1927 flood simply overwhelmed southern states in scope of devastation and need to get an influx of cash to rebuild. Calvin Coolidge, who was president at the time, resisted strongly in committing the Federal Government to such activities. But eventually pressure from the local communities, the states affected, and those political machines who sought to re-establish governance of those areas along different lines, prevailed. And thus, the 1927 Mississippi River flood became THE FIRST disaster where the federal government stepped in to organize and provide disaster relief. In the past, natural disasters were dealt with by those communities and states that were affected. But after 1927, that precedent was changed, amazingly enough against the wishes of the President of the United States and most of Congress!An interesting aside..... the head of the New Orleans Weather Bureau was Isaac Cline. Those of you who have read \"Isaac's Story\" about the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, will remember his name. He was head of the Galveston Weather Bureau when the hurricane practically destroyed Galveston. Cline's wife and unborn child died in the Galveston Hurricane. He was able to rescue his 3 daughters. As a sort of \"demotion\" in the Weather Bureau, he was sent to New Orleans, where he served well although without enthusiasm for the area. To the credit of Cline, he fairly and accurately reported river surges and provided warnings to those along the Mississippi River during the 1927 flood. I am reading \"Isaac's Storm\" also right now, and was amazed that he also played a part in this event!"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1928315-jim", "userReview": "Don\u2019t let the title fool you, while the focus of the book is the great 1927 flood (an event overlooked today), this is a book about the Mississippi River and man\u2019s attempt to live with and in some cases tame it. Full of rich descriptions of men and women whose lives were shaped by the river and the 1927 flood, and of powerful men who tried to control and profit from it, including one who became President, this book really grabs you from the outset.Starting with early attempts to erect bridges over it, to map its courses and devise ways to keep it from hampering economic growth in the Mississippi Delta, through its role during the Civil War, and how it affected economics, culture and race relations in the south, the Mississippi River itself is a character in this story, with a personality all its own. This is expertly brought to life by Barry.Most fascinating for me was the many ways in which the 1927 flood so profoundly changed the character of the deep south, and how in many ways it set back nascent progress on race relations. In order to combat the flood blacks were forced to work, shoring up levees, hauling supplies and digging trenches, all at gunpoint and without adequate food and shelter to sustain themselves. In many places (particularly Greenville, MS which in many ways was the epicenter of the flood), white leaders, aided and abetted by the Red Cross virtually re-instituted slavery. Prior to the flood, through the cooperation of local blacks and the relatively enlightened views of its leaders, particularly LeRoy Percy (a central figure in the latter half of the book), race relations had seen improvement. The flood, and the reaction of the white leadership to it nearly destroyed all that.It also profoundly reshaped the labor system in the South. One reason why white leaders were so eager to keep blacks under foot during the crisis was to prevent them from leaving the Delta where they were the primary source of labor. However, once the waters had receded and it became apparent promises of restitution from local leaders and from the federal government were not going to be forthcoming, many blacks began migrating to the north. This caused a huge problem for large landowners who relied on the labor blacks provided, and from their percentage of income from sharecropper activities. It certainly helped hasten the transition to a de facto free labor system which had only existed in name only up until that time; a transition that continues to be a very painful one for the region.Also interesting is the affect the flood had on presidential politics, and on the eventual shift in the relation between the federal government and her citizens that we saw under President Franklin Roosevelt. Herbert Hoover, Calvin Coolidge\u2019s Commerce Secretary of Commerce was tasked to coordinate the government response to the flood. It was his work, and the positive press he received from it that propelled him to the White House.Hoover was tasked by Coolidge to coordinate the efforts of mostly private organizations as they attempted to deal with the enormous human suffering that was the result of the flood. Coolidge himself refused to set what he considered a dangerous precedent by providing the type of government disaster relief we take for granted today. As a result he was the focus of extensive media and public criticism for what was viewed as a heartless reaction to the crisis. All the while Hoover was being lionized in the press as the only member of the administration willing to do something about the crisis. Coolidge\u2019s opposition to government relief, however, was a policy with which Hoover totally agreed. It also foreshadowed the disastrous way he reacted to the Great Depression.In hindsight the resources brought to bear by Hoover were wholly inadequate, and in many case failed to provide even minimally adequate relief. It was this same strategy that he used as President, to try and relieve the suffering experienced by so many during the Great Depression; a strategy that failed miserably and gave rise to FDR and the more active governmental role he implemented. It was also the beginning of the end of the alliance between African-Americans and the Republican Party.I found very little to criticize in this book. Occasionally Barry provided a bit more detail, particularly about financial matters, than was probably necessary to make his point, but that is a minor quibble. Overall highly valuable book, about a significant even in American history that is often overlooked.

The 1927 flood of the Mississippi River may have been the worst natural disaster in terms of people displaced and society destroyed that America has ever faced; it quite simply dwarfs Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The author details the battles over man's often futile attempts to control the Mississippi; the rich and racist white society that controlled the Deep South and their attempts to preserve that society through the subjugation of Black Americans trapped in tenant farming, nothing but a legalized form of slavery.The author also shows the rise of Herbert Hoover, the so-called Great Humanitarian, who in reality was selfish, grabbing, bigoted and racist. Finally, the author documents the acceleration of the Great Black Migration, the splitting of Black Americans from the Republican Party, and the slow and inexorable decline of New Orleans."}, {"userName": "Bonnie Huval", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3571025-bonnie-huval", "userReview": "This is one of the most powerful books I've ever read.

Although like most popular history books today its subtitle contains the words \"...and How It Changed America,\" the most interesting and extensive part of the book actually deals with the background to the flood. Barry tells the amazing story of the Mississippi Delta, which, due to its association with the Blues, I had always assumed was a particularly backward and racist region. Turns out that one semi-benevolent planter family (the Percys, descended from Harry Hotspur in Henry IV's time) made the area a peculiar bastion of racial tolerance in the Reconstructed South. In defiance of all trends, black officeholders in the Delta continued to hold office, black-owned farms were relatively common (at one point 2/3s of all farms in the Delta were owned by blacks), and lynchings were relatively rare (there were only two during the whole era in the Delta's Washington County, and one involved whites lynching another white for killing a black man!).Barry also tells the amazing backstory to New Orleans' disastrous and unnecessary decision to flood St. Bernard's Parish to protect itself from the rising waters. He manages to describe the unbelievably inbred high society that was able to use its control of the newspapers to clamp down all coverage of the flood, to threaten those who \"fearmongered,\" and to run the town through a couple of male social clubs and Mardi Gras \"krewes\" while the mayor and other elected officials merely watched. This was oligarchy at its most blatant, but its decisions would anger the rural population of Louisiana enough for them to throw their votes tp rabble-rouser Huey Long.The flood itself is actually the most boring part of the book. Tides are constantly rising, houses are constantly crushed, cows are constantly drowned, but Hoover's purblind mismanagement of the relief efforts does provide an amazing story (he started \"reconstruction corporations\" to try to revive the region with cheap loans long before his 1932 presidential \"Reconstruction Finance Corporation.\" Both were largely ignored by those they were intended to assist).There's much more: about the engineers' battle over levees versus jetties in the 1880s, about local fights with the Klan, about Mississippi politics. Almost all of it is fascinating. This book deserves all the lavish praise it has received."}, {"userName": "Jacob Aitken", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5958504-jacob-aitken", "userReview": "John Barry begins his story with a prologue that describes a quasi-aristocratic party held near the Mississippi River with the threat of a flood hanging overhead.

The prologue leaves the reader hanging wondering the importance of the men and the relevance over whether the levees hold. In the following pages, Barry outlines his thesis as this: the 1927 Mississippi River flood changed the political, economic, and social structures in America, and how man's pride in controlling nature and was a failure.The Reviewer's AnalysisI would commend Barry for his historical venture into the Mississippi River country. Barry was at times biased in his approach, but he did keep this to a minimum and did not let it deter his story. An example would be the dynamiting of the levee: Barry implies that this was unnecessary; however, he does so in only a few areas. Barry gives almost seventy pages of documentation at the end of the book for the reader to check his work. The book's most compelling aspect in my opinion was the first section describing the engineering theory and the ensuing political battles. Its greatest shortcoming was jumping from city to city throughout the book. I also am curious as to whether the destruction of St. Bernard Parish in the twenties impeded the progress of the parish at the present time, but that is perhaps beyond the scope of this work. Overall I would recommend this work to anyone living near a river and has fought floods in the past. No doubt they can sympathize with the trials and triumphs of those who battled the flood. I believe they would find it enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Eric_W", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w", "userReview": "This is a fascinating book about the enormous flood that inundated much of the Mississippi basin in 1927. In fact, the flood covered an areas greater than several northeastern states combined. The flood stretched from Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico, and in some places the water was thirty feet deep. In a nation of 120 million, over one million were left homeless.The reasons for the flood were numerous: a river policy that emerged from the hatred of two engineers (James Eads and Andrew Humphreys) for each other and brought untold wealth to the planters of the Yazoo-Mississippi delta. The social impact was enormous and resulted, in part, for the black immigration north.Weeks of nothing but rain culminated in an incredible storm on April 12th that dumped record amounts of rainfall in a very short period of time. As comparison, the flood of 1993 filled the Mississippi at St. Louis so it was moving one million cubic feet of water per second. In 1927, just before the levees broke, the river was moving three times that.The battle between Eads and Humphreys concerned how to best control the river: outlets for excess water to accumulate, or levees to channel the increased flow. Levees create their own dynamic. If they are built on both sides of the river, the cause the river to move faster, the theory being that the faster flow will scour the river deeper. This does not always occur so levees often have to be built higher. A four-story levee breaking has the same effect as the rupture of a dam. Barry writes well and takes you right into the midst of the political battles and their outcome."}, {"userName": "blue-collar mind", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/635646-blue-collar-mind", "userReview": "Well, well here we are again. Another hot summer has started and water is rising down South. At least this time we're not at the mercy of the Army Corps-oh wait. Hmmm. (Pack your paperwork, I beseech you my river neighbors.Just in case.)However, it is true that the earthen levee system of the Mississippi is much more substantial and a SYSTEM rather than the concrete pieces that were built on peat moss and sand along the canals of our Lake Pontchartrain and Industrial Canal here in New Orleans. We can be reasonably sure that the Corps will not kill thousands of people this month, mostly because this is a 100 year project and it is not dependent entirely on the current political system or money spent in post-capitalist America.If you want to understand the breadth of this system I can most surely recommend this book to you. It's a page turner too, full of characters and politics and yes rising tides.I'll tell you the best way for me to tell you how good the book is.

I expected to learn much about the 1927 Mississippi River flood, but Barry's book has a much wider scope. It begins with the stories of the 19th-century engineers who knew the river intimately, and how their disagreements set the stage for devastation in the 20th century. By the end of the book, Barry has clearly set forth the ways in which the flood changed our country - in terms of public policy, racial politics, populist politics, even why New Orleans continues to be a culturally rich but economically backwards city.And the chapters on the flood itself are as tense, gripping, and sometimes horrifying as any great novel.

The valuable information and perspective packed into the book's 500+ pages are completely worth the investment, and apply meaningfully to today's world on so many levels.

I was expecting some historic accounts of individuals that dealt with the flood of 1927, some first hand accounts of the devestation, and maybe some information on the faulty engineering beliefs and theories of the day that lead to such a terrible flood. Well, it included a lot of that but it included oh so much more! To be honest, I almost put this book down and passed on it. But I decided to stick it out a little longer just to see what came of it. Am I glad I did!! This book is so much more than harrowing stories and backgrounds of poor people that dealt with the calamity. This is a book that reveals so much about the lives and times of the people in the Mississippi Delta and of New Orleans and many others on the Mississippi River and of the engineers that tried to contain the river and believe it or not, so much about the shaping of American Politics during this era and the rise of Herbert Hoover to prominence and eventually his presidential election, all due to the horrible flood of 1927. This book covers in depth, the power broker businessmen that formed and shaped government policies in the effected states, all to help themselves and their industries and the government puppets that played along with them. Including how the governor of Louisiana was bullied into blasting away a levee causing flooding of homes and businesses in one parish to protect the interest of the businessmen in New Orleans when in fact it wasn't even in much danger due to all the levee breaks further north on the river. Also, the early engineering rivals of Humphries and Eads, as well as others, on the most effective ways to control the river and keep it from flooding. The creation of the Army Corp of Engineers and how it evolved including mismanagement due to jealousy, rivalry, ego, and just plain old ineptness at it's worst. And the most horrible part of it all is the treatment and abuse of the black population in the delta, the sharecroppers or, as in most cases just laborers, and how they were treated like slaves during and after the flooding occurred, how they were at the mercy of these same power broker businessmen that didn't want them to leave the area so they made sure they couldn't . If the blacks let the delta there would be no laborers to harvest the sugar cane or work the farms so it was priority to keep them there no matter how what suffering they went through and how even the Red Cross was used against them to help ensure they would stay put in the delta. This is a well researched and in depth book about the early development of the delta and the lasting effects the flood of 1927 had not just on that region but in all of America."}, {"userName": "Rob Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58133181-rob-rogers", "userReview": "This epic (and it really is an epic) describes the causes, events and effects of the great Mississippi flood of 1927, which devastated hundreds of thousands of people throughout the South and Midwest.

The story is well-organized and like the river itself, moves along at a relentless pace."}, {"userName": "Nell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/558699-nell", "userReview": "The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 is an excellent backdrop to highlight how American society has changed over the decades; how institutions, including governments, work, or don\u2019t work; and how nature will eventually win over human endeavors. First, nature. Despite the descriptions of cubic feet per second of water flow or how many square miles were inundated or the sheer size of the levees, I have difficulty comprehending the extent and force of the Mississippi River and its drainage basin (third, and almost second, largest in the world), how wild it was before efforts to control it started, and the damage caused when it flooded. Decades of bad decisions about flood control have shown that nature is ultimately ungovernable, that it is wiser to work with nature than to conquer it. This has public policy implications for the government\u2019s issuing flood insurance and allowing building or rebuilding in flood plains or coastal areas, or for that matter in areas prone to wildfires or mudslides. Obviously we haven\u2019t learned that lesson, since people are trying to rebuild in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in areas that will become even more subject to damaging storms in the future.Which leads to the topic of how institutions work or fail to work. From the beginning, flood control efforts along the Mississippi suffered from scientific and personal rivalries that became political. These led to the \u201clevees-only\u201d policies which increased, not decreased, the flooding and were finally proved wrong in the 1927 flood. The Army Corps of Engineers should have had the best and brightest, yet they lacked engineers with hydrological training and experience and were as subject to political infighting as any other body. But the state of Ohio managed to construct a system of reservoirs that proved successful. What worked in Ohio that didn\u2019t happen in Washington, DC, or the Delta? The power structure of the Mississippi Delta and the city of New Orleans was another example of how things get done. Social and business leaders (mostly but not completely overlapping groups, and many of them bankers) formed committees, even met in secret, wrote up plans, and informed the elected officials of the actions they should rubber stamp. They were able to control what the New Orleans newspapers published and even to some extent national newspapers. Barry says this \u201cwas not atypical in the America of the time\u201d though more blatant in New Orleans than elsewhere. Ultimately it caused its own downfall, as the social ostracism of newcomers caused major companies to bypass the city and locate their headquarters elsewhere in the Gulf, demoting NO to a city of historical interest and tourism but lacking economic vitality. I found resonance for today in the extreme deference shown to Wall Street in the setting of public policy and the influence that the ability to make unrestrained political contributions affords this group.Which raises the question of where power comes from and how public sentiment changes what we expect from government. Yes, power comes from money and social influence, but Hoover recognized that advertising and public relations could shift public opinion effectively. He was able to parlay his genius for organizing disaster relief into the presidency. He was not above using people and reneging on promises, as the planters had done in the Delta, to get what he wanted. (The whole interplay of the conflicting interests of different groups and what people did to get things accomplished is a fascinating part of the book\u2014again, not unlike today except that some compromises were made so that something could get done.) But despite Hoover\u2019s shortcomings, he apparently believed in the ability of engineering to make life generally better for people and recognized that not to provide relief and reconstruction for the people in the flooded areas would drag the entire country down economically. Assumption by the federal government of responsibility for flood control along the Mississippi River and the relief provided after the flood changed public expectations of what federal government could and should do for localities and individuals.I haven\u2019t even touched on race relations (which is the greatest of euphemisms), the growth of the KKK, the unimaginable squalor that people in the Delta lived in under the plantation system, the many interesting and dominant personalities (LeRoy Percy in particular), and the bits that made me want to learn more about presidents Wilson and Coolidge.* The one fact that most people know about Wilson is his support for the League of Nations; yet he was a southerner who fostered resegregation of federal government, which had been desegregated. Coolidge, a compromise candidate drafted as the nominee for his first term, evidently sat on the porch and did absolutely nothing for eight years. Clearly I was not paying enough attention in U.S. History class my junior year. All this, and (except for some parts about how the river flows, which I glossed over somewhat) enjoyable reading. This book is eminently worthy of its subtitle: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America. *If anyone knows of a book with capsule biographies of the American presidents, along the lines of The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England by Antonia Fraser, I\u2019d love to read it.

The levees that were supposed to protect the surrounding area failed as water poured into cities like Greenville, Mississippi. Over 27,000 square miles were flooded. By May of 1927, parts of the river were 60 miles wide. A levee was deliberately dynamited to prevent the flooding of New Orleans which caused the flooding of most of St. Bernard Parish. Even though the people in the flooded areas were promised to be paid for their losses, most never were paid more than a few dollars.This should be an interesting book. The 1927 Mississippi flood was the largest and most destructive flood on the river and it is barely known. But there is something missing from this book. I found it hard to get interested in it and found myself skimming through pages. There are details about how the levees became the main way to prevent flooding but even though the author discusses other options he doesn't explain them clearly or provide diagrams showing how they would work. There is only one map but it provides a view of the entire river system and leaves out many of the places he talks about in the book. He provides a lot of biography on particular people who aren't really that interesting. He concentrates almost totally on Mississippi (especially Greenville) and the parishes around New Orleans even though Arkansas had the worst flooding with almost 14% of the state underwater. (I had to go to Wikipedia to find that out.) For what he provides, 400 pages shouldn't be too long but the book really just seemed to drag along. And even though the river flooding had a dramatic effect on the people of the area and the future of politics in the south, he only provides about 10 pages on the post-flooding south.Overall I found this book hard to get through. It seemed he really want to write a book about the Percy family but realized that kind of book wouldn't sell.
