All these adjectives describe Shine Not Burn by Elle Casey. I love books that are able to simply take you away and make you laugh and feel. Sometimes you need a book that will be light and fun without any extreme drama or angst. After all, reading is about fun. It is nice to get back to that with books such as this one.Gavin \u201cMack\u201d Mackenzie:\nI doubted at this point that I'd be able to string a coherent sentence together. His beauty combined with his slow-talking cowboy sexiness had completely robbed me of any intelligence.*Sweet Jesus, he's hung. That\u2019s some kind of magic. The way he somehow fits that thing into those pants.\nAndrea \u201cAndie\u201d Marks:\nLife plan, the document that laid out the route that would lead me to my goals: independence, safety, and financial success.\nAndie did not really know stability growing up with a mother who found her security is one asshole to the next. At the age of fifteen she was determined to change her circumstances and developed a life plan. Who knew that one weekend away in Las Vegas could derail her carefully laid plans. One short weekend....\nI really liked this cowboy. Mack. But I didn\u2019t know a single thing about him other than the fact he doesn\u2019t wear underwear and he\u2019s got a big cock-a-doodle doo that he definitely knows how to use. Yee haw.\nAndie has been coerced into a weekend in Las Vegas with her two best friends. Her best friend, Kelly, is getting married and every girl needs a bachelorette party. Right? Andie\u2019s boyfriend, who frankly is an ass of epic proportions, soon becomes an ex as he does not agree with the Las Vegas plans. Therefore, for once in her life Andie is determined to have a weekend of fun. One weekend to let loose and then she would go back to diligently following her life plan. Lady luck is shining down on Andie when she meets a sexy cowboy after spilling her drink on him. The two play some blackjack and let loose. And by loose, I mean get down and dirty. Yup. Mack is in Vegas to celebrate his brother\u2019s impending nuptials. He never expected to meet a sexy woman who is smart and sassy. Andie and Mack spend the night sharing and sexing it up. Both are surprised at how they feel this is more than sex. The problem is that Andie and Mack were both drunk. In the morning they go their separate ways with a whole lot of confusion in the mix. The repercussions of the weekend only come to the forefront two years later.After her weekend in Las Vegas, Andie comes back with a renewed determination to follow her life plan. For the last two years things have been on track. She has made junior partner at her law firm and she is engaged to get married to Bradley. Even though her life plan is in order, Andie has lost her two best friends and is leading a pretty empty life. She just does not see it. She is blind to the fact that her fianc\u00e9 is a douche and has alienated her from everyone she cares about. With one week until the wedding Andie discovers that she is married to a Gavin Mackenzie when her request for a marriage license is denied. As Andie quickly comes to grips with the shocking information, bits and pieces of her one weekend in Las Vegas start to come to light. Andie has a plan though. She is going to find Gavin Mackenzie and get the marriage annulled. How hard can that be?\n\u201cI can\u2019t let you go because you are mine.\u201d*\"You're my wife,\" he said, only inches away, his hot breath flickering over my lips. \"You married me in Las Vegas two years ago.\" \"Yes.\"\"And I'm your husband.\"I nodded, tears slipping out.He gritted his teeth and growled out, \"And this is us, consummating our marriage.\"*\"With every thrust, he gave me his response, \"You. Are. My. Wife.\" The last word came out as a growl.\"\nWhen Andie comes face to face with Mack again all the emotions, attraction, chemistry and lust that she experienced in Law Vegas comes rushing back. Andie came to see Mack unwavering in her determination to get the marriage annulled and to find out what exactly happened in Las Vegas but the longer she spends with Mack and his family the more she questions her fianc\u00e9, her job and her life plan. She has a hard time seeing Mack fitting into that life plan of hers and because of this she fights her feelings. I admit that there were numerous times where I wanted to punch Andie the face to get her to wake up. Mack was absolute perfection and the fact that she did not see this made me want to shove her life plan up her ass. As resolute as Andie was in her mind-set to end things, Mack was equally as strong-willed when it came to winning her over. To him, what he experienced in Law Vegas was real and true and now that Andie was back in his life a second time he was not going to let her go. Let\u2019s just say that I adored Mack. Utter. Swoon-worthy. Male. With some dips and twists along the way and the help of Mack\u2019s family, Andie and Mack discover that what happened in Vegas was life altering and beautiful.All in all, Shine Not Burn was a swoony romantic story that had my heart fluttering. Oh, if we were to all have a Mack of our own this world would be a mighty fine place. Indeed. If you are in the mood for an uncomplicated, well-written, sweet romance, I would tell you to give this one a go. So...give it a go!\nSometimes, we just have to go where the wind takes us and see where we end up."}, {"userName": "Jessica's Totally Over The Top Book Obsession", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28967089-jessica-s-totally-over-the-top-book-obsession", "userReview": "5 Cowboy up Stars*Some Spoilers*\n\u201cIf you really, really want me to stop touching you, I will.

This is my first time reading a Elle Casey book, and I am now a total fan girl. This is such a funny, sexy, and sweet love story I was swooning all over the place.

Marriage, making partner at her law firm, and have children by the time she is 35 years old. She has followed her lifeplan since she was 15 years old except for those 2 days in Vegas for her best friend's bachelorette party. All she remembers about that Vegas trip 2 years ago was getting super drunk and that she slept with a sexy cowboy and the next day he left without a word. Now Andie is engaged to get married to Bradley who fits into her life plan, even though she doesn't really like him and he doesn't treat her well. It's just one week from the wedding and Andie is shocked when the court house says she is already married and can't get a marriage license. Now Andie is off to Oregon to try get a divorce before her fiance finds out. Sweet Jesus, he's hung. That\u2019s some kind of magic. The way he somehow fits that thing into those pants. Mack:\nI'm so in love with Mack. What is not to love? A sweet, sexy Cowboy with a rockin body and huge mini Mack!!! He was perfect.

She was sweet, very serious, and clumsy as hell. She had some sass to her too. She was abused by her mom's boyfriend so she is trying hard to make a better life for herself. So much so that she has total tunnel vision when it comes to her life-plan. Andie made me laugh so hard because she was so awkward and klutzy, but she felt real to me and I was invested in her.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d I asked \u201cCity slicker. What are you looking at?\" \u201cA stupid wookie man-bear-pig who doesn\u2019t know how to mind his own business.\u201d With him, I knew I could be myself. I could be confident and sexy and in control. I could dream of a life that didn\u2019t involve a plan that had to be followed for the next ten years. I could forget where I came from and who I\u2019d left behind to become the woman I was now\"We're going to have sex again, aren't we?\" \"He gave me a wicked smile. \"Hell yes, we are.\"\n\u201cOnce I saw you, I had no choice. I was done for good. You\u2019re the last woman I ever want to be with.\u201dMack and Andie have sizzling chemistry, and the sex in this book WOW talk about HOT! DAYUM!!!!! In this book there is two things that normally ruin books for me a love triangle (kinda) with Bradley and Mack and since Andie is married to one man and engaged to the other she was cheating on one of them \"technically\" but it didn't bother me at all. Not even a little, which is shocking to me, but it was written in a way that didn't upset me in the least. I love Mack's family they're all awesome. The story grabbed me and I couldn't put the book down. I loved everything about this book, but the Star of the book is Mack for me. Mack alone makes me want to give this book 6 stars. I can't wait to read Ian's story. Below I leave my favorite moment from this book:\u201cI, Gavin MacKenzie, sexy cowboy man of Baker City, Oregon being of sound mind and hot body do hereby declare that I love you, Andie Marks, lawyer extraordinaire, and want to be married to you until I\u2019m so old, I either die or my pecker falls off. I will have sex with you whenever you want, and I will always give you the option to be on top if that\u2019s what will make you happy. Blowjobs will always be optional but appreciated. I will change diapers when called for, both for our children and for you when you\u2019re old and decrepit. I will never spit in public or burp too loudly or say mean things about your friends. I promise never to raise my hand against you in anger or tell you that you\u2019re useless or threaten to hurt people who you love. Ten-four, over and out, happily ever after.

I loved this book and I fell in love with a cowboy! If you're looking for a book that'll make you happy, this is it! 4.5 stars!    \"Why can't you just let me go?\" \u2026\"I can't let you go because you're mine.\"   All it took was the blurb for me to know that I wanted to read this book and from the first few pages I was hooked! It was a total escape from reality. The character made me fall in love, the romance made me swoon, and the witty writing kept me laughing and chuckling the whole way through. It was the perfect light-hearted, romantic read :)The story follows Andie who has a life plan that is spelled out to the 't'. Said life plan is comprised of a husband, 2.5 kids, a solid career and a stable, predictable future. That being said, when she's dragged off to Vegas for her best friend's bachelorette party, her perfect life plan gets derailed by a gorgeous cowboy.   \"I doubted at this point that I'd be able to string a coherent sentence together. His beauty combined with his slow-talking cowboy sexiness had completely robbed me of any intelligence.\"   Andie and Mack meet (none too gracefully I might add) when she unceremoniously (but accidentally) dumps her drink all over him at the black jack table. However, they hit it off - big time - connecting on all kinds of levels with crazy, undeniable chemistry.   My eyes widened... Sweet Jesus, he's hung. That's some kind of magic, the way he somehow fits that thing into those pants.\" ... \"No underwear,\" I said, still staring... I couldn't think of anything else to say, save, 'My god, you have a huge cock'... but that didn't seem like the smoothest of moves, so I stuck with the basics.   A whirlwind and a half later after one hell of an incredible night, she wakes up in bed... alone. They had really connected on a deep level and honestly were just perfect for each other and yet, here she was waking up in bed alone with barely coherent memories and no way to contact him. So... life went on...Two year later her cowboy was sadly forgotten and Andie was well on her way to realizing her life plan. Her job was going well and she all set to marry her fianc\u00e9 who, despite being a douchebag, fit perfectly into her 'plan'. Everything was going swimmingly until she went to apply for a marriage license only to discover that she was already married...   \"Says here in my system you married a man by the name of ... Gavin MacKenzie, on April tenth, two thousand and eleven... That name ring any bells? Gavin MacKenzie? What's that? Scottish?... Ma'am? Are you still there?\"   Much to Andie's dismay (and my squee-worthy glee), she headed off to Oregon to traipse through the countryside tracking down her cowboy \"husband\" with all intentions of divorcing the poor dude.   What are the chances that I've stepped right off the plane into a pile of horse shit?My first goal was to work up enough nerve to ask some of the most ridiculous questions I'd ever asked in my life. Here's how I pictured that conversation going:Me: Do you know Gavin MacKenzie?Country person: Who's askin'?Me: His wife.Country person: - vacant look - crickets -   Buuuuut, let's just say that his memories of their night together weren't quite as fuzzy as hers and he was not willing to let her go. Not this time! :D   \"With every thrust, he gave me his response, \"You. Are. My. Wife.\" The last word came out as a growl.\"   I loved Mack! Seriously, what a HOT cowboy. Hot and totally sweet! He was clearly just smitten with her and seeing how crazy he was for her made him all the more swoony. In Andie's words he was...   \"Sexy. Handsome. Smart. Sexy. Magnetizing. Compelling. Muscles. Good family. Confident. Polite. Sexy.\"   I loved that he wasn't willing to let her go and just *knew* that they were perfect for each other. I also loved how in his stubborn cowboy way, he was willing to fight to get her to give them a chance right from the very beginning.   \"I don't believe in divorce.\"\"I really need you to sign those papers.\"\"No.\" ...\"You don't love me, Mack.\"\"How do you know who I love and who I don't love?\"\"It's not a second chance, Mack. It can't be.\"He sat up next to me and pulled me to his side with his arm across my shoulders.Touching his head to mine he spoke in a low voice.\"Yes, it can. We're still married. Why can't we just take a shot at making it work like a real marriage?\" \u2026\"We're going to have sex again, aren't we?\"\"He gave me a wicked smile. \"Hell yes, we are.\"And then he lowered me to the ground.\"   I honestly just loved this book. It was quick, easy to read and just a delightful blend of everything happy. Really, it was exactly what I needed at the moment. My cheeks ached from grinning and I definitely squeed out loud a time or two.  Shine Not Burn  was a witty, light-hearted, addictive romance that kept me chuckling, swooning and fanning myself from start to finish! It was escapism at it's best. Andie and Mac's story is going to keep me smiling for a long time... all I'll need to think about is black jack and calf testicles but I'll let you read the book yourself to find out about those ;)4.5 stars!Casting (see above and below)  IT HAPPENED IN VEGAS. I can't be held responsible. Things that happen there are supposed to stay there, right? Right? Yeeeah. Not so much. Andie's just days away from tying the knot, but there's just ooooone little glitch. Apparently, she's already married. Or someone with her name is married to a guy out in Oregon of all places, and the courthouse won't issue her a marriage license until it's all cleared up. Tripping her way through cow pies and country songs to meet up with a man who gets around places on horseback is her very last idea of how to have a good time, but if she's going to get married, make partner at the firm, and have two point five kids before she's thirty-five, she needs to get to the bottom of this snafu and fix it quick ... before her fiance finds out and everything she's been working toward goes up in flames.

Andie doesn't really want to go because she knows her friends will go wild because \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\"\"They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but sometimes the trouble follows you home. Know what I mean?\"She gets completely drunk and meets up with a drop dead gorgeous cowboy named Mack over a table playing BlackJack. They have some wild monkey sex and the next morning she heads back to her normal life. Fast forward two years, Andie's life plan is on track. She is about to marry \"That Bradley\" who is a jerk and has alienated her from her friends but he fits into her plan so very well that whoohoo it's on. Then she finds out that something happened in Vegas that she didn't remember. Her and that Cowboy-they got married that night.So she shows up at his Oregon ranch asking for a divorce.\nI really liked this cowboy. Mack. But I didn't know a single thing about him other than the fact that he doesn't wear underwear and he's got a big cock-a-doodle-doo that he definitely knows how to use. Yee-Haw.Mack doesn't want a divorce though.\nSo it comes down to a showdown at the family's annual picnic. \"That Bradley\" shows up..\nYou get a chick fight..\nAndie has started to question her whole \"life plan\" idea. Maybe living by Mack's family crest wouldn't be such a bad thing after all. \"Shine not Burn\"\nThis book is obviously very closely related to the movie \"Sweet Home Alabama\" but I loved that movie so I'm still a happy girl with it. It's funny as hell in spots and the lurrve triangle between Bradley and Mack didn't even get on my nerves. The sex was smoking hot without the use of the damn names for body parts that turn me off most contemporary romance books. This was perfection. At least to me.Now I will say, I had this author on my don't read list because of a blog post that offended me. I'm not a bully but I have been called one several times before over books, it gets to me sometimes and I just avoid any chances of confrontation. Sometimes I just get tired of all the drama though and try to overlook it. That's why I read this book. The breach between authors and readers need to be closed and I'm very glad I did. It's really a book that I loved every second of and I'll read more books by Elle Casey. I may even one star one if I end up not liking it. Does that make me a bully? Nope.

This is my very first book by Ms. Casey and I am in love. This book was perfection. I need many, many more stars than five to rate this book. It was perfect, sexy, hilarious, did I say sexy? There are plenty of more adjectives I could come up with to describe it\u2019s perfection but let me just tell you about it instead.Andie Marks\u2019s life didn\u2019t start out very well. With a childhood full of abandonment and abuse, she made a plan, a life plan, to get herself out of the situation she was in. She followed this plan to the letter and it has worked for her so far. Until she went to Las Vegas that is. Andie\u2019s best friend is getting married so the three of them went off to Las Vegas to celebrate their last time as single best friends. After quite a few cocktails, Andie met the hottest cowboy she has ever seen. Whether it was him or all the cocktails helping, Andie found herself rid of all her inhibitions that usually hold her down, and letting loose.Flash forward two years, Andie is working 60 hour weeks at her law firm and is about to get married to a fellow lawyer. He is her perfect match in her lifeplan. The problem is, that the courthouse says she is already married, to a cowboy in Baker City, Oregon! So off Andie goes to a world of horses, cows, rattlesnakes and God knows what else, to get the cowboy to sign on the dotted line so she can get back to her lifeplan.\n\u201cThis family was like a drug I could easily get addicted to.\u201d\u201cSomething about this place was messing with my head and making me forget what was important including the future I\u2019d planned for myself.\u201d\nWhat Andie finds in Baker City is definitely not what she thought. Again, she is faced with the most handsome man she has ever seen. But it\u2019s more than that. He has a home here with people that love him, that she could easily love. She feels like she can breathe for the first time in a very long time. And there is the cowboy, the sexy blue eyed man she just can\u2019t seem to keep her hands off. But she has to go back. Her life is not here. Her lifeplan has to be kept in tact. Doesn\u2019t it?\n\u201cThe wind had blown me to Baker City, Oregon and by being here I\u2019d found a place in the world where I could very possibly discover peace, for the first time in my life.\u201d\n\nOk, my review might sound a little serious but really, this book is hilarious. Andie did have a lot to work through, but the way she did it had me rolling on the floor laughing. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything so you just have to trust me on this. But when she and Mack are together, well, spontaneous combustion happens! I was looking for a sexy cowboy book and my wonderful friend recommended this to me and I couldn\u2019t be more thankful. I loved it. I more than loved it! Mack will fulfill any sexy cowboy fantasies you might have, rest assured. So will I go on and read book two in this series, MacKenzie Fire which is Ian, Mack\u2019s brother\u2019s story?

I've been missing out on my sweet reads lately so when this book was recommended to me, I had the feeling that 'shine not burn' was going to be just what I needed to fall in love, sit back and enjoy and yes, it delivered on all counts for me, sweet, easy and sexy.What's it all about?Andrea 'Andie' Marks has an organised life to the extreme, her life plan is firmly in place leaving no room for error or distraction. Andie has worked all her adult life seeking order and in turn landing herself in some dubious relationships. A trip with the girls to Las Vegas throws Gavin 'Mack' Mackenzie into her life and here's where things get messy ... Alcohol, lust and an extremely tempting cowboy leads to a very Las Vegas style problem, a problem that comes back to bite Andie on the bottom when she is set to marry her very 'life plan list friendly' boyfriend. A trip to the country follows to rectify the mistake and Andie is forced to look at her life, her heart and what she really wants.Meet the characters ...Andrea Marks, oh dear what mistakes this intelligent, career driven 'twenty-something' makes. Her flighty mother and car wreck relationships have taught Andie a few bad life lessons about the type of man she wants to pursue, so Andie ends up picking the worst candidates for boyfriends and leading herself down some very unhappy paths. I couldn't figure out whether to be annoyed at this character or empathise. Andie is a smart, intelligent, resourceful woman trouble is she repeatedly fails on the friendship and relationship front, but I found myself warming to her failures, and actually cheering for the life plan to be thrown out the window and for this controlled city chick to find love in the country.Gavin 'Mack' Mackenzie is a dreamy hero complete with sexy one liners and a cowboy hat. His mysterious strong silent type ways were a big hit for me. I've not read a romance with a cowboy as the hero before but something tells me this won't be the last. Mack is a family player his love for his country ranch and life is heart warming. You won't find a sweeter male character anywhere but don't be fooled this hero knows what he wants. I fell right for his charms and I have definitely now got a bit of a crush on the cowboy theme. What I loved ...I have already mentioned I was hooked on the country cowboy theme I was completely sold by the storyline and sweet nature of this book. I also found myself laughing and cringing along with the characters exploits, the conversations and situations Andie had with her friends and Mack went from sweet to funny to outright cringe worthy and I loved every minute. The author really did bring the perfect blend of sexy, sweet and funny with a little bit of annoying served on the side to keep things interesting. The characters and quick pace of the book kept me well entertained and I couldn't help but fall for the enjoyable nature of 'Shine not burn'.Final thoughts ...A sweet book that doesn't require to much thought or brain power. If you like cowboys and romance and you don't mind battling it out with an ever so slightly annoying heroine then you have nothing to loose ... Jump right in, enjoy.SORRY ... Did I hear you say you needed a little extra cowboy visual? ...

Andie is surprised with how much she and Mack hit it off. She doesn\u2019t know everything about him, but she loves what she knows. \nI really liked this cowboy. Mack. But I didn\u2019t know a single thing about him other than the fact he doesn\u2019t wear underwear and he\u2019s got a big cock-a-doodle doo that he definitely knows how to use. Yee haw.\n\nWhen Andie wakes up the next morning, she doesn\u2019t remember much. She has the worst hangover ever. Her phone gets dropped in the toilet, and Mack has already left the hotel room.Fast forward 2 years later...Andie is on track with her lifeplan, getting ready to marry the company douchebag, Bradley. She has alienated her friends. The only thing she cares about is that her plan is on track. Bradley has the same goals as she does. There is one BIG PROBLEM when she goes to pick up the marriage license... she finds that she is already married. To a Gavin Mackenzie. Apparently two years ago, she got hitched in Vegas to Mack. She has to find him, get the marriage annulled before anyone finds out. Andie goes crosscountry to Mack\u2019s ranch. Oh Mack... sweet baby Jesus I love that cowboy! Andie describes him best- Sexy. Handsome. Smart. Sexy. Magnetizing. Compelling. Muscles. Good family. Confident. Polite. Sexy.\u2028Andie meets Mack\u2019s family, and she feels that same spark she felt with him years ago. She needs to find out what happened between them, to get him to sign the papers and be on her way. He is not about to make that easy on her... \nI can\u2019t let you go because you\u2019re mine. And because I can\u2019t stand to see you sad. I\u2019m going to fix that.\n\nAfter spending a few days with Mack and his family, Andie has to make some tough desicions, re-evaluate her entire life and \u2018lifeplan\u2019. She\u2019s not sure she can give this cowboy up a second time around, but it would never work. It\u2019s not part of her plan. But sometimes, you have to let go of your plans to find something much better than you\u2019ve ever imagined...\nSometimes, we just have to go where the wind takes us and see where we end up.\n\nWow! This book sort of came out of nowhere for me- but I loved it! Such a fun read. All kinds of sweet, sexy, and hilarious! I LOL\u2019d several times, swooned over Mack the entire time... this is the first book I\u2019ve read by this author, but it won\u2019t be the last!

He was truly sigh worthy and so very SEXY! I LOVED everything about him, especially the way he would look into Andie\u2019s eyes, the way he treated Andie with such care, his honesty, his loyalty and the way he did not give up no matter what added so much to his appeal.I liked Andie too. She is the one that added most of the humor into this read. Some of the things she said and done were priceless. I have to admit, I wanted to hit her upsides her head a time or two. She kept fighting her true feelings about Mack and that drove me crazy.There were also some fantastic secondary characters to round off this amazing read. The heat level was really good, the sex scenes sexy, hot and sensual. Mack sure knew how to pleasure a woman, just another thing I loved about him and this book.In the end, I was treated to a wonderful epilogue leaving me completely happy with the way things finally turned out.I\u2019m looking forwards to reading Mack\u2019s brother Ian\u2019s and Andie\u2019s best friend Candice\u2019s story, MacKenzie Fire in the very near future.If you\u2019re looking for a wonderful story with loads of humor, just the right amount of heat, that will make you laugh, sigh and smile, then I say give it a try."}, {"userName": "Pearl Angeli", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31514572-pearl-angeli", "userReview": "\"They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but sometimes the trouble follows you home.\"\n\n3.5 StarsWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but that's not the case for Andie Marks because just when she was about to get married to her fianc\u00e9, she was notified that she's not allowed to wed someone because she's already married to the sexy cowboy named Mack whom she met and had a one-night-stand with two years ago in Las Vegas.Ooops. I really loved the premise of this book. It also started funny which absolutely sold me. To add icing to the cake, Mack is one hot specimen. A rare specimen.If only the heroine, Andie, was not annoying, I would have enjoyed it even more and might have given the book 4 stars. But the woman was so self-centered, whiny, and a bit of a brat which really irked me most of the time. Good thing Mack was so perfect and there were lots of funny and hot scenes and oh, the settings-- Las Vegas and Baker City, Oregon were also beautifully described.It's my first time to read an Elle Casey book and I really loved her witty writing and her great sense of humor. Plus, she gave the side characters complex traits and personalities. Favorite part of the book:The vows.

If you want to go horseback riding and then do some more riding with/the cowboy...look no further!This is your book! Period.No seriously. Shine Not Burn is an escapism buscuit. It's fun, light, at times thoughtful and really sweet. It's a standalone contemporary romance, but also the first book in a two book series that will expand on Andie's friend and Mack\u2019s brother.Let's talk story...\n\n\u201cI really liked this cowboy.

He is handsome, strong and just all around perfect with the whole cowboy thing he has going on. Problem is, the first time she lays eyes on him she is already half drunk, attending her best friend\u2019s bachelorette party in Las Vegas and on top of that he does not, I repeat - DOES NOT- fit into her life plan. Not at all.Regardless, they play blackjack, hook up and she pretty much doesn't remember anything after that...You know, typical weekend in Vegas!Cut to two years later. Andie is set to be married to one of her lawyer co-worker, the one who fits her life plan. There is just one minor thing to take care of. Figure out why the state of Nevada is under the impression that she is already married.Must be a mistake, right?\n\n\u201cThey say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but sometimes the trouble follows you home. Know what I mean?\u201d\n\nMore hilariousness ensues.Being inside Andie's head was highly entertaining, she is a three dimensional character with a past that very much influences her present and her struggle to start living the life she actually wants is very well done.Mack is amazing. He is a stoic kind of guy. Talks little, but his actions speak volumes. He is very determined and when he wants something he sure knows how to get it.\n\n\u201cLove is what it is, and love does what it does to survive. It\u2019s an instinct.\u201d\n\nShine Not Burn is the love child of The Hangover and Sweet Home Alabama. Absolutely hilarious and heartwarming and my face was seriously hurting from laughing so much. The only things I have to point out are the second hand embarrassment and the rushed ending. Quirky heroines usually have the problem of foot in mouth syndrome and this one is no exception. I do cringe occasionally when that happens and I just wanted to point it out.The second thing, a rushed ending. It\u2019s just a personal thing. By the time we got to the finish line I was so invested in the characters and I just wish there was a little more. That\u2019s all. But I\u2019m already reading the second book and Mack and Andie play a very prominent role in that one as well, so all is good in the end. ;)All in all, a very enjoyable read, a good laugh and a sweet story.

Turns out she may have brought a souvenier home with her from that Vegas trip . . . . \nAndie needs to get this problem resolved ASAP and on the downlow before her fianc\u00e9 finds out. All it will take is a couple of signatures \u2013 that is, if she can fight off her attraction to the sexy cowboy . . . .\nShelby's review is the only reason I got this book. Authors, please take note that bad titles and even worse covers will not expand your reader base. Sweet Home Alabama is one of my guilty pleasures and I get sucked in to watching it every time it\u2019s on so the .gifs used in Shelby\u2019s review made it impossible for me to resist requesting Shine Not Burn. My apologies to all of you who were crossing your fingers for a catfight due to her steering me wrong, but there won't be one. While a 3 Star rating may look low, it\u2019s actually really high when it comes to how I generally rate romance novels. It seems everyone likes a ragey review. Sorry I can\u2019t give you a full-on freakout this time, but here are some items that kept this from earning more than 3 Stars from me. 1. The length. There should be a maximum number of pages allowed for a romance novel. 360? Too long. This story could have easily been wrapped up with 50-100 fewer pages.2. The tired trope. Not only do we have the \u201coh, I don\u2019t remember what happened last night\u201d storyline to navigate, but there has also been a lot of clumsy female MCs lately. I don\u2019t mind the \u201cspilled drink on the crotch of the potential love interest\u201d meet-cute (even though it\u2019s been done a thousand times before), but having this supposed rainmaker of an attorney be a bumbling idiot got old fast.3. Things that make me dry-heave. Lines like this:\n\u201cI reveled in the smell of our passion on his mouth.\u201d\nMake me do things like this . . . \nAlso????\n\u201cMy folds so heavy with passion they were blocking his entry.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone find talk like that to be a turn-on? (Don\u2019t answer that. I really don\u2019t want to know.)4. The sometimes/sometimes not use of condoms. My own personal preference is for the MCs to always practice safe sex, but I\u2019m a 1,000 year old prude who has been married for 147 years so I get that it\u2019s not always going to be written that way. What I don\u2019t understand is the use of a condom, then not, then yes, then no. WTF? Either use them or don\u2019t.Those complaints aside, Shine Not Burn was a fluffy little way to spend my Saturday afternoon that made me feel like I should probably add some boots to my wardrobe in case I murder my husband ever run into a desperate cowboy . . . \nAnd finally, I\u2019m always a sucker for a HEA . . . .\n(Even when said HEA doesn\u2019t really address the issues that will probably cause the newlyweds to get divorced in less than a year.)ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

The question is, could I have a one-night stand with a man named Mack who wears a cowboy hat to a casino?When the book opens we meet Andie a hard working and very determined lawyer who is about to go away to Vegas for girlfriends bachelorette party. You soon find out that this not a trip Andie wants to take but her friends will not take no for an answer; therefore she is going. \n\u201cOh my god. I had crazy monkey sex with a cowboy.\u201d\nWhat starts out as a fun night with the girls for Andie quickly turns in to H O T CRAZY MONKEY S-E-X with a cowboy named Mack. And it all started with a game of blackjack.I\u2019ve never read a female character who was a bigger klutz then Andie. Her embarrassing moments had me putting my head down in shame for her. In a way it helps bring her character to life even more because I could feel her embarrassment. The way her and Mack meet\u2026 PRICELESS. She trips while walking in sky high heels and her drink lands on none other than Mack. He is literally dripping from hat to crotch.. But WAIT, that\u2019s not the kicker..Then\u2026then she proceeds to wipe him down.\n\u201cI think you\u2019d better stop now.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d\n  I was totally confused. He looked down at his crotch, still holding onto my wrist. I followed his gaze and nearly had another heart attack. There was a distinct bulge going down the leg of his pants that hadn\u2019t been there before.BAHAHAHAHAHA!!! I love it!I definitely felt the sparks between Andie and Mack and the sex.. Lord have mercy the sex scenes will cause you to wiggle in your seat. Fair warning, do not read this in public.One night in Vegas and some really really good HOT MONKEY SEX is all it takes to derail Andie\u2019s future plans without her even knowing it.Who is Andie?Andrea Marks better known as Andie Andie has a life plan with set goals that she hopes to obtain at different points in her life.\n\u201cI know what\u2019s important. I\u2019ve had a carefully crafted lifeplan guiding my actions since I was fifteen: go to college, go to law school, make partner, get married, have children. It\u2019s absolutely normal and fine. All those things are important and valuable to any sane person. It makes complete sense on paper.\u201d\nYeah, she is definitely off her rocker with this life plan crap. Her goals consist of moving up in her firm, getting married having kids the whole shah-bang. Life on the other hand has its own plans and they DO NOT line up with Andie\u2019s.When she is just about to reach one of her goals by marrying Bradley, her boyfriend of two years, she hits a road block. One that has her traveling across the country to a small town in Oregon looking for a cowboy named Mack; armed with divorce papers and in need of his signature.Who is Mack?Gavin Mackenzie better known as MackMack had me wrapped up in his lasso the second he sat down with Andie at the blackjack table. He is reserved, far from arrogant, very charming and hung like a horse (Andie\u2019s words not mind tough I enjoy repeating it) *Grins* He glanced at me, smiling devilishly. \u201cI like a little mystery to my women. I think the song lyric says it best: Lady on the street but a freak in the bed.\u201dMack does not make this easy for Andie\u2026At all.\n\u201cCome on, wife. Come take a little ride with me. Let me show you all the things you'll be missing when you go back East and leave me here with a broken heart.\u201d\n*Le sigh* \nMy Thoughts\n If you are looking for a sexy light read, that will have you laughing out loud with its witty banter and klutzy heroine this book is for you.This is not a deep character driven book so if that is what you want move on.The writing style reminded me of the ones you mostly see in Harlequin romance novels.

I need to see why she loves this author so much! (We both realized our tastes have changed and that it wasn't a purchase she'd still make for me today)Okay, so, I didn't love this. And, come on, let's give me a little credit: I may hand out a lot of 4 and 5 stars, but those books aren't ever given a 5 based solely on the boys I so fondly adore. No, they have to earn it by merit, and yes, sometimes I may bump up the rating a little because I just wanted a happy read and something made me happy-that's just how I work. But when there is something so ghastly as what bothered me in this book, then I just can't do the 'oh-my-gosh-this-was-perfect-but..' rating bump. Because, as much as it pains me to say this, there was one thing and one thing only I hated about this book, and it was enough to lower my rating by TWO WHOLE STARS:THE MAIN CHARACTER, ANDIE.\nNever in all of my life, well, maybe once or twice, have I hated a main character in such a fun-loving romantic comedy book as much as this chick. She's indecisive, wishy-washy, ignorant, and completely blind. Indecisive. Back and forth. Did I say indecisive? Pulls on heartstrings. Waitwaitwait, there's more.....SHE'S THE LITERAL DEFINITION OF A MOTHER-FUCKING DOORMAT. For real-People dissed on Tate from Ugly Love?? Andie could take lessons from Tate, she's \nthat\n dumb, PS-I adored Tate in Ugly Love, she just seems to be the first person I can think of that people would know. I mean, what person cares so little about their life and their happiness...all so they can follow a GD life plan?? Wtf. How moronic. Don't hate me, Jen, please, because I have a super redeeming sentence for this review that will make you think way more of me:Mack was the most amazing, selfless, sexy-as-sin male lead I've read about in a long time, and he is the only reason I literally cannot rate this book lower than a 3. It's impossible, sorry not sorry. I only said I can't give this five stars for a guy, I didn't say I wouldn't keep the rating respectful for him. He is just....god he was the kindest, sweetest, most butterfly-inducing man, even if I think he fell for a dumbass bimbo way too quickly in Vegas-However, I do think it was so sincere and so sweet that it didn't bother me. And, again, the only problem with any of this story was that...ARGH-Andie chick. And if I had room ANYWHERE on my BBF shelf, he'd be up in the higher rankings. I know, I know, will wonders of Chelsea never cease to exist?? lol I can't say I don't want to keep going on and on and on about Mack....because I do. I just couldn't get enough of him. No, I didn't believe it at first, the whole in love with a dipshit thing, but as the story progressed, he broke my heart and made my stomach unbearably butterfly clogged, and he even whipped out that, dare I say it, hoarse, broken whisper voice (EEEEEPS, I KNOW! Be still my heart!!). So, he got me-he got me good. But, like I said, there was just too much that annoyed me with the MC to keep going on about and not become a broken record.

He excuses himself to the bathroom and he asks her to watch his spot at the table.

Finding out I was married to him would\u2019ve been fucking awesome. Hold up. Wait. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let me back up a sec\u2026.So I read a couple reviews prior to picking this up, seeing whether or not I really wanted to give it shot. Turns out, the cowboy Hero involved is a real sweetheart, so I couldn\u2019t pass it up. Plus, I haven\u2019t read one featuring a cowboy in a while, so I was intrigued and decided to give it a go. Turns out this is my second book in a row that featured a night in Vegas ending up in a surprise marriage. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not complaining; it became a very good read. \n\u201cJust because a person is obsessed with the idea of something, it doesn\u2019t make it right or even good for them.\u201d\nAndie has plan: Make partner, get married and have the two point five kids by the time she\u2019s thirty-five. She is determined to see it all the way through, even though her track record with men isn\u2019t anything to brag about, but I\u2019ll get to that in a bit. The only time she has ever veered slightly off the plan was when she went to Vegas for her friend\u2019s bachelorette party and met a sexy cowboy. She was instant lust when she first laid eyes on Mack. After she accidently spilled her drink on him, the ice was broken, and they instantly hit it off. \nWith him, I knew I could be myself. I could be confident and sexy and in control. I could dream of a life that didn\u2019t involve a plan that had to be followed for the next ten years. I could forget where I came from and who I\u2019d left behind to become the woman I was now. \nThe men Andie\u2019s life so far have fit certain criteria, which so far has resulted in dating a couple douches. There was something about Mack that was completely different and completely freeing. It could\u2019ve been the alcohol, but then again it could be something else entirely. Her and Mack spent a passionate night in Vegas, ending with a hint of something big. \nLuceo non uro means I shine, not burn. To me, though, it means that I have a choice. I need to balance the bad with the good, make sure to avoid the things that could burn or scar me but get close enough to the heat that I feel life and really experience it. Until I met you, I\u2019d never really embraced that idea.\nHowever, when Andie wakes up the next morning, she really couldn\u2019t pinpoint what happened the night prior. What happened to her sexy cowboy? Though she wouldn\u2019t admit it, she did feel slightly heartbroken at the thought of never seeing him again. Fast forward two years later\u2026Andie is getting ready to marry the biggest douche imaginable. She\u2019s so focused on her plan, that she can\u2019t see what her friends around her see. She\u2019s completely shut out everyone around her. When she applies for her marriage license, she finds out she\u2019s married. When she finds out it happened in Vegas, she immediately starts to piece things to together: Her cowboy and her got married in Vegas. What a clusterfuck! She needed to fix things ASAP, otherwise her plans will go down in flames. Will he even remember her? \nAnd I felt that point he was making with every thrust. He was taking possession of me, laughing in the face of whatever plan I\u2019d made before coming here. He was calling the shots, not me. \u2026With every thrust, he gave me his response. \u201cYou. Are. My. Wife.\u201d The last word came out as a growl.\nOh man, I knew the moment Mack sees her at his ranch, things were going to get ugly. He was pissed, angry, but most of all, heartbroken. He really did fall for Andie. He is determined to keep her. Their chemistry is still potent and all he needs is time to convince her to give their relationship a try. I would\u2019ve given this more stars, but to be quite honest, I wanted to bitch slap Andie, like multiple times. There were times where I was sporting some serious brass knuckles and then going to town on her. Seriously, she pissed me off. I wanted to yell, Get your head out of your ass and look at what you have in front of you!! Gahh! I hate stubborn ass heroines. As for Mack\u2026well, he\u2019s the newest member of my ultimate book boyfriend shelf. He made the book so worth it. Plus the steam in this book could rival any erotica book. Yea, it was HOT.

I loved Elle Casey's Just One Night serial, so I knew I wanted to read this book. It took me a while to finally get to it, but I'm so happy I finally read it.Andie is a successful lawyer. Everything is in order and going according to her life plan. She didn't have the best childhood growing up. As a teen she made a plan that would get her out of that environment and into one that she controlled, was independent and felt safe in. I think we've all heard the saying, \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\" Well, this sorta happens to Andie when she and her two best friends go to Vegas to celebrate Kelly's upcoming nuptials. Andie had just been broken with by her scumbag boyfriend via text. So, when she sees a sexy cowboy in the casino of her hotel she can't help but walk up to him. Well, the several drinks she had before that might have given her the liquid courage she needed. \n\"He could call me ma'am all night if he wanted to.\"\nGetting a drink dumped on him was not what Mack was expecting as he sat playing cards in Vegas where he went to celebrate his brother getting married. But when he looked up and saw Andie standing there a little tipsy and mortified, he didn't mind so much. They played blackjack for a while allowing the sexual attraction between them to grow.\n\"I really liked this cowboy. Mack. But I didn\u2019t know a single thing about him other than the fact he doesn\u2019t wear underwear and he\u2019s got a big cock-a-doodle doo that he definitely knows how to use. Yee haw.\"\nEventually they went back to her room where they talked and had some wild crazy amazing monkey sex. The next morning she wakes up not remembering much of what happened the night before. Then, two years later, the things she couldn't remember suddenly make themselves known when she gets a call from the courthouse letting her know she needs to file her divorce decree before she can get a new marriage license. This puts a giant wrench into her plans and now she's going to have to go to Oregon to convince the cowboy to divorce her. This was very pleasing to me because her fianc\u00e9, Bradley, is such a pretentious prick and his nasty attitude has began to rub off on Andie. She never really even liked him anyway, but on paper he seems to have the same goals as Andie which led her to think they are a match, so she begins dating him and eventually gets engaged. Their relationship even caused her to withdraw from her friends.On a mission to get Mack to sign the divorce papers and return to her regular life without anyone even noticing Andie takes off. Because it's a busy time at the farm and because Mack remembered more about their night in Vegas than Andie, Mack doesn't give her much time once she arrives. Andie spends time with his family, especially his mother who is so sweet. Just talking with her has Andie rethinking things. Does she really want a divorce from Mack so that she can actually get back to her life plan or does it even matter anymore? I really enjoyed this book. I listened to the audiobook and think that Lauren Ezzo did an amazing job with the voices. There wasn't that much angst really and it was sort of predictable, but I was still swept away by the story and loved every minute of it. Sometimes you just want a sexy, feel good story and that's exactly what it was.
