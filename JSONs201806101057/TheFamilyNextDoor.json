I wondered if I could possibly enjoy this novel as much as I enjoyed her previous novel, \u201cThe Mother\u2019s Promise\u201d. Well I did, I absolutely loved this novel.\n\u201cDo you ever really know your neighbours?\u201d\nThe suburb of Pleasant Court really lives up to its name. It\u2019s a perfectly pleasant place with perfectly pleasant people. An ideal place to raise children.Essie Walker had quite a hard time adjusting to motherhood the first time around. In fact, one day almost ended in disaster. Thankfully, disaster was averted, and Essie improved. Now it is three years later, and Essie has another daughter, Polly. Things have been easier this time around and Essie is lucky to have her mother living next door, able to help out. Polly had been quite an easy baby at first. However, lately, she\u2019s been waking almost hourly and almost never naps. Essie\u2019s mother and husband are a little worried about how Essie is handling things.But now everyone is distracted by a newcomer to Pleasant Court. Isabelle Heatherington has apparently moved to Melbourne for work. But why would a single woman with no children rent a four bedroom home for just her to live in? And why is she asking so many questions about her neighbours and their children?When Essie meets Isabelle she feels an instant connection. She could use a new friend. Though she gets along with her neighbours, Fran and Ange, they aren\u2019t what you would consider friends\u2026more like friendly acquaintances.\n \u201cIf Ange was the image of the life you wanted to lead, Fran was the image of the person you want to be\u201d\nBut there\u2019s more to Fran and Ange than meets the eye\u2026.Fran constantly has the feeling that her life is a moment away from unraveling completely. Her husband, Nigel wonders why she is constantly breaking down in tears. Fran runs for miles every day until her legs and chest burn. It's almost like she\u2019s punishing herself, literally running herself into the ground.Then we have Ange and her gorgeous husband, Lucas. The perfect husband and father\u2026though she can never seem to find him when she needs him. Why won\u2019t she ask the questions that continue to plague her? Are the pictures she constantly posts on Instagram really to show everyone how great her life its? Or is she #tryingtoconvinceherselfSo many secrets!!! During this Melbourne summer heat wave, things definitely start to heat up around Pleasant Court.As I said at the beginning of my review, I LOVED this novel. Sally Hepworth has a remarkable ability to create stories with relatable characters that are completely entertaining. The story is told from multiple points of view, which can sometimes be hard to keep up with, but I honestly had no problem keeping things straight.This novel deals with many different issues, some that I wouldn't have expected, and I can clearly see that the author has done her research. It made me think about the things we will do to keep the peace. The questions we don\u2019t ask. How complicated marriage, relationships, and parenthood can be.I hated having to put the book down. I HAD to know how things were going to turn out. Everything is revealed at a perfect pace. We learn what\u2019s happening in each household, and it all comes together in what I thought was a fantastic and satisfying way.Sally Hepworth has written another thought-provoking and entertaining novel with the perfect amount of intrigue and suspense. A story of love, family, secrets, lies, forgiveness and so much more.\u201cThe Family Next Door\u201d was one of my top ten most anticipated reads for 2018 and I can honestly say that although it\u2019s still the beginning of the year, I\u2019m pretty sure that this book will be on my top ten best reads of 2018.I can\u2019t wait to see what Sally Hepworth comes up with next!Thank you to St. Martin\u2019s Press for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Susanne Strong", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne-strong", "userReview": "5 stars.How well do you know the people closest to you? Are they who you think they are? Is anyone?These are the questions at the heart of Sally Hepworth\u2019s new novel \u201cThe Family Next Door.\u201d  It is a phenomenal novel that delves into the minds of several families and specifically five complicated women. Some are mothers and daughters; others friends or neighbors. The only thing I can tell you is that nothing is as it seems. Essie and her mother Barbara, as well as Ange, Fran and Isabelle live in a community where your become friends with your neighbors - and you think you know them and you think you know them well. All I can say is that no one is ever who you think they are. Eye-opener!What Sally Hepworth does here is nothing short of brilliant. She writes about people\u2019s idiosyncrasies; their secrets, what makes them human, what makes them tick and how they operate. And in \u201cThe Family Next Door\u201d no one is left unscathed.\u201cThe Family Next Door\u201d is a must read. Like all of Sally Hepworth\u2019s other novels it is compelling and extremely well written. Ms. Hepworth lured me in from the first sentence and kept me enthralled throughout. She has a way with words my friends.

The secrets of suburbia are always deliciously scandalous\u2026. And sometimes they are downright criminal. The perfect neighborhood, perfectly manicured lawns, perfect families. It all looks so picturesque from the outside, but when new neighbor, Isabelle, moves into the neighborhood of Pleasant Court, cracks suddenly begin to appear in that perfect veneer. Elle, Fran, and Ange, are very curious about Isabelle, wondering why an older, single woman has moved into their family- oriented neighborhood. But, the three ladies all have major issues, besides drawing out their new neighbor, that are commanding their time and attention, behind closed doors, where their seemingly perfect lives are, in fact, unraveling. I have not read any of this author\u2019s other books, but this one was advertised as \u2018for fans of Liane Moriarty\u2019. I\u2019m not sure if this is SH's usual style of writing or not, but while the comparisons to other authors is a marketing ploy I despise, in this particular case, I can see some similarities, but this author takes that format and puts her own unique spin on it. There is just something about taking a nosy peek into your neighbor\u2019s private lives that is irresistible. Getting to be the proverbial \u2018fly on the wall\u2019, this novel allows us to vicariously live out our unrequited desire to get a glimpse into what our neighbors are really like, without being accused of spying on our nearby residents. But, what makes this story really work is that each of the three featured women are coping with identifiable issues we are all sympathetic to. Postpartum depression, infidelity, money issues, and the everyday challenges of parenting are real problems many marriages face. But, while these subjects are highly dramatic and always engrossing material, the author manages to somehow take these common enough domestic issues and give them a more sinister tone. I was on pins and needles as the author unveils secrets and crimes at a tantalizing pace. I was furiously turning pages, completely lost in the lives of these seemingly ordinary suburbanites. There are a few shocking twists, but at the end of the day, there is also plenty of character growth. The characters made much needed progress, and adjusted bravely to a new normal, which set each character in an entirely different frame of mind than the one they were in, when we were first introduced. I liked the strictly feminine viewpoint and the fluidity in which the author segues one POV into another, making it easy to keep up with all the characters and gain more insight into their personal feelings and struggles, in the process. I truly enjoyed this novel! I am really looking forward to reading more books by Sally Hepworth!! 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Kaceey - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13442817-kaceey---traveling-sister", "userReview": "4.5*Do you ever secretly gaze at your neighbor and think, \u201cwow, they have it all.\u201d A beautiful home, a loving marriage, happy, healthy kids and a cute designer dog.

It\u2019s a family friendly community. Ange & Lucas - Essi & Ben - and Fran & Nigel each have two kids. Barbara is a single woman who lives next door to Essi \u2014 Barbara is Essi\u2019s mother...and a hand\u2019s on grandmother. The only single women mentioned in this community (or of significant interest) is newcomer, Isabelle. She lives next door to Essi ( we assume the opposite side from her mother) The men play a small role in the novel. It\u2019s the women who are in the drivers seat. With plenty of snide remarks, prissy attitudes, trials and tribulations, judgements, jealousy, gossip, infidelity, secrets and lies......\u201dThe Family Next Door\u201d, is equal parts a serious soap opera, soap opera parody..... .......a sympathy card to the pressures of raising a family and a satire jab at suburbia and the women who can always find something to gossip and complain about. Personally, I felt this book was \u2018readable\u2019 but not inspiring. Besides the fact that I felt the plot was thin - lacking authentic depth - I felt there were too many roads that lead to nowhere. A path got carve out ... but then we didn\u2019t get to walk on it. At the start of this story Essi leaves her baby in a park and goes home \u2014 there was potential to move the story in many directions - much could have been explored .....but instead the author quickly moved us to 3 years later \u2014 and essentially moved on to learn about everyone else in the community ( yes Essi spent time in a psychiatric institution- but it was simply mentioned).... ZIPPY-DO-DA.... Essi is well with another baby in hand. I never felt Essi\u2019s forgetting her baby -leaving it in that park - ever tied in with the rest of the story. Later \u2014 Ange wanted to begin a \u201cNeighborhood Watch\u201d....and invited the ladies to her house. NOTHING about that idea got developed. One of the kids broke his wrist - it was another tidbit detail no more important than eating Froot Loops for breakfast. The big question this novel brings up is \u201chow well do we know our neighbors\u201d? Fact is ..... I think the topic is very thin. To get me/ the reader to \u2018care\u2019 one way or another I would need another story than the one we read. At times the writing was a bit too clever and smug for its own good. If I knew this book was straight black comedy I think I might have liked it better...As it was .... otherwise \u2014 it\u2019s hard to read an entire novel with most of the women so tightly-wound up to their issues. However .... I like this quote very much.... I read it a few times. And it made me sad .....because the people who suffered most in this novel were the children.  \u201cOne thing you didn\u2019t realize until you were a grandparent was that little children were a tiny glimpse of magic in a dreadfully difficult world\u201d. ...... absolutely the authors best line in this book IMO!!!3 Stars .... I actually considered giving it less to be honest.... but I feel there ARE women who will eat this type of book up \u2014 The PLUS for me in reading it \u2014\ufffd and I\u2019m not kidding is TRYING to articulate WHY I didn\u2019t feel inspired. - THAT\u2019s a reading lesson in itself too. NOT EASY TO DO!Thank you....VERY MUCH to Saint Martin\u2019s .... for the many years of being really wonderful to so many of us early readers ... always appreciated!

No one new has moved in for quite some time, especially no one single, so the neighborhood is thrown a bit when Isabelle (who lives alone but spoke of a mysterious \"partner\" to the real estate agent) moves in alone. Everyone wants to know more about her\u2014is she straight or gay, what brings her to Sandringham, why is she renting her house, and what secrets is she hiding?The thing is, despite their curiosity about Isabelle, there are other residents of Pleasant Court who have things to hide as well, despite how picture perfect their lives seem. Why is Fran out jogging for long stretches of time two, sometimes three times a day? Is she punishing herself for something? Why is Ange's husband never where he says he is, even though he always seems so willing to help her with the kids or household chores? Why is his phone ringing all the time? And should people be worried that Essie, who several years ago left her baby daughter alone at the park, might be suffering from postpartum depression again after the birth of her second child?As each individual struggles to navigate the chaos of their own lives, they still want to know more about Isabelle. While she's friendly to everyone, she seems to know a lot about Essie and her life, and it's Essie with whom she really wants to build a friendship. And as Essie's initial unease around Isabelle starts to deepen into something more intense, her family and friends start to get concerned. What does Isabelle want? Why did she move here? The secrets threaten to upend many lives, and roil the relative calm of Pleasant Court.So many people raved about this book, and I was excited to read it not long after it was released. I found it took a while to build up steam, but once Hepworth started ratcheting up the suspense, it became pretty fascinating. I will admit there was one twist I just didn't see coming, and given how many thrillers I read, it's no mean feat to surprise me. The characters are certainly quirky and flawed, but for the most part, the issues they're dealing with are commonplace, so it doesn't feel like you have to suspend your disbelief.I'd imagine this is going to be a book you see lots of people reading over the next few months, as it's a perfect vacation/beach read. This may have been the first of Hepworth's books I've read, but it won't be the last, because she's a talented storyteller, not drowning her story in lots of extraneous subplots, and throwing in enough red herrings to keep you guessing.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."}, {"userName": "Jennifer ~ TarHeelReader & Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32340179-jennifer-tarheelreader-traveling-sister", "userReview": "4 entertaining, dramatic, neighborly stars to The Family Next Door!\ud83c\udfe0 \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f I\u2019ve learned I can rely on Sally Hepworth for a well-written, entertainingly indulgent read. Some of my friends have mentioned that The Family Next Door has a Desperate Housewives feel, and it most definitely does. That angle makes it a little dramatic at times, and some of the things that happened were a bit of a stretch; however, there is an emotionality to Hepworth\u2019s writing that I find exceptionally endearing. You have to keep the tissues handy. The Family Next Door also had a Liane Moriarty Big Little Lies feel to it because it was a little twisty and kept me on my toes. Who are your neighbors?

A rare book where except for one, I felt sorry for and liked the men more than the women.A entertaining read, I have to admit, did want to find out how everyone's relationships turned out, what happened when their secrets were finally revealed. One plot twist was quite surprising, but all in all, a soap opera vibe, which isn't quite my thing.

The more that they struggle, the tighter the grip.Pleasant Court may not be so pleasant after all. Houses in this neighborhood may resemble one another in architectural style, but the occupants differ on so many levels. Smiles produced on long driveways and friendly waves to neighbors diminish once the front doors close. These complicated individuals carry more baggage than the underbelly of a Greyhound bus.Meet Essie who suffers from deep postpartum depression. The cries of her demanding newborn are like a mechanical winch that keeps tightening and tightening until Essie leaves little Mia's pram in the park in order to escape. Thankfully, Essie's mother comes to the rescue, but how long can she be a safety net for the unwinding Essie?Fran and Ange, with those pasted on smiles, have mega issues of their own that will determine the futures of their own families. After all, confiding in others may come at a great cost. How can we allow others to see us as less than best? Barbara, Essie's mother, has moved next door to Essie in order to offer 24/7 support. In her heart, she knows that Essie's life is coming undone at a rapid pace. Sometimes even a mother's love is not enough.Oh, enter Isabel. She's the new young neighbor who has just moved in. Single and immaculately dressed at a moment's notice, Isabel will add quite a dose of jalapeno to these chips. There is definitely something about Isabel here. Is she another fly in the web or is she the crafty spider herself?Sally Hepworth creates quite the neighborhood scene throughout these pages. She allows the readers to peek behind those drawn kitchen curtains in order to get an eye-full. And an eye-full is what we get here. We will meet husbands who go through the motions, challenging children, and untruths that ooze onto kitchen floors. Hepworth keeps you turning pages in order to get a glimpse of the spider's crouching position. Quite the read, folks.

Have you ever noticed when people post on social media they are grabbing their popcorn to watch the drama? That is exactly what The Family Next Door made me want, a nice big bowl of popcorn while I sat back and read the drama that oozed from the residents of Pleasant Court.The story starts off with a flash of Essie\u2019s life as she suffers a breakdown as a new mother. The lack of sleep dealing with a restless baby finally made her snap and she wandered off leaving her baby at the local park. One may ask just how could any loving mother possibly get to that point??But then we dive into the suburb of Pleasant Court a few years later after Essie seems to have gotten her life back on track with the help of therapy. Thankfully her daughter was safe that day and now she has a second baby in her life and hopes to not repeat the past.As a new resident moves into the neighborhood the ladies of Pleasant Court are left wondering just who has joined them. Isabelle is single and childless so she doesn\u2019t exactly fit the family friendly picture of perfection but she quickly dives in and begins to get to know the residents.The story switches the point of view between several of the characters as it dives into the secrets and lies of several of the families of this neighborhood. Along with all of the drama the story has a bit of a mystery involved with the new neighbor and a mysterious missing baby.Practically everyone in the sleepy suburb had things to hide and problems behind their closed doors that kept the drama coming all throughout the story. Much of the story is reminiscent of a daytime soap opera that I just couldn\u2019t turn away from as we take a peek at the lives of the characters in the story but with a bit of mystery mixed in it became even that much more addictive. With great writing and a non stop story I found myself engrossed until the very end and will definitely look for more from this author in the future.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/"}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "Pleasant Court in Melbourne Australia seems like a pleasant place to live...or is it.?

A place where one can smile and wave, believing that everything is okay, everything WILL be okay, everything should be okay...but what happens when it isn't?Have you ever know someone who looks like they have their shit together? Seriously, he/she is the one who looks great, smells great, is healthy, always smiling, always on time, never seems to have a bad day and you envy them...because life is hard and they make it look so easy. Well as they say, you never know what goes on behind closed doors. What drives someone to exercise excessively, what drives someone to always smile even thought their heart is breaking, who acts as if everything is honky dory even thought he/she is harboring a HUGE secret?Every family/person in this book has something to hide.Ange works out, gets her hair and nails done. She wants to look good for her handsome husband. He is a good looking man and women throw themselves at him. Ange wants to -no she needs to look good for him.....Essie once took her daughter to the park and left her there. Her husband and Mother keep close eyes on her to make sure she is \"Okay\" Her mother, Barbara helps her out a lot as she had postpartum depression. She has even moved closer to Essie to help her out. A Mother's job is never done.....Fran runs all the time. Several times a day and she is uncomfortable when her husband is left alone with their youngest daughter. Why? She doesn't seem to care when he is with their eldest. Their marriage seems fine so what is her issue?Isabelle is the single woman who moved into the neighborhood. Single and childless, she sticks out and everyone wonders about her. But Isabelle also wonders about those in her neighborhood. She watches them and makes her observations. It soon becomes evident that not everything is as it seems once you get behind closed doors. Characters have their secrets and as the book unfolds, their secrets come out. Some we see coming and there was one that was a shocker! This was a really enjoyable read. It is fun, the plot moves along at a nice fast pace and nothing felt rushed or drawn out. I felt that the revelations came at just the right time. I liked how the story is told through the various women's point of views. This is a great way to see what is motivating them, what is going on behind that smile, a look at their personal feelings and emotions. We learn their secrets and the secrets of other's in their lives. I have read a couple of Sally Hepwoth's books (The things we keep, The Mother's promise) and have enjoyed them! This is another wonderful book by her. So far she has not disappointed and I will continue to be a happy reader of her work.I received a copy of this book from St. Martin's Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

The Family Next Door is an entertaining, emotional, compelling, and suspenseful domestic thriller that explores the secrets, deceits, and lies of five women who live in a small seemly perfect suburban neighborhood. Sally Hepworth does a good job creating a group of interesting women here with all the secrets and conflicts in their lives and relationships. She also does a great job showing us how the conflicts affected the men in the story, allowing us to feel for them as well. We do really love these types of stories and find them fascinating and often wonder what goes on behind those closed curtains in peoples homes. We enjoyed pulling back the curtains and discovering the layers of secrets as they were revealed leaving us all shocked with a twist that we didn\u2019t see coming. Even though we ended up in the same Coulee a couple of us ended up tangled in the weeds thinking this was a little too much drama. For the rest of us, we ended up soaking up that drama on the sunny side with a nice crisp glass of white wine not wanting to leave. We highly recommend.

Ever thought about what secrets your neighbors try to hide as they close their door and window shades at night? Surely, most of us have and that is the premise of this novel by Sally Hepworth.The people of Pleasant Court have secrets and as we delve into the novel, we learn more and more about what is driving them. Some secrets are those of infidelity, some of a lost child, and some are of the illusions we sometimes see in marriages and relationships. Essie, the main character suffers from postpartum depression but is befriended by a new neighbor, Isabelle, who seems to take quite a big interest in Essie. That interest is returned as Essie seems more and more drawn towards Isabelle. Essie fears she might be harboring a gay relationship. Essie is the mother of two children with a doting husband yet why is there this overwhelming attraction to Isabelle?Then there are the other residents of Pleasant Court. Ange, Fran, and Essie's mother hold within themselves their own secrets. Why is Ange such a controlling person? Why is Fran so afraid to let her husband near her newest child? Finally, why is Barbara, Essie's mother, always so solicitous? All of these questions are answered as the book continues to a somewhat surprising, yet to to this reader, a somewhat hard to believe conclusion.The book is certainly a quick read, but the problem is some of the reasoning behind the secretive nature of the characters seems far fetched. I enjoyed the story however, as it leads one on a journey to find out what their neighbors hid behind their doors.

Well, this time the similarities are well founded, this most definitely will appeal to fans of BLL and I predict it will be a smash hit.This follows five woman who live in the same neighborhood, Essie, Fran, Ange, Barbara and Isabelle so if multiple perspectives are your thing, you\u2019ll be happy with the structure. This was such a fast, effortless read, I tore through it because it was so easy to get caught up in the women\u2019s lives. Plus, they all had juicy secrets and I couldn\u2019t wait to find out what they were hiding.This was one of those books where I thought I had everything figured out and knew exactly what would happen next but Hepworth had plenty of tricks up her sleeve and I didn\u2019t accurately predict anything, I love that!

Sally Hepworth\u2019s latest novel blows apart a seemingly perfect little neighbourhood based in suburbs of Melbourne, exposing a set of families marred by secrets, lies and betrayals. It is a very contemporary look at how our lives may appear to look pleasant on the surface but behind this pristine front often we are battling our own very personal demons.Sally Hepworth settles her latest story in the safe little community of Pleasant Circle. Hepworth introduces us to a set of women who inhabit this slice of suburbia. First we meet Essie, a mother of two young children, who made an awful mistake in throws of new motherhood and sleep deprivation. Despite receiving professional support to help her get over this ordeal, Essie worries that the incident will come back to haunt her. For Essie\u2019s neighbours, life is not smooth sailing either. Close neighbour Ange is a woman who prides herself on her organisation skills but she is having troubles in the marriage and relationship department. So too is fellow neighbour Fran, who is constantly running in the hopes that her troubles will be solved as she pounds the pavement. As these women work through their own personal difficulties, a new resident to Pleasant Circle is about to shake things up. When Isabelle, a single woman from the city settles into this family dominated area, questions begin to arise. The Family Next Door pulls apart relations in families, in marriage, in friendship and in living arrangements, revealing plenty of intriguing secrets along the way.There is no denying Sally Hepworth in an Australian author that leads the way in the category of contemporary women\u2019s fiction or \u2018life lit\u2019 as I prefer to label this genre. Hepworth seems to have a strong sense of intuition in regards to family relationships and her representation of everyday family life is overwhelmingly realistic. What I also love about Sally Hepworth\u2019s writing is her ability to bring pertinent issues in the health and wellbeing department to her readership\u2019s attention, through her compelling novels. The Family Next Door, her latest, is no exception to this rule.At first I was a little apprehensive about the amount of narrators Hepworth embodies in her new novel. There are five different points of view in this novel that alternate as the book progresses. In addition, there is an anonymous narrator which adds a sense of intrigue to the novel, as we try to discover their identity and their connection to the characters of the novel. It took a short time for me the settle into the different voices of the shifting protagonists of this novel. Once I had a firm handle on each different voice, I enjoyed getting to know their individual secrets and the resulting narrative made for a very engaging read.Hepworth\u2019s storytelling skills allowed this reader to appreciate the whole character set of The Family Next Door. I can\u2019t say I liked one story or character over the other, each protagonist earned my sympathy and interest as the book plodded on. I liked the way in which Hepworth slowly offered breadcrumbs as to the heart of each personal mystery. It was very well executed indeed and ensured that I continued to turn the pages of this book at a steady rate.Initially, this book definitely had an entertaining, dark humour style vibe or a Desperate Housewives feel to it. However, beneath the exterior of my first impressions of this novel, is a story that offers so much more. Hepworth uses her latest novel to examine a set of issues that strike at the heart of any neighbourhood or family. She delves into more familiar territory by exploring postpartum depression, mental illness, adultery and paternity. Hepworth branches out further and gives us a glimpse into a case of GSA (genetic sexual attraction). Hepworth\u2019s treatment of all these issues are treated with care, insight and obvious attention to detail in terms of the research she has conducted to form the main themes of her novel.Plenty of twists turns and a surprising turn of events rounds off this novel. There is a main mystery underpinning this novel that bubbles under the surface but it comes to a spectacular head in the final stages of this involving novel. I was completely invested in this book from the opening to the close of this novel. At times, it was hard not to feel like an extra resident on Pleasant Circle, thanks to Sally Hepworth\u2019s writing style, which completes immerses the reader in the lives of these people. A neatly composed ending, filed with moments of hope, happiness and reflection concludes this emotional drama perfectly. A poignant and introspective novel, I highly recommend The Family Next Door and I will continue to endorse the wonderful writing of Sally Hepworth.*I wish to thank Pan Macmillan for providing me with a free copy of this book for review purposes.The Family Next Door is book #16 of the Australian Women Writers Challenge"}, {"userName": "LaDonna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66577665-ladonna", "userReview": "Look in the mirror...Who do you see?...Look in the mirror...Who do you want others to see?\nSally Hepworth was an unknown author to me, until winning this book giveaway.

Most of its residents are married couples with kids. Everything about Pleasent Court appears to be perfect, from the front lawns to the happy couples and their kids. Which is why the arrival of the husbandless and childless Isabelle causes quite a commotion among the neighbours. As the mothers from Pleasent Court try to understand why a single woman would rent a four-bedroom house for herself, their own facades begin to crack. Not everything in this neighbourhood is as pristine it appears to be.For the purposes of being honest, this is not the first time I have come across a book by Sally Hepworth. Last year I started reading 'The Secret of Midwives' but after a few chapters decided to DNF as I was not quite liking the book. The premise of this book fared much better. Pleasent Court is a small suburb perfectly suited to raise a family. The neighbours know each other, the kids can safely play out in the front lawns and the moms are a close knit group. Except that behind closed doors, dark and disturbing secrets lurk. Ange, Fran, and Essie are a group of moms that take a special interest in Isabelle. Each of these women harbor secrets that Isabelle's arrival threaten to expose. I think the pacing of this book was just right in revealing just what each woman was hiding. The book is narrated by Ange, Fran, Essie, Barbara (Essie's mother) and Isabelle. Initially it was somewaht difficult keeping track of who was who but that did not last very long. I thought the multiple POV's suited the book as it brought the readers into all the different households. As a whole, I liked this book.While the short chapters made this a fast read, this was not exactly an easy read. Dealing with postpartum depression, infidelity, motherhood, and just the day to day struggles of maintaining a relationship and raising a family, this book was more complex. The only predictable aspect of this book was that with the name Pleasent Court, well not everything was bound to be pleasent. The secrets, while not unique, were presented in a fashion that actually surprised. I did have some trouble believing certain scenarios presented in the book but generally speaking it was not a deterrent to keep reading on. There is a Desperate Housewives vibe to this book and judging by other reviews, relatable characters (I would not know because my children are furry and meow so I can not relate to the moms and their personal struggles).
