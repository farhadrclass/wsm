Dear readers, please come dance with the go-fast devil...\u201cJust reading the table of contents for this fucker makes me want to hop in my time machine, zoom back to 1966 and find those two dubious physicians who used to write me scripts for Dexedrine, even though I was too tall and skinny to live already. Mainline this book now!\u201d\u2014JAMES ELLROYTHE SPEED CHRONICLESEdited by JOSEPH MATTSONFeaturing 14 NEW short fiction stories about the drug speed by SHERMAN ALEXIE, WILLIAM T. VOLLMANN, JERRY STAHL, MEGAN ABBOTT, BETH LISICK, JESS WALTER, SCOTT PHILLIPS, JAMES GREER, JAMES FRANCO, TAO LIN, JOSEPH MATTSON, NATALIE DIAZ, KENJI JASPER, and ROSE BUNCH.Speed: The most demonized\u2014and misunderstood\u2014drug in the land. Deprived of the ingrained romantic mysticism of the opiate or the cosmopolitan chic of cocaine or the mundane tolerance of marijuana, there is no sympathy for this devil. Yet, speed\u2014crystal meth, amphetamines, Dexedrine, Benzedrine, Adderall; crank, fuzz, chickenscratch, OBLIVION marching powder, the go fast\u2014is the most American of drugs: twice the productivity at half the cost, and equal opportunity for all. It feels so good and hurts so bad. From its dueling roots of pharmaceutical miracle cure and Californian biker gang scourge to contemporary Ivy League campuses and high school chem labs, punk rock clubs to the military industrial complex, suburban households to tin can ghettos, it crosses all ethnicities, genders, and geographies\u2014from immigrants and heartlanders punching double factory shifts to clandestine border warlords, doctors to bomber pilots, prostitutes to housewives, T-girls to teenagers, Academy Award-nominated actors and the mansion on the hill to the poorest Indian on the rez\u2014making it not only the most essentially American narcotic, but the most deceivingly sundry literary matter.Some shoot for angst-curing kicks, some snort for sad endurance, some for explosive joyrides into the unknown because, no matter how delicious dying young might seem, they want to live forever.The subject of speed is so innately intimidating yet so undeniably present that it begs to be written about. It is no secret that the drug has historically tuned up the lives of writers, including Jack Kerouac, Susan Sontag, Philip K. Dick, and scores more. Too rarely, though, has it been written about, and its jolt to the bones of the American landscape continues to peak. Akashic Books dares to bring forth the first contemporary collection of all new literary short fiction on the drug from an array of today\u2019s most compelling and respected authors. These are no stereotypical tales of tweakers\u2014the element of crime and the bleary-eyed, shaky zombies at dawn are here right alongside heartwrenching narratives of everyday people, good intentions gone terribly awry, the skewed American Dream going up in flames, and even some account of pure joy."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2253702-joanna", "userReview": "Yes! Okay, so this is the meth book that I was looking for. THIS is Breaking Bad. Okay, well, no, not really. But the energy, humor, and OTT plotlines (AKA parts I found most interesting in Breaking Bad) are here, and not the usual pervasive mopeyness and scoldings I have found in other books about drugs, like drug memoirs and drug journalism. BORING! The stories were all pretty good to excellent, too, except for one story, by that... uh... that actor guy who does pretentious \"art\" stunts for the lulz? except no one thinks they are really funny; the art seems more like in-jokes between him and his best friend, himself. OMG, John Franco. JAMES Franco. It was terrible. It was literally the worst short story in a collection I have ever read. It was about Twilight. Like, he watched the movie and then wrote exactly what he saw in the screen. And that is somehow like speed or meth or something. You know what, he was probably on speed or meth or something when he did that; it sounds like something he would do. ugh. I'm tired of that kind of gimmickry; like, instead of actually taking risks and putting themselves \"out there\" all I see is a wall of clever protecting the author/artist from criticism. Not just the \"good/bad\" kind, the \"deep reading\" kind too. Ugh. He's cute though. Tao Lin's story was a little bit of that, too. Boring story about young hip New Yorkers when taking adderall and other drugs = young hip New Yorkers when taking adderall and other drugs are boring. Wow! Real groundbreaking (sarcasm font). The best story was Sherman Alexie's. He wrote about the rez (duh) and family/community (duh) and drugs (duh) and created just about the only piece in this collection that escaped the emotional/narrative confines of writing a story about drugs. Do not fear cliches and tropes, writers! Use them well and you can communicate better (which is the point, you guys). I also liked the story about Dr. Feelgood. Other stories were doing the uh... William Burroughs or Bret Easton Ellis thing, which was pretty decent most of the time if a bit like... okay, that again (i guess that is what you do when do write drug stories). And now I want to watch Breaking Bad again."}, {"userName": "Tuck", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565487-tuck", "userReview": "a rather hit-n-miss group of noir short stories (richmond noir, salt lake city noir, spokane noir, oklahoma city noir, etc [a joke, please]) books has finally come home to it's hard hitting roots (\n , \n ) with a new collection highlighting speed, meth, go fast, hillbilly dentistry, whatever you might call it. editor joseph mattson has brought together a great and diverse group of writers to tell us stories about speed old and new. it;s a fast read too, one can buzz through it in just a few moments. hah. all are winners, from Scott Phillips signature style of matter-of-fact revenge, to megan abbott's stylish justifications for drugs as help-metes(sp?) to mattson's own vibrating scores and just WHERE? will one draw the line in fuckedupedness. cold and frosty stories to warm your noir needs."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141982-jim", "userReview": "Los Angeles author Joseph Mattson is no stranger to Bukowski comparisons. His collection, Eat Hell, published by Narrow Books, investigates the lives of down-and-out Angelenos. The novel Empty the Sun, which comes with a soundtrack performed by Six Organs of Admittance, circles the drain with a down-and-out blues-guitar player who hits bottom in downtown L.A. after his index finger is chewed off by a police dog.His latest effort is an anthology published by Akashic Books called The Speed Chronicles: 14 stories about America\u2019s equal-opportunity drug. There\u2019s a surprising range of emotions on display here, from horror to humor, with contributions from Jerry Stahl, William T. Vollman, James Greer and even James Franco. With the exception of an exceptionally weak offering from Sherman Alexie, these stories are, as Mattson describes in his introduction, \u201cheart-wrenching narratives of everyday people, good intentions gone terribly awry, and the skewed American Dream going up in flames.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151601-tony", "userReview": "Indie publisher Akashic hit it big with its city-based \"Noir\" collections (D.C. Noir, Mumbai Noir, etc.), and looks to repeat that success with a new series of drug-themed collections. This one contains fourteen original stories about speed, which, the introduction asserts is \"the most demonized -- and misunderstood -- drug in the land.\" (Although editor Mattson struggles mightily for a page or two emphasize the complexity of the amphetamine experience, that framing comes across as somewhat forced to someone who's never partaken.) In the broadest terms, the stories can be divided between those that aspire to impart some sense of the drug through their style or construction, those that place the drug use within the realm of the everyday world, and those that are positioned in a more conventional realistic crime milieu. And again, it may be the bias of the straight-edge kid within me, but I found the former (including stories by William Vollman, Jerry Stahl, Natalie Diaz, James Greer and James Franco) completely uninteresting, and borderline unreadable.The second batch are moderately interesting, such as Megan Abbott's story of an angel of mercy doctor whose prescriptions are an attempt to provide relief and happiness; or Tao Lin's deadpan chronicle of New York hipsters schlepping around town on Adderall; Beth Lisick's first-person narration by a Martha Stewartish housewife prepping for a party; and Rose Bunch's description of another middle-class housewife's uneasy relationship with her sketchy meth-cooking neighbors. My favorite stories, however, were those that for better or for worse, hew closest to expectations. These are basically all tales of deals gone bad: Kenji Jasper's \"Osito,\" Scott Phillips's \"Labiodental Frictive,\" editor Mattson's own story, and Sherman Alexie's rez-set \"War Cry.\" The best in the book is \"Wheelbarrow Kings\" Jess Walter's darkly comic story of two users struggling to get some cash together to score on the mean streets of Spokane.As with most anthologies, each reader's individual results will vary and hopefully you'll be find a contributor or two you'll want to explore further. (In my case, I already like Jess Walter, and heartily recommend his book Citizen Vince, also set in Spokane.) And while the stories more or less manage to convey the diversity of experience amphetamines can provide, I'm not really sure they'll lead to greater understanding than watching a season or two of Breaking Bad."}, {"userName": "Brandon Cerny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6915404-brandon-cerny", "userReview": "**This book was given to me for free through Goodreads First Reads**Having a very brief exposure to Chrystal-Meth, this book rang very true to many of the meth-heads I have met and the stories they told.

Each short story was an adventure into addiction and the various forms it can take. I will certainly recommend this book to my friends.The only portion of the book that I found sadly lacking, was the piece submitted by James Franco.

A doctor is arrested for prescribing illegal and undisclosed drugs to his patients, after it all goes tragically wrong; his (remaining) patients are on his side. Not really about speed per se, I think, but that's not the point. The doctor is kindly and unreliable; the slippage between normal unreliable perception and drug-induced unreliability is well-done.

Rated 2.0 of 5I truly didn't know what I was getting into when I requested this book. I wasn't aware that there was a series of drug-related short fiction books. (Yes, I am naive enough to think that this might have been about things that move quickly!) WHat attracted me to the book, though, were some of the names of the authors who has stories here. Names such as Sherman Alexia, James Franco, and Megan Abbott.As Joseph Mattson reminds us in his introduction, drug use has certainly played a factor in the lives of some writers, such as Jack Kerouac, Susan Sontag, and Philip K. Dick, and so it makes a certain sense to pay homage to this chemical muse. But I would have to say that the Puritan part of me (the boring part of me?) takes issue with any sort of promoting of illicit drugs. Though the stories here do not all necessarily promote or encourage drug use.The book is divided into sections: Madness; Machination; Methodology; Medicine.This is an anthology of stories by different authors and it's typical that I found some of the stories to be interesting or engaging, while others were flat and lifeless. Unfortunately, there were too many of the latter in this instance. Perhaps it has a lot to do with the fact that I just can't relate to most of these people?Sherman Alexie's \"War Cry\" was the clear standout in this collection as a meth-induced war dancer on the rez goes ... well ... on the war-path.\"How to Go to Dinner with a Brother on Drugs\" by Natalie Diaz definitely defines the madness in the section heading, and takes on a real trip.These are the first two stories in the collection and so it opens quite promisingly, but we tend to go down from there. Except for Jess Walter's \"Wheelbarrow Kings\" and \"Everything I Want\" by Megan Abbot and \"No Matter How Beautifully it Strings\" by William T. Vollmann (and maybe the editor's own \"Amp Is the First Word in Amphetamine\"), the rest of the stories disappear into obscurity.There really isn't enough here to justify the price of admission, proving once again that drug use can be an expensive, bad habit.This collection contains the following:Introduction: Some Gods, Some Panthers - Joseph MattsonPart I: Madness\"How to Go to Dinner with a Brother on Drugs\" - Natalie Diaz\"War Cry\" - Sherman Alexie\"Bad\" - Jerry StahlPart II: Machination\"Labiodental Fricative\" - Scott Phillips\"Osito\" - Kanji Jasper\"Amp Is the First Word in Amphetamine\" - Joseph Mattson\"Addiction\" - James FrancoPart III: Methodology\"Wheelbarrow Kings\" - Jess Walter\"Tips 'n' Things by Elayne\" - Beth Lisick\"Pissing in Perpetuity\" - Rose Bunch\"51 Hours\" - Tao LinPart IV: Medicine\"Everything I Want\" - Megan Abbott\"The Speed of Things\" - James Greer\"No Matter How Beautifully It Strings\" - William T.

I didn't really think Speed and Meth were the same. And, while, technically, they're different, they pretty much have the same effects (so says the editor of this collection and is confirmed by yahoo answers...). That being said, I still think the better title for this book would have been \"The Meth Chronicles.\" But I guess that's why I'm not an editor! For me, the stories were extremely hit-or-miss. I suppose that's what you're going to get with pretty much any short story collection with a bunch of different authors. And, I'm not going to lie. The reason this book was on my to-read list was because James Franco had a story in it. Sadly, it is, by far, the worst story in the collection. In fact, it's one of the worst short stories I've ever read. I thought the collection started out with a real bang. I mean, how can you go wrong with a dedication like this: \"This book is dedicated to the liver--the vital organ and the daring spirit.\"?I was somewhat put off by the introduction, because I came into the book thinking, \"Speed (and all drugs) are BAD!\" So, Mattson's seeming ok-ness with the drug made me a little wary. The first story from Natalie Diaz was phenomenal. It's packed with emotion, and it's easy to relate to. Sheman Alexie's story was also quite moving and beautifully written. Jerry Stahl's story was probably my favorite, as it is written from the point of view of someone actually on speed, and it's extremely convincing. Those were the three standouts for me. After that, there were some pretty good stories that reminded me of Requiem for a Dream and Waiting Period and Bret Easton Ellis and the like. Overall, I'd recommend giving this book a shot, but I'd probably also recommend that you skip James Franco's story and just go ahead and remove all his books from your to-read list."}, {"userName": "Shannon Barber", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/399339-shannon-barber", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of the series Akashic does. The drug chronicles, the Noir series etc. This one did not disappoint at all. I really enjoyed how the book was organized, editor Joseph Mattson chose well and ordered the pieces in a way that kept up the Speedy momentum. I will say that I did not really like Franco's addition. The glossy pages with the two pieces laid out that way detracted from how the rest of the book was put together.
