Just a heads up: this is the second Ethan Gage saga, so there may be spoilers to Napoleon's Pyramids in this review.I'll admit: it took me a minute to warm up to these books. I thought that Ethan Gage was a bit pretentious and the story a little implausible in the first book, and had trouble getting past that. BUT once you decide to just sit back and enjoy the ride, these books are such fun! Yes, Ethan is still a bit pretentious, but I think that's at least partly due to the historicity of the books. They're set in the late 1700s, when upper class white males did honestly think themselves better than most other people. And when Ethan repeatedly refers to himself as a \"savant,\" he's not being snobbish (in that moment); he's using the word in the historic, literal sense, and telling us that he's well-educated and well-read. The Rosetta Key also continues to be pretty implausible, but it's fiction. Go ahead and let yourself be carried along on the adventure and you won't regret it!The Rosetta Key finds Ethan still in the Middle East, but this time in Jerusalem. He's looking for the Book of Throth, to keep it from falling into the wrong (Napoleon's) hands. Along the way, he also hopes to find Astiza. If you remember, he lost her when she fell from the hot air balloon into the Nile. I assumed her dead.... I have now learned a lesson in keeping up hope! Especially in fiction. ;) Turns out she's alive and well and needs to be found. Ethan practically singlehandedly fights off the British and the French and the king of Egypt in order to outsmart them all in following the clues and finding the Book of Throth. (I warned you that it's slightly implausible.) With this one, though, I let all logic fly out the window and ended up loving seeing how Ethan would tackle each new problem or puzzle that arose. I cheered for him whenever he'd solve a clue or overcome an obstacle, and laughed at some of his naivete in some social situations. There's a whole scene involving two women that I found particularly amusing. :)Then the book ends... with a heavy hint at the next Ethan Gage adventure! I've already downloaded The Dakota Cipher to listen to next! Got to see where that crazy Ethan Gage ends up.I listened to The Rosetta Key, as opposed to reading a physical book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The narrator gives Ethan a voice that seems real, and does believable, noncondescending accent for the foreign characters. The cadence and pacing feel good: not too fast and not too slow. I would certainly recommend this audiobook."}, {"userName": "Benjamin Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas", "userReview": "This is the second fast-paced rollicking historical adventure featuring Ethan Gage. A former student of Benjamin Franklin, Gage has survived the adventures recounted in Napoleon's Pyramids and has now engaged upon a search for a legendary Egyptian scroll, the Book of Thoth, in the Middle East. The action takes place among the backdrop of Napoleon's 1799 campaign along the coast of Palestine as he tries to emulate the success of Alexander the Great and make inroads to Asia. Ethan and his cohorts participate (sometimes accidentally) in warfare at Acre, Jaffa, and the Battle of Mount Tabor. Several historical personages make an appearance here including Sir Sydney Smith, General Phelipeaux, Haim Farhi, and Djezzar. Gage's time in the Holy Land is, of course, fraught with danger as one adventure leads to the next. Just when he manages to extricate himself from one near fiasco he falls into the next. He is often driven by his love for a woman...or sometimes, it is for the love of a different woman. Most of what happens to him is not by his own design but somehow always manages to land him where he needs to be. Sort of a cross between Indiana Jones and Maxwell Smart. He suffers from extremely bad luck on multiple occasions but, fortunately, this is balanced by extremely good luck when his life is at stake.The thing I find intriguing about this character is not so much his swashbuckling adventurer side, but rather, his scientific side. As a student of Ben Franklin, Gage has absorbed a thirst for scientific knowledge as well as a gift for applying his knowledge in practical ways. His innovative use of electricity from crude batteries actually turns the tide of battle in one scene.I'm enjoying these adventure novels and looking forward to the next."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170420-laura", "userReview": "This book has it all: Indiana Jones-type escapes, the Knights Templar, Petra, Napoleon... all topped off with bad writing and plotting.

I enjoyed this second story of American adventurer, Ethan Gage, and his misadventures. The ending of the book leads the reader to believe that there will be further stories of Ethan. I look forward to the next one.Ethan Gage accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte to Egypt in Napoleon's Pyramids. Now Ethan is trying to find out if Astiza, the Egyptian woman he has come to love, survived a fall from a hot air balloon into a river. He is also looking for a magical book that is rumored to exist, The Book of Throth. Ethan's quest for the fate of Astiza and the magical book is filled with travel, adventure, and betrayal. Ethan makes new allies and must face his old enemies once again. The Rosetta Key seemed even more action packed to me than Napoleon's Pyramids. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical adventure stories.

Sometimes it\u2019s great to just sit back and have fun. And that is what Ethan Gage is all about. Pure, unadulterated, engaging fun. The Rosetta Key picks up right where Napoleon\u2019s Pyramids left off. Gage and his lady love, Astiza, discovered secret chambers beneath the Great Pyramid, where the long-lost Book of Thoth \u2013 an ancient source of unlimited wisdom and power \u2013 once resided. Believing the Book was carried out of Egypt by Moses during the Exodus, they planned to head to the Holy Land to discover its fate. But their own fates got in the way. The last Gage saw Astiza, she was plunging into the Nile from the hot air balloon they appropriated to escape the evil Alessandro Silano \u2013 who also seeks the Book of Thoth for his own evil purposes (how common) \u2013 and Gage finds himself rescued by the British Navy on their way to the Holy Land to stop Napoleon\u2019s planned invasion.The Rosetta Key kicks off from the get-go with the affable Gage struggling to continue the quest on his own. The British think he\u2019s seeking a treasure that will stop Napoleon in his tracks. The French think he\u2019s seeking the Book of Thoth to endow Napoleon with unlimited power. And all Gage wants to do is find the darn thing and go home without getting shot by either side. As he races across the Holy Land, he finds himself caught right in the middle of Napoleon\u2019s invasion, and some of its most noteworthy moments, including the tragic slaughter at Jaffa (where Napoleon executed thousands of Muslim prisoners of war) and the devastating Battle of Acre, where the British soundly defeated the French in brutal combat. Gage also visits some of the Holy Land\u2019s most incredible sites, including the Temple Mount and the ancient city of Petra, and every step brings him closer to the most important artifact in the history of mankind.This sounds like a plot for an Indiana Jones movie, but as with Napoleon\u2019s Pyramids, The Rosetta Key is not a deep, thought-provoking, gut-wrenching read that transforms your outlook on life. It\u2019s a thrill ride on a rollercoaster of adventure and history with lots of laughs in between. Set against the backdrop of Napoleon\u2019s real-life 1799 invasion of the Holy Land \u2013 which he hoped would bring him one step closer to conquering the known world in the tradition of Alexander the Great \u2013 The Rosetta Key is a rip-roaring good time with lots of fun new characters, including a new love interest for Mr. Gage, and page-turning suspense. My favorite, however, remains Ethan Gage himself. A wandering, gambling, roguish ladies man who somehow always manages to survive, even when he shouldn\u2019t, is one heck of a great character to read. I laugh out loud at his comments, like this gem from page 5: \u201cI\u2019d taken fire from Mameluke cavalry, the woman I loved, Arab cutthroats, British broadsides, Muslim fanatics, French platoons\u2014and I\u2019m a likable man!\u201d And I relish reading his crazy adventures.On to Book 3!"}, {"userName": "Francis Gahren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19548109-francis-gahren", "userReview": "In \u201cNapoleon\u2019s Pyramids,\u201d American adventurer Ethan Gage learned that a secret book powerful enough to change world history had been spirited out of the Great Pyramid.

I needed a new audio book to listen to and I have liked the adventure stories, aka Indian Jones series, so I thought I'd give this a try.Genre: Adventure (#2 in the Ethan Gage series - I didn't read #1)Blurb: (From Goodreads) Surviving murderous thieves, a nerve-racking sea voyage, and the deadly sands of Egypt with Napoleon's army, American adventurer Ethan Gage solved a five-thousand-year-old riddle with the help of a mysterious medallion. But the danger is only beginning. . . .Gage finds himself hurled into the Holy Land in dogged pursuit of an ancient Egyptian scroll imbued with magic, even as Bonaparte launches his 1799 invasion of Israel, which will climax at the epic siege of Acre. Pursuing Napoleon to France, where the general hopes ancient secrets will catapult him to power, the wily and inventive Gage faces old enemies with unlikely new friends, and must use wit, humor, derring-do, and an archaeological key to prevent dark powers from seizing control of the world.What I didn't like: Sometimes all the riddles and puzzles were a bit confusing, though maybe this is so you don't think about them to much so you don't see that they are just a lot of guessing or hoping on the character's parts. The main thing that was disappointing was after they went through quite a lot to get the item they were seeking, the item is just one of 10 or so items (I forgot the exact number) and is like a table of contents for these items. It isn't the wealth or knowledge they worked so hard to get. (I don't want to give anything away her so I am being vague). I ending is also a bit blah - doesn't really make we want to pick up the next book. I could, it would be an okay read, but not a must have. (Oh, and as an aside - Ethan Gage, the main rouge in the story, sleeps with a virgin he proposes to love then leaves her without so much as a kiss goodbye. Bad man. Very Bad man. The author tries to redeem him by having him propose to said woman later in the story, but I still don't buy it. No redemption in my eyes.)What I liked: It was well written - good dialogue, generally good story, it definitely moves right along. Very creative scenes, and as many characters repeat throughout the story, it seems that Ethan Gage can not be killed. It's okay though, you do want him to carry on, and his near death experiences are not too far-fetched. It was nice that I didn't have to read the first book to enjoy this one. I also liked the narrator, Jeff Woodman. He did a very convincing job.Rating: 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "C\u00e9line", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4862798-c-line", "userReview": "[Ethan Gage est de retour, cette fois-ci, en Terre Sainte.

There are three requirements, in my opinion, that an exceptional adventure novel should possess. 1. A well-developed, affable protagonist who has unique identifiable personality traits and characteristics in which to draw the reader into his/her quest as a sojourning ally. 2. The action should be congruent and fluid, ever heightening without redundancy, propelling the reader enthusiastically along towards a climatic resolve. 3. Show me, don't tell me; fiction is a dramatization in motion, not a journalistic reporting of events. The beginning of this novel showed great potential. Protagonist and narrator, Ethan Gage, is presented as a wry, witty, affable, intellectual adventurer. The purpose for his quest is clearly brought to light and seems to be a considerably noble, though slightly selfish, endeavor. Additionally, the initial action scene is engaging and inclusive to the reader. Shortly thereafter though, narrative voice and congruity and fluidity become a chaotic mishmash.  In between action sequences, the narrative voice is easily identifiable as Ethan Gage. However, when the action heats up, the book reads more like a fact-reporting news account or a droning play-by-play barker. Then when the action cools - witty, gung-ho Gage is back telling his story. With each repeated break in Gage's character voice, I found myself disconnecting from him more and more.  As for congruent fluid-motion, it just wasn't there. The story would be swashbuckling along at a good clip then suddenly bow-up to a near halt, for no apparent reason other than to \"inform\" the reader about some related pertinent \"information.\" There were so many disjointed breaks it caused me to lose momentum and interest.  Yes, the novel as a whole was disappointing for me. However, certain aspects of the book were quite good. The mechanics and bones of the story were noteworthy. The plot was plausible and solid, with historically relevant geographical locations and characters presented authentically. There are some great one-liners written throughout, along with some great Ben Franklin quotes.

I didn't read book one of the series and perhaps I would have appreciated book 2 better had I read that first. Regardless, it was a good book but not a great book. Ethan Gage is the main character. He calls himself a savant. He is an adventurer in the late 1700s. He finds himself in Egypt and Israel in search of the book of Thoth as well as his lost love (from the previous book) Astiza. Although the book was an okay read, I probably needed to see it as a movie to appreciate the action. Gage finds himself in situations that you think that no one could possibly survive and yet he does. Time and time again be prepared for death threats by unusual means. I've always wondered why the bad guy doesn't just kill their nemesis instead of having him slowly die by bizarre methods from which he manages to get away anyway. In the beginning of the book he is already in front of a firing squad and we read the words being said, \"Ready, Aim, FIre\". I think that is my only frustration with an otherwise action packed novel. i particularly enjoyed the side characters more than the main character. Many of them were former enemies that became friends. Mohammed and Ned were interesting people. I also enjoyed Jericho and his sister, Miriam. I would loved to have read more about them in the novel. One thing that I do appreciate about this book is the way the author infused real historical events within the novel. It is a good read when I find myself wanting to learn more about the history of what I've read. Thank goodness I live with a \"historian\" of sorts who gave me great background knowledge of Napoleon as well as what was going on in the Americas at that time. I particularly enjoyed reading the Afterword in which the author stated which facts were historical and which were just made up for novel purposes. Did you know that Notre Dame Cathedral was located on a site of a Roman temple to Isis? I didn't.

Great adventure woven from history, think Indiana Jones in the Napoleonic Wars! This latest book takes place almost entirely in Egypt in the year 1799 and Napoleon is in the midst of his invasion of Israel. Ethan Gage is our hero and is in and out of trouble so fast and often it is hard to keep up with his sometimes hilarious and always stunning escapes. Here we have a classical treasure hunt in the deserts of Egypt. The book is historically very accurate, and the treasure may indeed exist as has been rumored for centuries. Our protagonist finds himself \u201cswitching sides\u201d through no fault of his own and with no political intention, constantly. The only political agenda of his is to find the object of his search and protect it or destroy it to keep it from the \u201cwrong\u201d hands while trying to find out what happened to his lost love Astiza. Other than the fact he is always avoiding execution, Evan is forever finding the girl, losing the girl, and finding the girl again. Since Evan is also a gambler, perhaps the saying is true, \u2018lucky at cards, unlucky at love\u2019!

At the end of the previous book, he found himself on a British ship heading for the Holy Land. He agrees to help the British slow down, or stop, Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s coming invasion (the British don\u2019t give him a choice). In the meantime, he continues to look for the Book of Thoth, an ancient scroll of great power that Moses supposedly stole from Egypt, and brought to Jerusalem.Gage is an American and protege of Benjamin Franklin, so he knows something about electricity. He puts his knowledge to use more than once, including during a major French siege of the city of Acre (present-day Lebanon). Gage switches sides between the French and British, more than once, and not by choice. He cheats death more than once, mostly because there are enough people who hear that Gage is looking for an ancient scroll and automatically think \"gold and treasure.\"Throughout much of the book, Gage has a big hole in his heart. At the end of the previous book, he watched Astiza, his Egyptian lover, fall from a hot-air balloon into the Nile River, in the clutches of Count Alessandro Silano. They are presumed dead, but Gage has to know for sure. In this story are also Jewish mysticism, the Knights Templar, the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, and enough action and narrow escapes to satisfy anyone.Here is an excellent piece of writing.

In the first book he wins a medallion in a card game which may be the key to ancient treasure and he is set upon by archrival Count Silano (Boo!!!) to give up the medallion. This leads to a chase across the county where Ethan becomes involved with Napoleons attempt to conquer the world.\"The Rosetta Key\" takes place in Egypt and the Holy Land. Ethan is on a search for the treasure of the Knights Templar. The treasure may well be the Book of Thoth, an ancient Egyptian scroll inbued with magical powers.Ethan is also in search of Astiza, the woman he fell in love with but lost at the end of \"Napoleon's Pyramids\". This is complicated when he also falls in love with Miriam, a woman he encounters in the Holy Land.These books are entertaining and informative. The are well written and will leave the reader anxiously waiting for the continued adventures of Ethan Gage."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41506741-jackie", "userReview": "One of the best examples of why Mary Sue characters are intolerable.

I never read the first one - big mistake. Granted the author keeps referring to what had happened to these characters earlier - so I was caught up.This is a Da Vinci Code type book - people are searching for an artifact all around the world. This artifact will change the world. With all of that, and the battle scenes and the romances, it was not all that interesting. They're searching for the Book of Thoth (I have a copy on MY shelf...) which might be how the Templars got rich ... oh, them again.Having read so many books about these topics, I feel as if I'd read this already. Usually finding the same information again is a plus, this time, I felt it was just repetitive.Partly I couldn't warm up to the main character, an American, who kept switching allegiance from Britain to France during the ongoing war.I can't recommend this book very highly - it is definitely escape reading.*edit*I got the strong sense that the book was waiting to be picked up as a movie deal. There were sections that reminded me of the National Treasure movies and some was similar in feel (not actual content) to the movie of the Clive Cussler book, Sahara. Lots of chasing, lots of betrayal, lots of competition... All that and still not exciting for me."}, {"userName": "J.

Pegged as an \"Indiana Jones-like adventure,\" I really wanted to like it. The title sounds great! Unfortunately, I did not realize when I got it from the library that it was book 2 in a series. Yet unlike other serial books, this book does not adequately sum up what happens before so readers can be up to date on the present storyline. I read \"Hand of Isis\" which is actually the second book of that author, which relates back to her previous, \"Black Ships.\" \"Grave Goods\" by Ariana Franklin is another example of book three in a series that is easily a stand-alone novel as well. This book did not transition the readers into the story. The opening few pages were good attention grabbers. Good opening portion. But afterwards I found I just did not like the main character. All he ever talked about was his \"pride\" on remaining celibate because he's in love (so excited for you, man) and his friend Ben Franklin. I got so sick of hearing \"My friend, Ben Franklin, once said...\" I got about 1/4-way into it and decided it was not worth the effort anymore. The characters were shallow and the plot was too slow to develop in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246025-jessica", "userReview": "A fun read, in the manner of the Da Vinci Code and the multiple other historical thrillers that have become so popular. This one is a bit different in that it takes place in the 17th century instead of the present day, and features an American adventurer who runs all over the Middle East and Europe. He escapes from all manner of danger and battles in inplausible fashion. And for some reason, those in power love him in spite of his many changes of side. He also falls in love with and has fall in love with him several beautiful, mysterious women.I do wish that these sort of historical thrillers didn't always hinge on the mystery of the Knights Templar. Surely there must be some other secret societies in the world for people to write about! This book does throw in some Egyptian mysteries as well, so there is a tiny bit of variety.This is the second book in a series about this Ethan Gage. I have not read the first one, though I plan to now, and I understood what was going on pretty well.I recommend this for a fun summer read."}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20451415-philip", "userReview": "Well, it's not bad. But got a bit samey as it went on. You know how it goes - man loses woman, man finds woman, man rescues woman. Man survives a massacre, man gets captured again and switches sides. Senn and heard it all before. This book is the second of a series concerning the American adventurer Ethan Gage.The actual prize - the so-called Book of Thoth - doesn't actually do anything to or for anybody. I suspect if this book relied on this alone then it wouldn't work. There's plenty of action throughout amidst the backdrop of Napoleon's invasion of Syria and Palestine.If you like a Napoleonic version of Indiana Jones then you'll like this series but I find the novelty of this period starts to wane by the end of, this the second book, and I feel no immediate reason to pursue the third installment. I'll come across it no doubt in a few years time in a charity shop.You tight bastard."}, {"userName": "Iowa City Public Library", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427891-iowa-city-public-library", "userReview": "If Napoleon\u2019s Pyramids evoked Indiana Jones (and it did), what could be more natural than a sequel?
