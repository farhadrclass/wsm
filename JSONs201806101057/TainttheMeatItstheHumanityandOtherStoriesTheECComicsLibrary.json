The stories were originally published in issues #23 (1951) to #46 (1955). The difference between these pre-comics code stories and the post-code monster stories of just a few years later is amazing. It's easy to imagine the post-code stories targeting 10-13 year olds; but the target audience of these post code stories would seem much older.Unfortunately, there's a fair bit of overlap between this collection and Gemstone's recent hardbound EC reprints. The first 6 stories were reprinted in The EC Archives: Tales from the Crypt, Vol. 2 and; and the second 6 in The EC Archives: Tales from the Crypt, Vol. 3.One interesting difference between the two reprints is that these are in black & white, while the Gemstone reprints are recolored. It'd be fun to get an original printing of one of the common stories & compare all three versions. Mostly I prefer colored comics, but Jack Davis's highly detailed line art is a pleasure to see in B/W.According to the copyright page this is Volume 4 of The Fantagraphics EC Artists' Library. I'm not planning on buying all the other volumes in the Library, but I've already ordered the Wally Wood volume and will probably order more."}, {"userName": "Skjam!", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4401570-skjam", "userReview": "EC Comics was for a short time a brilliant publisher of crime, SF and especially horror comics in the early 1950s. One of the things that made them so great was having some of the best artists working in the field at the time. This book collects several stories artistically rendered by Jack Davis, particularly from the Tales From the Crypt series.Mr. Davis had a great line in rotting corpses, feral rats and ugly-natured humans. This is a black and white reprint, which allows his use of strong blacks to be shown to advantage. (He went on to a long, successful career in other comics areas after horror comics were gutted by the Comics Code.)EC\u2019s horror titles were notorious for their twist endings, and horrible puns. The title story is no exception, being about a World War Two-era butcher who gets tempted by the money of the black market. Other standouts include \u201cThe Trophy!\u201d about a hunter who only kills animals for bragging rights (two versions, one done originally for a 3-D comic!), \u201cGas-tly Prospects!\u2019 about a murdered prospector that won\u2019t stay buried, and \u201cLower Berth\u201d with (at the time) the most unexpected twist of all.There\u2019s also some biographical material about Mr. Davis, whose life was thankfully nothing like the stories he illustrated.This is classic stuff, and highly recommended for teenagers and up. (Some scenes may be a little intense for preteens.)"}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119733-ryan", "userReview": "This is classic EC comics by one of the most prolific comic artists ever. I usually just write these reviews for myself to keep track of what I have read. I hate it when someone reads a book and puts in a description of the book in their review. Do people think they are part of some book review club? A description of the book is already in the details. Anyway, I'll get off my rant rant to do some of the same... Jack Davis got into commercial illustration not long after this stuff was done in the 50s and continued until maybe the past 10 years. His commercial illustrations are everywhere. What a reader will see in this book shows Davis perfecting his style.The silly writing and predictable twists in Tales From the Crypt sometimes make it hard to stomach. At least for me. But the amazing art and great character design are nice to look at. The fact that this book is published in black and white is a help, not a hindrance to Davis' art. I'm not sure I can say the same for other reprint collections that Fantagraphics will be rolling out over the next couple of years. But the publisher knows what they are doing. This book is printed at just the right size to compliment the art and the book design and quality is top notch."}, {"userName": "Stewart Tame", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame", "userReview": "Ah, Jack Davis ... Lovely art, which you'd expect. This is a collection of some of his work for the various EC horror titles of the 1950s. The stories are arranged chronologically, and you can see Davis' signature style just isn't quite there in the earliest tales. There are also two versions of \"The Trophy,\" which was re-done for a 3-D comic book years after it first appeared. Having the two versions to compare is an excellent lesson in storytelling as one can see what choices were made differently to make the second version flow better. Some of the writing isn't the best--the ending of the story about the trunk comes totally out of left field, for instance--but Davis' art is a delight throughout."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67918-maureen", "userReview": "My faves are the grave-robbing yarn Bargain in Death and Upper Berth, the crypt-keeper's origin story."}, {"userName": "Andreas Strom", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912249-andreas-strom", "userReview": "Classic stories from Tales From The Crypt.

I love these new Fantagraphics reprints of the E.C. comics. They are reproduced in black & white, which makes the artist's line work very clear. Each book is devoted to a single artist, and the presentation seems to be more or less chronological, so you can see the artist's development during the brief span of E.C.'s heyday (i.e., before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency put William Gaines in the hot seat and all the comic book distributors refused to touch E.C. and its competitors in the horror comics field).I have the first Fantagraphics slip-cased set, which also includes volumes dedicated to the work of Williamson, Kurtzman, and Wood. These were among the greatest comic book artists ever! My highest recommendation!"}, {"userName": "David James", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5039501-david-james", "userReview": "No one ever drew the laboratories of mad scientists like Jack Davis. Had he done nothing more, his standing in the pantheon of horror comics illustrators would be untouched. That he could make you wretch with the next panel when you saw what went on in those laboratories only adds to his mystique. The sickness his mind could conjure is on a level all its own. What I did not know until reading one of the essays in this book is that he wasn't enthusiastic about drawing this stuff. Apparently he worried about the kids who would read it. This never stopped him from going nuts however. The art here is laugh out loud nauseating.Classic stuff from the golden age of EC Comics. Still unmatched more than half a century later.

Yes, please!While the stories are uneven, they always give Davis's art a fine showcase, whether being dark and brooding, or playfully sinister (which invokes fond memories of his MAD Magazine work). The artwork does as much for the storytelling and the occasionally over-stuffed word boxes do.A lot of fun for any horror fan!"}, {"userName": "V\u00edctor Segovia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7311256-v-ctor-segovia", "userReview": "Un excelente trabajo de recopilaci\u00f3n de la grotesca obra del artista Jack Davis para una publicaci\u00f3n de terror, the crypt of terror, mucho antes del mentado c\u00f3digo de comic y la censura que trajo.Es una obra que muestra como s\u00e9 hac\u00eda terror en el formato de antolog\u00eda en loa d\u00edas finales de la era de oro del comic estadounidense"}, {"userName": "Ramey Moore", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250989-ramey-moore", "userReview": "The stories in this collection by comics legend Jack Davis are among the most essential stories for any fan of EC comics or horror stories more generally.

It\u2019s the Humanity,\u201d an evil-butcher horror story that ends pretty much like you\u2019d expect any evil-butcher horror story to end. Presenting the classic EC material in reader-friendly, artist-and-genre-centric packages for the first time, \u2019Taint the Meat collects every one of Davis\u2019s 24 Crypt stories in one convenient, gore-drenched package. Mostly written by EC editor Al Feldstein, these stories run the gamut from pure supernatural horror (the werewolf story \u201cUpon Reflection\u201d and the vampire story \u201cFare Tonight, Followed by Increasing Clottyness\u2026\u201d) to science gone horribly wrong (\u201cBats in My Belfry!\u201d), as well as the classic \u201cdisbeliever gets his comeuppance\u201d story (\u201cGrounds\u2026 For Horror!\u201d) to EC\u2019s bread and butter, the ridiculously grisly revenge-of-the-abused tale (\u201cThe Trophy!\u201d and \u201cWell-Cooked Hams!\u201d)\u2026 seasoned with buckets of blood and some of the most godawful punning titles ever committed to newsprint. Tales From the Crypt was the inspiration for the no-holds-barred pop-culture horror revolution of the 1970s and later, be it Stephen King, Tobe (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) Hooper, zombiemeister George A. Romero, or the current generation of extreme-horror practitioners like Eli (Hostel) Roth. Yet try as they may, no one has been able to capture the combination of technical virtuosity, tongue-in-cheek grisliness, and sheer naughty desire to provoke and appall that these classics managed to pull off again and again. \u2019Taint the Meat\u2026 will also include extensive story notes by EC experts from around the world.", "title": "'Tain't the Meat...It's the Humanity! and Other Stories\n      \n          (The EC Comics Library)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14475427-tain-t-the-meat-it-s-the-humanity-and-other-stories", "average": 4.24, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390511288l/14475427.jpg", "reviews": 18, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13711403.Jack_Davis", "name": "Jack  Davis"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4721184.Al_Feldstein", "name": "Al Feldstein"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30809.Gary_Groth", "name": "Gary Groth"}], "type": ["Sequential Art", "Horror", "Sequential Art", "Fiction", "Short Stories"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14475427-tain-t-the-meat-it-s-the-humanity-and-other-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/877725.The_Mad_Archives_Vol_1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11129123-jack-davis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26200288-taint-the-meat-it-s-the-humanity-and-other-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26889703-the-living-mummy-and-other-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27178119-the-ec-archives"]}
