She survived plenty of atrocities, including slavery, witnessing people's murders, and holding her son as he died in her arms. This is her testimony in book form and apparently, in Ye Olde Puritan Tymes it sold like hotcakes, because even 350 years ago, nothing sold readers on a book quite like kidnapping and torture: hence, the American captivity narrative (ah, our great American enduring racist legacies!). I dunno, what do I say about this? It's difficult to read and even more difficult to review. Mary prays her way through hell and back, just like any dutiful Puritan woman would, but despite all of that, I still finished the book thinking that she was kind of an annoying asshole."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3478956-steven", "userReview": "The Lancaster slaughter which opens the narrative horrifies me still, as it was intended. But there's only so many times you can say, \"knocked in the head,\" without unlidding your reader's laughbox. I tried not to smile, I really did. Alas...The \"removes\" Rowlandson uses to mark the episodes of her journey signify more than wanderlust or nomadic jimmy leg. Each clash and execution, each day without food or drink, each hour away from the comfortable naivety in which Rowlandson, until her captivity, had existed disturbs the fragile balance of her white, Protestant worldview and her own intuitive empathy. Perhaps the strongest tension throughout Rowlandson's narrative bestrides the momentary tenderness she feels toward those Indians who help her (acts of \"human\" benevolence opposed to the inferior image of the Indian she so desperately needs to believe in order for her world to make sense) and the escalation of her own zealotry the further removed she becomes (a defensive response to her own doubts about what she thinks she knows regarding these strong and proud Others).Yes, we could talk ad infinitum about this narrative's revelation of the colonizer mind. But we remove ourselves from the HEART of the matter by politically contextualizing the hell out of what, essentially, is an internal catastrophe. Rowlandson's encounter with the \"savage\" reveals something far more savage within herself. So savage, in fact, that she cannot face it and removes herself from the empathetic realm altogether. Rowlandson hovers above this text, detached from herself, no longer human. She becomes, rather, an endless series of biblical verses--the opposite, in some ways, of the dusty, carpenter Christ she supplicates. Jesus, after all, rejected the testament of removal and suffered unto death for the sake of empathy."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4113059-patricia", "userReview": "This short historical narrative was an interesting read, both historically and spiritually. Mary Rowlandson was captured by Indians in the 1600's and held captive for eleven weeks until she was ransomed. Stripped of all comforts, and losing sight of all human help, she was able to endure her captivity only through her strong faith in God. Instead of dwelling on the hardships she faced daily, she continually traced the goodness of God in keeping her safe from even further harm. \"Yet I see, when God calls a person to anything, and through never so many difficulties, yet He is fully able to carry them through and make them see, and say they have been gainers thereby. And I hope I can say in some measure, as David did, 'It is good for me that I have been afflicted.'\"\"Now the heathen begins to think all is their own, and the poor Christians' hopes to fail (as to man) and now their eyes are more to God, and their hearts sigh heaven-ward; and say in good earnest, 'Help Lord, or we perish.'

But there's lots of hilarious moments that are all like: THERE'S NO WAY THE INDIANS COULD SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN THIS MUST BE YOUR WILL GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH and then the best part is when she talks about stealing a piece of meat from a fellow captive, a little English KID, and she doesn't even try to justify it.

This book is the record of Mary Rowlandson's capture and captivity by some Native Americans in the year 1676. Her husband, three children and several friends and relatives from her town were also taken, though they were all separated and she only saw some of the others from time to time.She records the daily circumstances of her captivity in a very frank manner and describes how her faith in the Lord helped her to bear up under her afflictions. Her captors were a rather interesting people. Some of them were very nice and kind to her, and others were horribly cruel. I thought it was interesting that though some of them mistreated her terribly, she makes it clear that \"yet not one of them ever offered me the least abuse of unchastity to me, in word or action.\" Rowlandson ends her record by saying, \"Before I knew what affliction meant, I was ready sometimes to wish for it...For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth...but now I see the Lord had his time to scourge and chasten me.\"On a side note, I think it is important to read historical memoirs such as this in the context of the time in which it was written.

I remember really liking it then, and that hasn't changed. Rowlandson's narrative, however much of it is hers, is incredibly flat; she uses the same even tone to describe the murder of her children and the process of broiling broth. I'm really interested in hunger through the book, both Rowlandson's own and the way native people are consistently figured as ravenous and gaping.

Of the 37 in her household, 24 were captured and 12 killed, with only one escaping.The opening scene is very dramatic and graphic -- barbaric, chaotic, and hellish. Throughout the account various epithets are used to describe the Indians: hell-hounds, ravenous beasts, barbarous creatures, murderous wretches, merciless heathen, and wolves. Some people may object to this as offensive and even racist, but I believe it is ignorant of readers to say this is a racist account. The writer is describing her personal feelings and actual experiences while watching a horrific scene take place before her eyes. She then spends about three months with the Indians, genuinely in fear for her life, doing what she can to survive, and wondering if she will ever be restored to her family and people, before being returned. During that time, Rowlandson makes a distinction between the savage, cruel Indians and those who extended kindness and generosity to her. She makes it clear that during this time, no one ever offended or violated her.Rowlandson considers the possibility that the Indians were being used by God as a \"scourge\" to discipline His people. Rowlandson's narrative is often cited as an example of a jeremiad - a form usually associated with second generation Puritan sermons but which is also relevant to many other kinds of Puritan writing. Drawing from the Old Testament books of Jeremiah and Isaiah, jeremiads lament the spiritual and moral decline of a community and interpret recent misfortunes as God's just punishment for that decline. But at the same time that jeremiads bemoan their communities' fall from grace, they also read the misfortunes and punishments that result from that fall as paradoxical proofs of God's love and of the group's status as his \"chosen people.\" According to jeremidic logic, God would not bother chastising or testing people he did not view as special or important to his divine plan. Rowlandson believed that God uses suffering to teach His children certain lessons and to strengthen their trust and faith in Him.According to the author of the Preface (probably Increase Mather), Rowlandson's purpose for publishing the account was to testify to God's providence and preservation of her through her trial, and as a \"memorandum of God's dealing with her.\" As a Puritan, she viewed every aspect and incident in life as coming from the hand of God for His purpose, and she trusted Him with the outcome, whatever might happen. Throughout the narrative she quotes scripture to remind herself of God's protective care and purposes. While reading through the narrative, pay attention to: 1) Rowlandson\u2019s view of God and his dealing with his children; 2) Her descriptions and epithets used for the Indians, and changing attitude towards them; and 3) Her many references to scripture, and how she compares her life and circumstances to biblical passages, drawing on scripture for comfort, understanding, and hope."}, {"userName": "John Pistelli", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833943-john-pistelli", "userReview": "I think I am on my fourth or fifth reading of this short book, and they have all been in an academic context, either as student of the text or teacher of it, and always, for that matter, from the Norton Anthology. Rowlandson's narrative stands up to that many readings. Her style is lively, even verging on the epic, as at the in medias res beginning. She has a very observant eye, on the one hand, but also a powerfully allegorizing imagination; these often conflict with each other, which is the chief interest of the narrative in my view. Her account of her captivity among Native Americans during King Philip's War is both a story about reading and rereading the Bible so as to understand and justify her harrowing experience (including the murder of her child and her sister) in terms of God's rightful providence and also a story about that experience itself, shorn of higher meaning, expressed as a series of hard-to-interpret cultural encounters usually centered on food. As I told my students, this is a book about two things: reading and eating. Those two things occupy two distinct aesthetic planes: allegory and mimesis. Rowlandson the Bible-reader transforms experience into spiritual meaning so that her sufferings can be explained as the result of her religious failures while the \"demonic\" Indians become mere scourges of the Lord, instruments of His punitive will. Rowlandson the hungerer and eater keeps a humbly watchful and curious eye on how things work and how people act, even to the point of giving us recipes for Native American cooking. For her, no matter how hard she sometimes tries, food is not really a spiritual message but a physical necessity and even, eventually, a pleasure. In its tense demonstration of the Puritan problem\u2014how to value the individual above all and still attribute every action and meaning to God\u2014as a problem of cultural difference and enmity, Rowlandson's narrative reminds me of Robinson Crusoe. But she got there before Defoe and, according to recent scholarship, was not less influential than he was on the development of the English and American novel. She wrote the first story of female virtue imperiled and female power and capacity in the face of threat. This is an ambiguous legacy, of course, at once feminist and imperialist, but it is the legacy to which Pamela and Jane Eyre and even, by attenuation, Mrs. Dalloway are heir. However we may judge the politics of this narrative, then, we must credit its profound intelligence in charting so vividly the literary and religious and cultural crises at the heart of modernity. It deserves for that reason its relatively new eminence in the canon of American and even Anglophone literature."}, {"userName": "Haven Wright", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25280055-haven-wright", "userReview": "Mary Rowlandson, like many others of her time, viewed nature as a place of the devil. This is most likely because the way she understood the lifestyle of the Indians bled over into her views of the \"uncivilized\" environment they survived in. Once she is taken, she describes her exile from civilization as, \"I must turn my back upon the town, and travel with them into the vast and desolate wilderness... It is not my tongue, or pen that can express the sorrows of my heart, and bitterness of my spirit that I had at this departure.\" Her perspective of the wilderness is that of a barren place, which is probably how the Indians viewed the colonized land. After her baby passes away she states that, \"There I left that child in the wilderness, and must commit it, and myself also in this wilderness condition...\" Here she tells us that she not only wilderness viewed the wilderness as empty, but also a place of detachment. It is when she starts to realize starvation that her mind begins to change. Foods she would not eat before, like bear, would be appreciated and downed quickly. Once she has grown accustom to surviving the way the Indians did she started to gain an appreciation for the wilderness. After she has made it back to a colony of fellow Christians and had time to reflect on her time away, she states that, \"I can but stand in admiration to see the wonderful power of God in providing for such a vast number of our enemies in the wilderness...\" This is a drastically different view from her beliefs in the beginning where there wilderness was of the devil. Now she deemed it a place of God that was vast and full of provisions for those who took advantage of it. This is an excellent story of extensive character development in Early American Literature."}, {"userName": "Yasaman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman", "userReview": "This is a very important piece of American literature not necessarily because it's what the narrator intended, but because of how much is revealed of the Native American culture - unintentionally! We read Mrs. Rowlandson describing all these seemingly \"horrific\" deeds of the natives, but really, any amount of \"savagery\" involved was nothing more than what would typically be seen in any battle or invasion. We read about her not being fed anything but cold water. Was that because she and her child were offered nothing to eat? No, it was because what the natives did offer her - horse flesh - she didn't like. We read about her being given a Bible, being allowed to read, being PAID for what she does for the natives in food currency!

To know about the existence of a nation, we dig for its literary production. However, unfortunately for the Natives, they had no literature recording their culture, their roots, or their mere existence. We only hear about them through the writings of their enemy who all the time demonizes them.  As a reader, I tried my utmost to identify with the protagonist yet in vain. I found the narrator much closer to be an Israeli soldier telling a story about how he was captured while invading the Gaza strip or an Israeli settler narrating the suffering she might have during the war. However, not in any way I could find a similarity between me as a Palestinian and Mary, the narrator, who is actually part of a colonial project.  By the means of literature, Mary Rowlandson, like all the literary works of the colonial Americans, gives a one-sided image about the indigenous people. She all throughout the narration describes them as wretches, pagans, savages, inhuman heathens, and beasts. Such descriptions and nicks are seen as an attempt to justify the colonialists' massacres against the indigenous people. Hence, she tries to frame the reader by imposing her own subjective viewpoint about the Natives.  What if this same story is told by a Native American? At least we could have known the first beginning of the conflict which is totally embedded in the narration of Mary. Mary Rowlandson was not only promoting the colonial project in America but also promoting the superiority of her Christian religion over the other creeds of the Natives. She represents the Puritan way of thinking and gives her comrades an example of patience and endurance to be followed. Almost in every line, you could find the word \"God\" which makes the story abundant with religious and biblical sayings or examples. (I am not sure whether this denotes her strong belief in God or it was all made up to create a spiritual atmosphere of a true model of a Christian)."}, {"userName": "Jeff Ford", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15861831-jeff-ford", "userReview": "This short narrative, considered by some to be America's first best seller, is well worth reading. It does take some effort on part of the reader due to its age which makes its language and context so foreign today. One cannot fully appreciate Mary Rowlandson's ordeal without an effort to understand the circumstances leading to King Philip's War and the state of relations between the colonists and the native population at the time.This is at its core a story of Christian faith. Mrs. Rowlandson's captors and even her great loss are incidental to her religious message. Considering the brutality of the indian attack and the great loss Mrs. Rowlandson endured, her account is remarkably kind to her captors. Her treatment by her captors is as would be expected of a hostage - neither excessively harsh nor particularly kind. However, Mrs. Rowlandson does not reflect on either. Instead, she writes of the uncertainty of life and struggles make sense of her ordeal as God's will. Throughout she maintains her faith and hope.I have read that some believe the biblical references were later embellishments, perhaps added by Cotton Mather. I see no reason why this would be the case. Her piety is befitting of a wife of a Puritan minister. Removing these parts would take from Mrs. Rowlandson and her narrative the meaning she gained from her ordeal and thereby take away all those qualities which make the narrative so exceptional.\nFor whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
