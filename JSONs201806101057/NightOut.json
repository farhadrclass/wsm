An invitation? A decision.Premise/plot: A lonely boarding school student has a once-in-a-lifetime adventure leading to a fantastical story to relate to his classmates the next morning.My thoughts: How many times should you have to read a picture book to know if you liked it? I know two times wasn't enough to persuade me to like-like it. But I did like it more the second time than the first.The text is sparse to say the least. One is really \"reading\" the illustrations. The pictures do a good job of conveying the themes of this story: loneliness and a longing to belong. One of the first spreads shows the boy eating dinner all alone. This isolation continues through the evening. But by the next morning, things have started to shift--a new day with new opportunities has dawned for the boy. The difference? An adventure that only a dreamer could have.I wanted to like this one more than I did. I should like a book where the ADVENTURE ends up in a tea party. But it is such an odd gathering. I had trouble suspending my disbelief if I'm honest.Text: 3 out of 5Illustrations: 3 out of 5Total: 6 out of 10"}, {"userName": "M.

Night Out is essentially a wordless book held up by evocative, punchy sentence fragments (a style I must admit that I have something of a weakness for). This is a quite simple story about a boy\u2019s imagined nighttime sojourn and the impact it makes in his life.A natural comparison would be Miyakoshi\u2019s Tea Party in the Woods. Although that book has no mysterious party invitation nor the appeal of a rule-breaking after hours ride into the dark, it does a have a tea party peopled with animals in common. If the party was all that there was to this book, the random quality of Miyakoshi\u2019s and its sheer strangeness is easily more memorable. As pleasant as the actual \u2018night out\u2019 portion of Miyares\u2019 story is, the real power of it lies in the scenes that bookend the titular sequence. Our protagonist is first shown alone, separate, and shy. At the end of the book, he tells the story of his dream to his peers; he leverages his imagination to connect. In a way, the tea party of the night before is repeated with human companions. I almost wish that there was a bit more of a denouement, because the profundity of this final scene flies by before it can really sink in.Miyares has been illustrating consistently good books since his debut. I would love to see him get another award, although I don\u2019t know if this book will be the one. I do hope he returns to this \u2018almost wordless\u2019 territory in future projects. Night Out displays his ability to make something with imagination and heart. Personally, I cannot wait to see how he mixes them into his next book."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "Although I'm not entirely clear if the story takes place in an orphanage or a boarding school, what is clear is that one boy seems terribly lonely. The illustrations, created with gouache and colored pencils, show him sitting alone at the dinner table, far removed from the other boys, and then lying sleepless in his bed. When he sees an envelope with an invitation, he climbs out of bed and heads out into the night where he has quite an adventure and shares tea with some new animal friends. When morning comes, and he's back in his bed, he's ready to tell the other youngsters about his night out. It could well be that storytelling serves as his entr\u00e9e into some new friendships. Readers can interpret this night out as one he actually has or even one that he imagined while lying in that bed, unable to sleep. Either way, it gives him a new perspective on life and he's ready to embrace life's possibilities. I wonder how many of us would have been as eager as he is to head out into the dark for an unknown destination. The author has chosen to use words quite sparingly but to good effect here."}, {"userName": "Margie", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5281649-margie", "userReview": "As a human being there is nothing more heartbreaking than seeing a child alone when a group nearby is enjoying the company of each other. You see this more often than you would like as an educator. With gentle suggestions on your part a connection is possible between the group and the boy or girl without a friend.Wishing for a friend, reaching out to others, is not always easy but the results can be rewarding and last a lifetime. Night Out (Schwartz & Wade Books, May 8, 2018) written and illustrated by Daniel Miyares takes readers on a magical journey of discovery. Our dreams can change the course of our lives.My full recommendation: http://librariansquest.blogspot.com/2..."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/331426-lindsey", "userReview": "I had fun reading this picture book aloud with my three-year-old niece. While it is not a wordless picture book, the text is minimal, so she explained what was happening in the illustrations. We were both especially charmed by the giant turtle, and this is a small thing but I liked that the size of the animals at the tea party seemed to fluctuate. It added to the surrealism. On that note, I'm still not quite sure if this book follows a dream or a surreal adventure, but maybe that's the point - it's open to interpretation!"}, {"userName": "Jared White", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8258135-jared-white", "userReview": "A boy becomes more accepted because of his abilities as a storyteller. I think most groups of friends benefit from having a storyteller in the mix. Hmm, I'll choose to think that the boy had just started attending the boarding school and that's why he hasn't been accepted into the group. Not a favorite, but a nice little book."}, {"userName": "Niki Marion", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26191060-niki-marion", "userReview": "Reminds me of Akiko Miyakoshi's Tea Party in the Woods plus The Way Home in the Night, but a touch more upbeat.
