It was brief and mysterious and I liked the story that it was teasing. What a tease that it was, too! A few pages in and I knew that things were not going to go as planned. The first thing I noticed was what I thought was going to be a Young Adult read ended up feeling more like a Middle Grade one. It\u2019s not that I am against that age level of reading, just that I like to know it before I step in it. Once I adjusted my reading perception to match the level, things picked up a little and I was able to coast for a while before slamming into the end. I completely understood what message it was supposed to convey but the execution of it left much to be desired."}, {"userName": "Pat Cummings", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31580463-pat-cummings", "userReview": "The concept for \nThe Home\n was promising enough that I nominated it for publishing on Kindle Scout: hundreds of children are tended in a single building by their \"Father,\" who either kidnapped them or coaxed them off the streets as runaways. These children don't work like Fagin's crew, nor do they go to school. They seem to spend their time playing video games and earning tokens by doing chores or by gambling. The carny atmosphere doesn't disguise the fact that none of them are allowed to leave. Think of boys-becoming-donkeys on Pleasure Island in Pinocchio, and you've got the vibe.The tale is told by two voices: Bom and Mystic are older children in the Home. Bom is a natural leader, a young man in age, who is being groomed as a sort of deputy-Father. Mystic is a new addition to the ranks\u2014who incidentally, also fills the author's need of a foil for explanations. (In '50s pulp science fiction, for example, this role was filled by a buxom blonde lab assistant.)In the only subtle concept of the novel, the Home itself becomes a representation of many inner-city societies, with a \"welfare class\" trapped in sterile leisure by a benign but strict provider, and an upwardly-mobile (or \"outwardly-mobile\") group seeking a way to live on their own terms. By contrast to Meritropolis, another novel with similar themes that I happened to read at the same time, this novel was dismayingly simplistic and badly proof-read, with an annoying number of grammatical and typographical errors. The most distressing \"typo\" left me looking for an escape with the same fervor as Bom and Mystic. The word is in quotes because its near-universal occurrence indicates it was a writer's or proofer's error of knowledge rather than a mistake in typesetting: the omission of commas before every name used as a directed address in dialog. It was never \"I was looking for that, Bom...\" but Watch out! Duck!:\"I was looking for that Bom...\"About halfway through, I stopped noting error corrections in my Kindle, especially as a frequent use of the wrong homophones made me suspect this was a novel written using speech software. Mispronounced words or sloppy pronunciations might have yielded some of the more amusing choices: \"crown\" for \"crayon\" for example.Since I understand such systems ask the speaker to select among homophones like \"you're\" and \"your\" or \"rain\" and \"reign,\" there was an opportunity to correct it. It is more likely someone simply accepted the most-frequent default without looking at the options. Either way, in writing \nThe Home\n using speech software, the author made another wrong choice."}, {"userName": "Melissa Levine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4264833-melissa-levine", "userReview": "I did the audiobook version of this story. Sorry, but I didn\u2019t like it at all. I\u2019m not sure who this story was geared to but I imagine it was for young kids. I hate giving bad reviews, what more can I say?Questions/Comments:There\u2019s the part after Bom gives him little speech, which gets \u2018Father\u2019 mad at him. There\u2019s supposed to be guards out looking for him. When Mystic goes to Bom\u2019s room why didn\u2019t the guards question her? Or even better, why does Bom have guards to begin with?Lack of detail. I found it strange that the author went into detail when Mystic was going through Bom\u2019s room but everything else was left pretty vague. For example, the marketplace, what does it look like? We know there\u2019s a marketplace, a theater, bedrooms, a communal bathroom, an auditorium, etc., and it\u2019s in what? An old office building? Because of this lack of detail, I had a hard time caring about the characters in the story. I never felt connected or really focused on the story, of course, the narrator didn\u2019t help in this area.So, Tom aka \u2018Father\u2019 saw Bom helping the little boy at the marketplace when he was freaking out about the high-priced crackers, YET, didn\u2019t know Bom had given food to the market guy? How was Bom able to get so much food and all for the kids he helped get out and the market without \u2018Father\u2019 noticing?I would suggest to the author that he go with contractions next time. Because of the lack of contractions, at least based on the audiobook version, makes the story very stilted.At the end, where had Joshua gotten money to live with? Mystic had been a student when she got her first job, but as an adult needs a HS diploma. So, why hadn\u2019t she continued her education to get a GED? That part doesn\u2019t really make sense."}, {"userName": "Rachel Sakitis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51247073-rachel-sakitis", "userReview": "I received this book free from Goodreads.
