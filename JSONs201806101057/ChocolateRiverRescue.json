The story deals with the adventures of Tony, Craig, Shawn and Petra as they try to escape from an ice floe that is being dragged out to the open sea by the fierce tidal current of the Peticodiack River. The book is based on a true story and is a real page-turner. From the first chapter onwards the reader will find themselves caught up in a breathless adventure that begs to be read at a single go.yours in storytelling,Steve Vernon"}, {"userName": "Darlene Williams", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6964957-darlene-williams", "userReview": "This was a fabulous read-aloud to grade four students :)"}, {"userName": "Mrs. Ruigrok", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3638626-mrs-ruigrok", "userReview": "A fantastic book....the students were on the edge of their seats listening and wondering what was going to happen next. Fantastic descriptive writing, made us feel like we were there, living this adventure as well.

This book should have had much more thought to it. In my opinion i think this book should have been longer."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3419031-christina", "userReview": "amazing story and how it can actually happen to anyone"}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11984253-pat", "userReview": "I used this book in a classroom setting.

They are quickly spotted by a passerby, who calls 911 and sets the police and fire departments in motion. What ensues is a complicated and dangerous rescue mission. The water is moving fast, and it will be terribly difficult to intercept the boys at the right point on the river.
