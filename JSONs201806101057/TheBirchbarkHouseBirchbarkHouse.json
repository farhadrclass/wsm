Because it\u2019s one of the books chosen as a group read for this book, and because I know a couple of people who love this book, I decided to again try to read it. I\u2019m so grateful that I took this new opportunity.I have such a difficult time with this author\u2019s writing style. Many readers love it, but I struggle with it. The descriptions of how all the animals are used are so vivid, and repulsive to me, even as at the same time I can appreciate these people\u2019s way of life. I did like this book enough to finish it on this (my second) attempt. And, I\u2019m so glad I did because, for me, it went from a 2 star to 3 star to 4 star to almost 5 star book. I loved the ending and was tempted to give this book 5 stars, but given my early struggles, I can\u2019t quite do that.I love the beautiful name Omakayas, and I did love saying it out loud. I very much appreciated that it was a real name taken from a census. At the end of the book, I really appreciate the glossary with pronunciation of Ojibwa words and the author\u2019s note about that language being an oral, not a written, language. Although, when the words are used in the book proper, the English translation is generally used alongside them, so as the reader reads, it\u2019s easy to figure out what they mean. As I always do, I enjoyed the map on the inside covers of the book.The sibling rivalry seems spot on, as does the sibling love. I love Andeg the crow. I love the all the birds, bears, and even the dogs.There is some sadness, with wonderful descriptions of grief and depression. I nearly cried two times, once with a loss that was not a death, and once with the reveal toward the end and going to the end of the book.It\u2019s enjoyable to read of a time and culture where the children are full contributors to their community; they do the work adults do, and when they\u2019re old enough to do certain tasks they do them. There is no artificial separation between the generations, other than the younger people being required to follow the directions of the older people and the young people engaging in some play.I ended up loving this book because the characters, human and non-human, are so memorable and the description of the way these people live is so vivid, and so fascinating.

It's the story of Omakayas, an Ojibwe girl growing up in the mid-1800s. The book is loosely plotted and takes you through a year in her life. I especially liked the bits that explain how Omakayas's community does things like make their houses, create their food cache, etc. In that way, it's very like Little House on the Prairie and kids who are interested in How They Did Things Way Back Then will eat this up for sure. The story has more emotion to it than what I remember from Little House. When smallpox comes to their village, there are some harrowing moments as Omakayas struggles to care for her family. Push this into the hands of all the Little House on the Prairie fans you know.

The explorations of the Ojibwa culture were interesting and absorbing. The smallpox was so hard to read about. (Is that a spoiler? Maybe.) The nearness to the bone of their lives cheek by jowl with their insistence that the soul of the people is made of laughter was incredibly poignant. More than once I thought, 'yeah, well, take THAT, Laura Ingalls' but no doubt that's only mean-spiritedness on my part. I did love Laura, but I think I'd rather have had Omakayas to grow up with.I found an Ojibwa word in this book that I love with all my heart: manidominenz (mah-nih-DOH-min-eynz), which means tiny beads- but literally means \"little spirit seeds\". If I ever open a bead store, that's the name of it.The illustrations were the weakest link, I thought.

Omakayas is a seven-year-old Ojibwa girl living in Michigan. She is the sole survivor of a small pox epidemic when she\u2019s taken into another family as an infant. Tallow is a strong matriarch and Omakayas (also called Little Frog), thrives in the community on Lake Superior\u2019s Madeline Island, also known as the Island of the Golden-Breasted Woodpecker. The book follows Omakayas, her family and the tribe through four seasons of 1847. I was fascinated by this story of the life of the Native Americans during this time period. I learned about the hard work of tanning hides, the craft of decorating special garments with intricate beadwork, the cycles of hunting and gathering, and the dangers (and joys) of living so close to nature. Omakayas is a wonderful narrator \u2013 inquisitive, observant, intelligent, and compassionate. She\u2019s also a typical seven year old \u2013 sometimes a little naughty, and not always understanding the reasons why she is asked to perform certain tasks, or forbidden from other adventures. I can see why this is sometimes taught in social studies classes for middle-grade students. Erdrich is a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwa, and she spoke to various Ojibwa elders about the significance of Madeline Island. Events depicted are historically accurate (including a documented small pox epidemic). The text version includes Erdrich\u2019s pencil drawing illustrations. Nicolle Littrell does a fine job performing the audio version. She has good pacing and the book is clearly understandable for even younger readers."}, {"userName": "Jessika", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166992-jessika", "userReview": "So, not only can Louise Erdrich write excellent adult fiction, but she is also a master at children's stories. This book would be a perfect way for young readers to branch out and explore different cultures, as well as different time periods. The book focuses mainly on Omakayas (Oh-MAH-kay-as) and her life and the customs of an Oijbwa tribe. I loved Omakayas--she was such a great protagonist. She's smart beyond her years, but she's also just a normal kid, and that makes her relatable to her readers. She thinks her younger brother is a pain, she's jealous of her older sister, and she wants to avoid chores. I was completely caught up in the descriptions of the Ojibwa way of life, and Erdrich wrote effortlessly without being overdetailed or boring. Native Americans rely strongly on their oral storytelling, and that was reflected in this book. Even though I was reading written words, I could hear them being read aloud, and I feel like this would be the perfect book to read huddled around a campfire. Erdrich has a talent with characters, and I could picture each of them perfectly. They had such distinct personalities, and I know that I, for one, want to read more about this family. She sets this one up perfectly for a sequel because it isn't towards the end of the book until Omakayas really discovers her calling in life and actually gets to act upon it. She also has a talent for writing emotions. There were times when my heart leapt, and there was one particular talent that tugged at my heartstrings and left me feeling so sad and desolate that I had to read on in the hopes that something happy would happen again soon. Another thing that I give Erdrich HUGE props for is her use of the Ojibwa vocabulary. There is a glossary in the back of the book, but I found myself using it more for pronunciation purposed than for definitions. Erdrich makes sure that the vocabulary is clearly defined, either by outright stating what it means or by using enough context to make it clear. Really, I didn't even need the glossary for the pronunciation because being that the Ojibwa language was meant to be spoken, not written, the words are spelled phonetically. A small thing that I loved were the illustrations by Erdrich throughout the story. Simple, but strikingly beautiful at the same time. I love stuff like that--it's like little autographs from the author but better! Overall, I loved so much about this book, I can't get over it! I can't wait to read the next one of Omakayas' story and I can't wait to go out and get my own copy of this!"}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1392534-catherine", "userReview": "This is a gorgeous book - a year in the life of Omakayas, a young Ojibwe girl who lives at the edge of Lake Superior in 1847. The book weaves together a dozen different strands of narrative - Omakayas' family responsibilities and affections; her work as young woman; the subsistence patterns of her community; the effect of trade and sickness on the Ojibwe; the potential for treaties and removal by the Americans; the world of medicine, and of spirits; the presence of missionaries and their schooling; the reality of loss and the transformative effect of healing. Omakayas' life is rooted in her Ojibwe heritage, and there's enormous value in seeing that no matter the presence of traders, missionaries, priests, soldiers and settlers, her life is still oriented by the knowledge and values her community have passed down for generations - and that they have use for the things non-Indians bring into their midst, for often quite different reasons than non-whites would plan.The Birchbark House is a children's book - or perhaps a young, young adult's - but it is captivating and beautifully written. I learned a lot, and gained an enormous amount from stepping into the emotional life of Omakayas and her family, rather than simple reading non-fiction accounts of this time and place in secondary sources."}, {"userName": "Elliott  Austin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56551866-elliott-austin", "userReview": "**7.0/10**"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5013497-mark", "userReview": "Omakayas, is a seven year old Ojibwa girl and we follow her and her adopted family for four seasons in 1847 and this includes a smallpox outbreak, which decimated the tribe.

Since the story is set on an island in Lake Superior in 1847 and mostly consists of a detailed account of the traditional Ojibwa life, it serves as a counter narrative to Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series.However, I wish I liked The Birchbark House more. The first two-thirds of the story were slow-paced and rather dull, and Louise Erdrich\u2019s writing seemed a little bit too childish.

After reading the first two Wilder novels with my 5 year old, it was obvious that Native American experiences were underrepresented. To my chagrin, my son was even a little scared of the Indians in those books. Erdrich's first novel for young people, written in the early 21st century, parallels Wilder's stories in many ways. Just as with Wilder, Erdrich provides historical information on survival and family dynamics, but it still has all the misadventures and misunderstandings. A few of the scenes, such as the father's storytelling episode, and many of the characters perfectly mirror Wilder. And like our unsinkable Laura Ingalls, Omakayas is a worthy addition to young heroines of children's literature.This is a second reading for me (the first many moons ago), and I enjoyed the prose a lot more than I remember. The book gives a fascinating look into a more matriarchal society at work, as most of the book men are away hunting and bartering, and Jude and I learned a lot about the Ojibwe way of life in way not filtered through a white protagonist. But what I most appreciate about The Birchbark House is the elevated final fifth of the book, where Erdrich uses her sophisticated storytelling powers to raise the complexity of Omakayas and her family. There is tragedy and realization, honesty and reflection.It appears that Erdrich has written several more books in Omakayas' ongoing journey, much in the same vein of Wilder. I would be interested in personally checking them out, not even for future read alouds, but out of my own curiosity. I would urge all parents to consider sharing this book with their young ones, especially if they have loved, or plan to share, Wilder's novels\u2014which by all means you should."}, {"userName": "Amanda H", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4316284-amanda-h", "userReview": "Immediately the first paragraph catches your attention and you expect the story to be full of adventure and interesting. It is not the case until about half-way through. The begining is extremely slow with the background information. It explains how the Objiwa tribe that \"Little Frog\" is part of prepares their Birchbark house for the Spring and the activities that happen during the spring time. Everything keeps hinting at this great \"dream\" that \"Little Frog\" is supposed to get but nothing really happens. The only thing interesting is when she goes into the forest and is playing with bear cubs.  Around the middle is when things get interesting but extremely sad. Her whole family (except \"Little Frog\" and her grandmother) gets Smallpox from the white men. Her grandmother becomes too weak to take care of everyone by herself so \"Little Frog\" starts to help. Unfortunately then her favorite little brother dies and her older sister's extremely good friend dies. \"Little Frog\" is left in shock for almost the rest of the book. \"The Birchbark House\" writing style is more geared towards younger children but the content is anything but for younger children. The begining would make most older children put the book down after about the first chapter. Younger children would probably love it but once the family gets smallpox the content is too strong for most young children to handle.

Knowing sickness has claimed the lives of everyone on the island except this little girl, the men get back into their canoes and leave, afraid and sure the baby will soon die of the same sickness as her family. One of the men decides to tells his wife about the baby, sure that this brave, fearless woman named Old Tallow would rescue the baby.The baby is rescued and brought to an Anishinabe or Ojibwe family to be raised on another Lake Superior island they call Island of the Golden Breasted Woodpecker, in a village called LaPointe. The baby was named Omakayas, or Little Frog because her first step a hop, and she lives with her new family her DeyDey, her Mama Yellow Kettle, Nokomis (grandma), beautiful older sister Angeline, greedy and annoying younger brother Pinch and baby brother Neewo. Omakayas is unaware of what happened to her as a baby, but knows that Old Tallow had a special affection for her. Now in the Summer of 1947, Omakayas begins to slowly and in great detail narrate the life of her family and other Ojibwe over a period of four seasons. There is a lot of work to be done during each season, most of it in preparation for surviving the winter when food is scare and the cold is bitter. There are hides to be scrapes and tanned, new makazins to be made, food to be planted, harvested, dried and stored in the cold earth, fish to be caught and dried, and wood to be chopped and stacked. But even though there is a lot of work, there is a lot of fun to be had, socializing to be done and pleasure in nature, in Nokomis's storytelling and celebrations with other Ojibwe to be had.Into the hard, but contented life, comes talk of the chimookoman or white people wanted to push further west and the possibility that the Ojibwe will have to be moved. But before that happens, a sick visitor, a fur trader, arrives at the traditional dance the Ojibwe have in the late fall and dies of smallpox. In no time, the disease spreads to Ojibwe family in LaPointe, including Omakaysas's family. Everyone except Omakaysas is affected. When Old Tallow tells Omakayas the story her survival, it becomes clear that the year that has just passed was a year of growth and maturity for the young girl, one that leads a path to the possibility that she could eventually become a healer among the Ojibwe.The Birchbark House has to be one of the most beautifully written, lyrical books I've ever read. Louise Erdrich has a way with words that is just mesmerizing, and yet so straightforward and simple. I often felt as if I were there, listening to a story told by Nokomis on a cold winter's night even though I actually read it on a warm June night. Overall, The Birchbark House is a very descriptive book, thanks to Omakayas and her observations. Through them, the reader is introduced to Ojibwe culture, tradition and language. It is amazing to read of closely connected to nature Native Americans were, in particular how they lived with, used and totally respected the world around them. When an animal is killed for food, it's like is never taken for granted. Erdrich has sprinkled Ojibwe words throughout the novel, and there is a very useful glossary at the end of the book, with pronunciation help.Omakayas is a wonderfully enchanting protagonist. She seems to understand so much at such a young age. But she isn't without spunk and daring. Not unlike most kids, she envies Angeleine's beauty, can't stand brother Pinch, loves Neewo and likes to pretend he is her baby, complains about chores she doesn't like, is devoted to her rescued crow Andeg, loves a good story, and feels totally at home in the natural world. The Birchbark House is part of a series consisting of four novels. In August, a fifth novel, Makoons, will be added to this wonderful series written from an authentic Native American perspective. I can't wait to read and reread all of the Birchbark House series this summer, and can't recommend them highly enough.A printable teaching guide that includes discussion questions, activities and projects is available for the first three books in the Birchbark House series HEREThis book is recommended for readers age 8+This book was purchased for my personal libraryFYI: Erdrich has claimed that the smallpox epidemic she writes about in this novel did indeed happen in 1847, although some readers have expressed skepticism about it. I did find a creditable reference to it in Holding Our World Together: Ojibwe Women and the Survival of Community by Brenda J. Child, published in 2012 by Penguin. Child writes that a fur trader named Lyman Warren died of smallpox on Madeline Island, spreading the disease that ultimately killed 18 Ojibwe there.This review was originally posted on Randomly Reading"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy", "userReview": "After the message of pioneers fearing native Americans in Little House on the Prairie, I decided we needed to listen to a book told from the other side of the story. The author's father is German American and mother is half Ojibwe and half French American, so she grew up experiencing and hearing about her native American heritage. The Birchbark House is a fictional work which takes place slightly earlier in American history than the Little House series when native Americans were still largely able to maintain a life in keeping with their tribe's traditions before large-scale intrusion by European settlers but right on the cusp of it. The native Americans have guns and are invited to send their children to school to learn to read, but their day-to-day life is still very similar to those of their ancestors. Still, they depend on nature around them for their daily survival. Their homes are made of birch bark, they hunt and gather for food, etc. The story starts out with a smallpox epidemic in 1847 near Lake Superior where only one baby survives. It then diverges from that tale to follow the life of a 7-year-old Ojibwa girl named Omakayas. It follows her life through 4 seasons of the year. The story doesn't feel like it's driving toward any specific end, but it's pleasant. We see her love for her family and her affinity toward the animals around her. She tames a black bird as a pet and has conversations with bears. Life is sometimes hard and sometimes sad, but there's plenty of good to bring a smile to her face. I don't have any intention of continuing this series, but it was nice to dip my toes into it for a while. My 6-year-old enjoyed it and begged to listen to it daily. She kept hoping that we'd meet the baby bears again, and was not disappointed.

It focuses on the Ojibwe tribe, located on an island in Lake Superior. It gives the reader a very clear picture of day-to-day life in the tribe, with the center of the story being one family in particular. As it is written for adolescent readers, or even a little younger, it describes their life through the eyes of an 8 year old girl and the author captures her innocence authentically. At times in the first half of the book I found it to be a little bit dull. ALthough I was getting a good grasp of the Ojibwe way of life, there didn't seem to be much plot. Then a tragedy strikes the family very abruptly and I was completely taken aback. The rest of the story comes full circle very successfully and I ended up liking the book much more than I thought I would. My students are reading this now and they seem to be getting a lot out of it, many have finished it already. At 12 years old, they are the target audience so that is fortunate.

I can see why it gets compared to Wilder's Little House series. The writing style is even similar and main character's voice is pretty similar as well. After that, it diverges quite a bit. I wonder if Erdrich chose to focus on a middle character and that writing style to sort of mirror Little House?Overall though, this is a series you don't have to feel a bit culturally insensitive for reading. As a child, I read Little House and thought that the native references were a bit unkind, but, as an adult it's just awkward reading some of that. I work in a library and very occasionally recommend the Little House series, but, with a couple caveats. Who do I recommend this book to? Anyone who liked Wilder's series as a child but finds it awkward to read now. Anyone who would like their child to read a similar series with adventure and heartbreak and history without the uncomfortable bits in Wilder. Now, this book is heartbreaking right from the beginning. Though, the heartbreak that happens in the beginning is to characters you don't know yet, so it may be fine for kids. There are a couple more character deaths that are a bit more intense for young readers. If you are worried about how your kid will react, maybe read the book first to judge for yourself. It's the kind of book I would have been fine reading around age 9 or 10. However, by that point I had already had my heart destroyed by books like \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" and movies like \"Old Yeller\" and \"Bambi\". If your kid hasn't dealt with death in books yet then they may not be quite ready for this one yet. Overall, highly recommend. It is definitely a middle grade sort of book, so you don't get quite the same depth that you get in an adult novel, but for middle grade this is a very solid read."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38560685-ellie", "userReview": "What a lovely book!

Omakayas is trapped between wanting to be older, so she can learn new skills such as beading, and wanting to be younger, so she doesn\u2019t have to help tan furs. The family faces dangers and tragedies along the way and Omakayas discovers what her life\u2019s calling is, to be a healer.  Several sources describe this book as the Native American version of Little House on the Prairie. I liked that description. I used Little House to teach my student how early pioneers built houses, got water, found provisions, and grew and hunted their food. In much the same way, the The Birchbark House does the same for the Ojibwa. We learn how they survive on their Island of the Golden-Breasted Woodpecker. Even the book format, the single image on each chapter page, the illustrations, the way characters tell stories while everyone is gathered around, is very similar.  I think that the strength of this book is the protagonist Omakayas. She is a child one minute and as brave and level headed as an adult the next. She makes the reader want to know her better. Her unique gift with animals and the way she interacts with others is very believable. One weakness of the book, is the early chapters. Erdrich puts a great deal of effort into her detailed description. However, this makes for a very slow beginning. I also don\u2019t like having to flip to the glossary in the back of the book for the Ojibwa translations. I would prefer to see them on the pages. The author also points out that Ojibwa is a spoken language and so there are many translations. She apologizes for any errors in translation. This book is very appropriate for grades 3-5. It can easily be incorporated into units on Native Americans, American history, or early settlers, or survival. It would also be a good book an art class. Students could read some of the detailed descriptions and create an illustration from it. It could also be used as a read aloud, when dealing with the issue of death. It is also a different look at adoption and who is family.2006 American Indian Youth Literature Award Winners"}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/453709-kristen", "userReview": "This book follows a year in the life of Omakayas, a 7-year-old Ojibwe girl living in about 1847 on what is now known as Madeline Island in Wisconsin. Omakayas is a pleasure of a character, and I particularly loved seeing her rich and varied sibling relationships unfurl: beautiful and haughty big sister Angeline, tedious and naughty little brother Pinch, and beloved baby Neewo. I adored the Little House books as a child for the window they provided into a long-ago time, but re-reading them as an adult was struck by how much racism I hadn't remembered--or had never picked up on the first time. The Birchbark House (the first in a series that now has five books, possibly with more to come) had a similar sort of cozy feeling as I saw Omakayas and her family farm, hunt, play, and live in a way that is both ordinary to them and so utterly unlike anything I have experienced. Also somewhat similar to the Little House books, author Louise Erdrich has based this series loosely on her own family history; her affection and respect for these characters is palpable.This book doesn't directly confront the settler narratives common in children's literature from the 19th century. White people rarely interact with the book's characters (although they do moreso in later books in the series), and racist language or misinformation don't figure into the story. The same aspects that make this such a cozy read also implicitly go a long way to disproving the baggage readers might bring to the story about native cultures being \"primitive,\" western lands being \"free\" for \"settling,\" etc.I would read this with my kids, probably about first or second grade and up. There are some emotional discussions of loss following exposure to smallpox (including in the first chapter), and if you read further into the series, you'll encounter themes of displacement and cultural violence. It's age appropriate and certainly historically accurate, but I would want to be able to observe how those things are landing with my kids and to provide further context and opportunities to talk through those elements."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64554083-jennifer-peterson", "userReview": "Erdrich, Louise.

This is not so much a plot driven novel, or even a character driven novel really, but a setting driven story if that makes sense. It tells of this family's life in a year's span of time, while showing how Omakayas and her family's culture was so connected to nature and animals. I definitely learned a lot. The ending was so sweet! Also, our protagonist was smart and determined, which was great to see in a 7 year old girl. We get to see her go through a few transformations as she grows, which was great to see.

When she was a baby, she was the lone survivor of a smallpox outbreak that killed everyone in her village. She then was placed with a foster family though she has no idea that she is not related to them by blood. This story proceeds to tell about Omakayas and her crisis with discovering who she is and what she is meant to do in her life. A great story filled with destiny, hope, tragedy, and love.\tI think this book would make for an interesting read for students. It would also be great to expand this book across the curriculum by talking about Native Americans during that time for social studies, having students dry their own leather or fur for science, and many other different subjects. The text was easy enough to understand but still presented an interesting story. I think students can relate to this text because there will always be a family member that we lose to a certain sickness, so the reader can definitely relate to the story. \tI really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a great way to gleam some insight into the daily life of a Native American girl living in 1849. It also introduced a lot of unfamiliar and multicultural vocabulary such as makazins, which are what the characters wore in the book for shoes. I also loved how the chapters were broken up into seasons. This was a great way to introduce the changes the girl and her family had the make with each differing season. I would definitely recommend this book to my peers and students."}, {"userName": "Santorini", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35474652-santorini", "userReview": "I read this for a class. This review is written after class discussion of this book.This is the story of one year in a girl\u2019s life. This I find interesting for a couple of reasons. First, it makes you feel as if you are getting a window into Omakayas\u2019s everyday life. At times, this got a little boring due to the fact that there was no great adventure or sort of quest that must take place. While there were some tenser moments in the book, this set up reinforces a sense of normalcy. You are only getting a peak into Omakayas\u2019s life; she has had other years and will have more that will follow just like you and I do. I loved the character of Omakayas. I was a little hesitant when I had to start reading this book for class because I was afraid I would not be able to relate to it. However, Erdrich did a wonderful job of creating a three-dimensional character that I was able to appreciate and understand while also acknowledging that I come from a very different place than her. I am also a little curious as to the lack of mention of the impact white people were having on the Ojibwa tribe. I wonder if it was just because Omakayas was so young and didn\u2019t understand the details of what was going on, or maybe it was Erdrich shifting the focus from what the white people were doing to how the Ojibwa tribe was dealing with it. I find this an interesting perspective for Erdrich to take. She is dealing with stereotypes by not even mentioning them at all.Overall, I was very neutral to this book. I liked it, but it wasn\u2019t particularly life changing for me. It\u2019s a well-written children\u2019s book that will make you respect the Ojibwa culture."}], "description": "Nineteenth-century American pioneer life was introduced to thousands of young readers by Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved Little House books. With The Birchbark House, award-winning author Louise Erdrich's first novel for young readers, this same slice of history is seen through the eyes of the spirited, 7-year-old Ojibwa girl Omakayas, or Little Frog, so named because her first step was a hop. The sole survivor of a smallpox epidemic on Spirit Island, Omakayas, then only a baby girl, was rescued by a fearless woman named Tallow and welcomed into an Ojibwa family on Lake Superior's Madeline Island, the Island of the Golden-Breasted Woodpecker. We follow Omakayas and her adopted family through a cycle of four seasons in 1847, including the winter, when a historically documented outbreak of smallpox overtook the island. Readers will be riveted by the daily life of this Native American family, in which tanning moose hides, picking berries, and scaring crows from the cornfield are as commonplace as encounters with bear cubs and fireside ghost stories. Erdrich--a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwa--spoke to Ojibwa elders about the spirit and significance of Madeline Island, read letters from travelers, and even spent time with her own children on the island, observing their reactions to woods, stones, crayfish, bear, and deer. The author's softly hewn pencil drawings infuse life and authenticity to her poetic, exquisitely wrought narrative. Omakayas is an intense, strong, likable character to whom young readers will fully relate--from her mixed emotions about her siblings, to her discovery of her unique talents, to her devotion to her pet crow Andeg, to her budding understanding of death, life, and her role in the natural world. We look forward to reading more about this brave, intuitive girl--and wholeheartedly welcome Erdrich's future series to the canon of children's classics.
