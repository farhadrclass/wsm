I'm not sure if this is the same cowriter as the others, but this book needed another pass at the editor level.There are a lot of repeated phrases. A particular politician is \"one of the good ones\" a few times. Someone trying to not show emotion has a face carved of various things, usually granite, sometimes mahogany. One of them jokes about hurting their sacroliliac, which I'm not sure anyone under 60 or so says at this point.Flashlights die for no real reason. The Fargos make such brilliant choices as: There is unrest on the island, let's not stay on the safe boat because it doesn't meet our spoiled expectations. Oh, the unrest is getting worse. Let's go out for lunch. Someone just tried to kill us; let's go chase a robber in the dark, unarmed, alone. The main characters cover up a mass grave so they can go treasure hunting. This is not the Fargos as I've seen them before. The main story involves another unexpected archeological find. There are native legends, an uprising (committed by \"the rebel militia\" that never gets a name, double crosses, and links to war crimes from World War II. The book ends with a new discovery and another mystery that is never explained. This was a disappointment in the series. If the next one is like this, I will bow out on this one."}, {"userName": "Mike French", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6761276-mike-french", "userReview": "Another non stop ACTION thriller featuring the Fargo' s.

I played catch-up with all his books before that one, and then waited impatiently for each book after. However, I was disappointed in The Solomon Curse. Never in any of Cussler's books have people been graphically hacked to death with machetes, or children kidnapped and used for medical experimentation while chained to the wall of a cave. Until this one. Really? This is not classic Cussler. This is not what I waited two months on a library waiting list for. I truly hope this is not a sign of things to come."}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11615310-theresa", "userReview": "This has a different feel to it than most of Cussler\u2019s stories. Instead of Sam & Remy having a fantastic discovery or getting involved in a megalomaniac\u2019s dream to take over or something, it remains quiet and almost too peaceful though the first half. Lulling us into sleep. Even the archaeology part was just background.  Then later when the danger started happening, Sam seemed awfully calm in spite of all the bad stuff going on around him. It\u2019s like he was in denial. I think the Fargo\u2019s are getting too blas\u00e9 about everything. Both Leonid and Lazlo were boring with barely any real importance to the story. I knew off the bat who the real bad guy was and who the story\u2019s scape goat was. And it was a very odd ending. Felt like there should be more chapters. And what happened with the underwater buildings? For being the whole start of the book, they don\u2019t have a very big role in the story. They\u2019re just mentioned now and then as they check up on its progress. Maybe we\u2019ll see them in a future book. All and all, not as satisfying as it could have been. Quick Thoughts: 1)You\u2019d think Sam & Remi would have brought their own dive equipment. They\u2019re rich enough.  2)After all the buildup, does Leonid ever dive? Fave Scenes: trip to see Nauru, barricading the hospital, following the river clues, Manchester & Rollin\u2019s meeting."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27324982-john", "userReview": "The Sam & Remi Fargo novels are almost cookie-cutter. They get involved in a problem in an inaccessible, out-of-the-way location. They manage to get all of the material and equipment needed to get out of the situation. The prime mover in this series is really Selma, their office/research manager. Selma is able to arrange for anything, including air travel, fully equipped diving and research ships, and ex-Seal security people, on a moments notice, with almost immediate delivery. THE SOLOMOM CURSE is no exception. Set on the island of Guadalcanal, the Fargo's decimate the island rental car fleet in their search for a possible treasure trove. Cussler appears to have made one change in his writing style which I will not elaborate on because it would be a spoiler. Unfortunately, the Fargo series does not match up to Cussler's NUMA series (Dirk Pitt, Kurt Austin & company)or the OREGON series (Juan Cabrillo & company)."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809009-susan", "userReview": "The basic Clive Cussler formula:1.

Isaac Bell and Sam and Remi Fargo seem to work on smaller scales most of the time, which is probably to their benefit.Russell Blake follows up on his initial outing as Cussler's co-author with The Solomon Curse, a yarn that find our favorite anthropologist/archaeologist/multi-millionaire adventurer couple assisting a friend diving on a possible new find at Guadalcanal. The area is rumored by native villagers to be cursed, and just enough bad things happen that the Fargos and their friend lose all local help. But as they conduct their own dives and learn more about the potential discoveries of the site they're exploring, they realize they may uncover long-buried historical secrets -- that not everyone wants found, or at least not found by the Fargos. Civil unrest on the islands makes their situation a little more hazardous, and allows their enemies excellent cover should the interloping Americans suddenly disappear.Blake builds on his decent first outing, He sketches the turbulent political background of the Solomons quite well and uses it equally well to backlight his story and add danger for Sam and Remi. He tones down the couple's banter to more acceptable levels -- banter is good when well-done, but Blake is not yet the one to push those boundaries -- and makes several of the native characters more than just the equivalent of indigenous extras in a Tarzan movie. His main story about the treasure hunt and learning the possible secrets behind both its discovery and later attempts to hide it moves well, but the medical subplot stuffed into the corners makes little sense except as someplace to hide a villain.But he is improving, so there's no reason to let the Fargo series sail on its own way just yet.Original may be found here."}, {"userName": "Peter Sutton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5713534-peter-sutton", "userReview": "One of the worst to date. What is usually the main plot point, some type of underwater / archaeological site has little to anything to do with the plot. Luckily there are so many subplots, all basically irrelevant or poorly tied together, that it doesn't really matter. It must also be nice to know that as the main characters, you won't be killed off and will escape no matter what dangers you face. There's adventurous and brave, and then there's just stupid. The biggest escape they pull off is an escape from reality. I know that technically these are \"escapist\" literature, but there should be a touch of common sense and realism, otherwise it becomes too hard to swallow the adventure."}, {"userName": "Darlene Ferland", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3322358-darlene-ferland", "userReview": "Mr. Cussler has done it again!

Remi is almost completely useless and ignorant with a volatile temper and a sense of entitlement that basically sums up why people who hate Americans do. Sam is a complete idiot who continually endangers both his own life and the lives of others, flying completely in the face of fair warning and common sense. This couple has been on so many adventures and encountered bad guys of so many flavors that they should have learned a) a little more cynicism and b) a bucket - load more caution by now. As characters they have gone from being twee to being twits and it's just getting too much to bear. The book was written well enough, but not well enough to overcome the outright foolhardiness of its main characters. Even Selma was starting to annoy me. Plot - wise. ..meh.

The picture of a desperate nation state struggling to move forward against internal disruption and foreign interference is well captured even if the toing and froing of the protagonists from city to countryside, against all good sense, became monotonous for a while.

Not true to the Cussler way of writing-too much graphic violence, unexplained details, & unwise choices by the couple I'm used to feeling are super-smart. Also, maybe my imagination but I felt Remy's character was a bit more girly than I'm used to in other Fargo books. These two are a great team & each has their own skills, but worrying about her hair in tropical humidity? That just seemed uncharacteristic & silly to me!

Sam and Remi are the best husband and wife team of explorers that I know. Wealthy and determined to find the truth. I was totally surprised by Dr. Vanya in the book. She seemed to be very concerned about the residents of her island. Although I share Orwen Manchester's affinity for cold beer, I never trusted that his intentions were pure. Finding a treasure was secondary to the wicked plot conducted by the capitalists in this far flung part of the world. The myth of giants was partly proven by a discovery.

The worst part of the book for me was the conversation that seems unnatural between Sam and Remi including her team. Their jokes aren't even funny.
