It's about a woman in her late thirties - single, overweight freelance writer for a cooking magazine - who suddenly finds herself caring for her \"uncle\", who is really a close friend of her mother. I think the book is about to get really interesting (I'm on page 146 as I write this) and I can't wait to see what unfolds!Update: I'm nearly finished and have found a deeper respect for the author's message, although I'm not sure this book speaks to me personally. I have never had the task of being someone's live-in respite care nurse, but I have seen enough people struggle through this that I can relate to the situation. I find myself empathizing with Ellie and getting wrapped up in her story-line over the Uncle Benny story. It's interesting to think about family secrets and the life your parents had before they had you. I can also relate to using food as comfort until even food isn't enough. I actually found myself wishing the author had included the recipes for Ellie's creations!"}, {"userName": "Jojo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1324322-jojo", "userReview": "I thought this would be light chick-lit I could read during my convalescence, but, although the writer's style is a tad chick-litty (not that I'm complaining; so is mine), the real subjects here were family secrets, handling the terminal illness of a loved one, and learning to accept yourself even when your crazy-ass mother has done a number on your self-esteem. Oh - and food. There's a food reference on every page, it seems, and recipes are included at the back of the book.What I liked about the book: the relationships between the sisters was absolutely real to me. Although my sister and I have a beyond-wonderful relationship, the kind that other people openly envy, I like reading about sisters who have issues with each other, especially when they (like the sisters in this book) come together at the end to support one another. The weight thing - yes, Eleanor loses weight during the book, but by the end she has regained her curves and found a true love who appreciates her passion for food. The cat - that was a very cuddly cat, and I'm a dog person (in fact, I read the book on my Recovery Couch with my doggie lying on my feet). The guy - does he really exist and will he marry me? Honestly, the description of this guy made me fall madly in love with him. I love to get crushes on fictional characters, what can I say, I live in Fantasy World.The hospice - I do not have any personal knowledge of hospices but from what I know, the hospice described in this book is a very accurate representation. I wish that my grandmother had been able to go to a place like Benny's hospice; I think she would have had a much more peaceful death. Maybe I've been thinking about death too much lately, but I actually was really into the Benny section of the book. His character rang very true.The chick-lit aspect of the book - See, the problem I usually have with chick-lit is that most of it seems to follow a similar pattern: girl meets a bunch of guys, perhaps has a relationship with someone unworthy of her, then ends up with the guy you've known since page 3 was the one she would end up with. Meh. I like to be surprised, I like my heart to feel all tingly when I realize what's going to happen...And in this book, there really was only one guy, and he didn't appear right away, and when he did, he was immediately appealing. Yet - I still didn't know what was going to happen. There was even a wild thought in my mind that Henry would turn out to be a user (maybe a one-nighter with Anne?) and Eleanor would end up with Stefan, who wasn't really as perfect-looking as his picture. 'Cause that's probably the way I would have ended it, if I had written this...So any chick-littish book that can keep me guessing is awesome. Portland - I so want to go there. The ending, overall - I am fine with not having every question answered. I am happy assuming that Christine is Benny's child.What I didn't like - Mom. I totally did not buy into this character. Of course, I know from having my own stuff workshopped that the characters and situations that seem the least plausible are sometimes the most real aspects of the book. I just did not buy that this woman would marry Benny, take off on him and Rosemary, bring her younger daughters to visit Rosemary, then take a photography class with her secret ex-husband and make him a part of the family, alienating her current husband in the process...and then cut him out of her life, not even visiting him on his deathbed.Yolanda - It seemed like she was a plot device - just there to give Mom something to be pissed about. I didn't get why Yolanda and Benny had married in the first place, and I didn't get why she had taken off, or why she clearly loved him but didn't come back when he needed her. She was not a shrinking violet, she was a bold, colorful character; she could have told Mom to go to hell. The whole mystery thing - Yes, all families have secrets, but this just didn't ring true in any way. I actually thought it was kind of creepy how Benny came to Portland and took over, pushing the kids on their swings, etc., when poor Dad - although he was not a sympathetic character, either - had done nothing to deserve that. Dad was probably worn out from dealing with Mom and raising kids he suspected were not his own. Eleanor told the story from the point of view of an adult, looking back on her childhood, but there were too many missing pieces. Anyway - I will definitely read more from this author. This was an ideal book for my convalescence, which is (regretfully?) coming to an end, so now I probably won't get to Jennie Shortridge's other books until summer."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1866026-lisa", "userReview": "At first I thought this book might be chick-lit light or have too many issues tucked into it to be believable.

This book didn't seem like my usual fare at first, but I gave it a shot and was hooked from the first page. Shortridge is a really good writer. The main character Eleanor Samuels is a food writer, but not just any food writer, she's also got an eating disorder and can't stop eating things that aren't healthy. And she's not happy with the crap articles she's been churning out. Most of the book is about her caring for her \"uncle\" Benny who needs constant care because he has stage !V cancer. Eleanor immediately moves in with him so he can qualify for at home hospice care. She brings all the things she really needs, including her computer and cat and her life is basically turned upside down caring and cooking for her uncle. Slowly she begins disvoering things about her uncle and her mother that she didn't know previously, mostly through looking at his photo albums. So two stories are basically going on, Elenaor's struggles with food and her determination to give her uncle end of life care. And there's a love interest also with Henry, a chef she interviewed for an article. For not exactly my typical action/thriller novel, this book proved a compelling read, but the end was a sad tear-jerker and her final resolution with food issues felt a bit contrived. Also when she cared for her Uncle I wondered about issues with Medical insurance or Medicare, because these are big parts of the health care picture. Was this purpously left out because it might have been distracting to the theme? I missed that part of the reality of caring for someone with a late stage disease. There were poignant moments and laugh out loud moments, but the end was too well-wrapped and neat for my taste."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21458131-deborah", "userReview": "This book was a bit painful to read for me with the one aspect of Uncle Benny's terminal illness, because it was so familiar to me with my own family. But the other aspects of the book were so well written, and interesting that I had to read the whole book. The story line of main character Eleanor, and her free lance cutting calorie articles, and her passion for food and food preparation were great. Eleanor is imperfect, chubby, lonely, introverted, the family outcast, and addicted to sweets, with no apologies. She just is what she is. Her very imperfection made her believable, real, and very likeable. She just was the star in this book. I loved her. Especially easy to read was her independence, and her nurturing personality that was the anchor of Eleanor's personality. The mystery of the strange and vague family dynamics, Benny, Eleanor's mom and dad, and Yolanda was very well done, flashing back in time with perfect descriptions of how the mom dressed, her lipstick, her sundresses, the family BBQ-ing in the back yard, the dad and his emotional removal from the core family, it was realistic and made the book.  Ms Shortridge really nailed the descriptive verbage in this book for any foodie. The fact that sea salt was the catalyst that pushed Eleanor to re connect with Henry made me smile and rang true to life.The only factors that could have improved this book for me would have been more depth on Eleanor's career, her writing, and her articles, where they went, who they reached, etc. And perhaps more depth on the Rosemary story with Bennie and her mom. All in all, a very memorable read, and 4 stars for me."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23248374-trish", "userReview": "I'd call this a chick lit that delves into some heavy issues: terminal illness, caregiving, food issues, etc. There are some fun, light moments scattered throughout the story as well as lots of discussion about food (and a few recipes at the end). I enjoyed itBUTI hated the way things wrapped up so neatly. Disordered eating - especially when it's been present since childhood - is not just going to magically get better in a few months. And I hated that her \"getting better\" in the final chapter is linked to finding love. And frankly her \"How to Eat\" final manifesto is beyond ridiculous. Don't eat when you're not hungry - yeah, because it's that simple.Next point of contention: people don't get along just because someone is dying (frankly my experience has been that it tends to create even more drama as emotions are running so high).And lastly, I just find all the weird revelations to have been absurd. The other child that they'd met but NO ONE remembers? Just. Not. Buying. It.I enjoyed the writing itself and would consider reading something else by this author, though."}, {"userName": "Yolanda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1429861-yolanda", "userReview": "As I was reading this book, and I felt like I am missing the mark. The main character was seriously pathetic. I don\u2019t think I have ever eaten like this before in my life. I mean shoveling food into my mouth without a fork in my car like an animal\u2026 are you kidding me?Is this how other plus sized women live? Am I not the norm? Is my eating when I am sad (always with a spoon or fork) or when I am stressed not how the other half of the obese population lives? Does the rest of plus sized civilization eat when they know they shouldn\u2019t (behind a dumpster, embarrassed) and eat cake out of a pan without a fork or servings meant for 6 people? I don\u2019t want to appear oblivious\u2026 but I was so confused\u2026 and angry.As I continued to read, I realized that this woman's pain was deep rooted in depression and her feelings of inadequacies. I don't recommend this book if you are looking for quick easy read. It deals with depression, eating disorders, and losing a loved one. I was tempted to put this book down. But I am so glad I pushed through my own personal feelings about the main character. I also loved how the ending was realistic and not all sunshine and rainbows."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2649683-susan", "userReview": "Eleanor Samuels is a very special heroine and while reading this novel I felt that she was a real person.

On the one hand, there's the theme or the main character's relationship to food and her body, and on the other, there's a narrative of family relationships and secrets. I think Shortridge does a better job with the latter - the family's story is complex and intriguing, though the book doesn't delve deeply enough into the characters and their motivations for me. The food and body theme, though, was really poorly addressed. The narrator's body and food issues are painful to read in the beginning, but in a way that is realistic for a lot of women in our society. But then those issues sort of disappear with only the flimsiest of reasons. I didn't buy the transformation, and a more realistic account of the protagonist's changing attitudes and self-esteem would have been much more compelling.

I only have one sister, but I could relate to the ups and downs of their relationships. Also, her uncle is dying from cancer and she is his primary caregiver. Let me tell you, in case you ever wondered, her descriptions of what it's like to care for someone dying from cancer are dead-on. The author cared for her stepmother when she was dying, so she knows firsthand. No research necessary. It brought back a lot of memories, some good, some painful, but I thought she treated the subject with accuracy and dignity. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because her problem with binging/starving herself/food issues in general seems a bit too nicely resolved in the end. I don't quite buy it.

There's also the budding relationship between Eleanor and the hot new chef in town.
