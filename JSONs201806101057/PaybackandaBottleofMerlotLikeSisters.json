The relationship with Aaron was a complete farce. I wanted to skip over their dialogue because it was like listening to high schoolers flirt.Reggie the dog pops up out of no where and apparently, he isn't a toy poodle like I imagined. Still not sure what kind of dog he is...Hooking up with a hot camp counsellor, and screwing him in the woods with a sprained ankle, then him being a perfect gentleman, but then staying friends? Are you insulting my intelligence?And the ex wives hooking up with the mistress for revenge and this smoking hot model is actually not a snob but kind? No...I'm sorry. That does not happen. Ever. Not even if she was Tyra Banks.This is a book written from the mindset of a high school girl scorned by her boyfriend. That's the best way to describe it. It's a good read if you like real life fantasy without anything going wrong, but realistically, just not a good story overall."}, {"userName": "Tracy Kellies", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31959120-tracy-kellies", "userReview": "I found this book very far-fetched and juvenile. It was poorly written and did not really have a natural flow to it. The story was also dragged out and might have been better if it was a short novella. With that being said, it was actually an entertainingly funny read. The overall concept was intriguing and was a great story on how women scorned can be vengeful. The plot is also very similar to the movie, The Other Woman..."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6913994-megan", "userReview": "This book was AWFUL. It was poorly written, and I swear, if I saw the word \"moaned\" or \"shaft\" one more time, I was going to scream! By the end, I was just laughing my head off at the romantic scenes. I am usually a lover of any book with a dog in it, but poor Reggie was just an afterthought. \"Oh yeah, time to walk the dog.\" (Spoiler ahead...but not really because it's pretty obvious) Mia and her friends are petty and bizarre, and how realistic is it for you to become immediate and fast friends with the ex-wife and current mistress of your slimeball husband? Couldn't stand this book."}, {"userName": "Sophie Narey (Bookreview- aholic)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37868613-sophie-narey-bookreview--aholic", "userReview": "Published: 14/12/2014Author: Bria MarcheRecommended for: fans of 'chick lit'Edition: KindleI found this novel on the Kindle Store for free and so I thought that I would give it a try. This novel is a lighthearted and fun story to read, it isn't serious and has a few funny moments in it. The main character Mia is very well developed and described in this book (which can be read as a stand alone book) and her group of friends are all very likeable and relateable. It is a rather girly book, which does contain some real life situations that some might be able to relate too."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859560-amy", "userReview": "Man these free Kindle reads are not that great - but they're free and quick and easy and great to fill in between runs to the library. Once again this one had some glaring grammatical/word use errors.

OH NO, was this bad. How bad, you ask? So, impossibly bad.Mia's shitty husband is verbally and emotionally abusive, a liar, a cheater, and very secretive, and all her friends and family hate him (there is no good explanation for why she married him, or why he married her). I expected a cute girl power book where Mia tells the other woman that Jack is a jerk and a liar and they tell him to fuck off. Instead, Mia and her horrible friends team up with Jack's ex-wife to concoct a cruel and elaborate plan to involve the other woman in a twisted scheme that will cost Jack his job. Meanwhile, Mia herself cheats on Jack, starts dating another guy whom she didn't have any romantic feelings for from high school until age 33, and then lies to his face about cheating -- despite everything Jack has done to her. The sex scenes read like a virgin who read one issue of Cosmo and doesn't know how condoms work. The only good thing about this book was that it ended."}, {"userName": "Hasanthi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70608821-hasanthi", "userReview": "This was my very first book of Bria Marche. The story was epic and I am so glad I purchased the book via Amazon. I put away everything else to finish this one off. From the very beginning it was super exciting. I loved Mia and her friends so very much. Being betrayed by your husband, while he pretends to the whole wide world that he is happily married is a terrible situation. Mia getting to who her husband really is and how her friends stand by her side is great. The value of true friendship, love, honesty and understanding are the most important values described in the story. Aaron is a guy whom all the girls in this world would love to have. It was super exciting to read each chapter of the story on how they plan to unveil the truth and how everything ends in a wonderful way. Thoroughly enjoyed the story!!!!"}, {"userName": "Em", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47686061-em", "userReview": "Payback and a bottle of Merlot.The book was free. Thank you. Full credit for writing the book. Would have been good chicklit at half the word count and sharper tighter scenarios. Needs proof reader.The Merlot and Reggie the dog were the heroes. Of course the Merlot was non alcoholic, not (with all the drinking and driving)Reggie gets a Kindle Oscar 'for dog with the strongest bladder' and as for the heroine, Mia, to her goes a shovel to remove the .....as for me, I could not write a book, so well done on that score and better luck with next one.As for the introduction of Max in the last chapters, unnecessary eye-candy for a quick romp betwixt cheating ass husband and faithful hound Aaron. A good Private Investigator and a sleazy lawyer would given the story a little credenceThank you for the free book. I stayed with it to the end. Would have been a good effort except for overly long descriptive sentences. Characters shallow in the extreme no depth. Too long to get to the climax, then it pluttered out or was it me who lost the thread.

As much as I hate cheaters, I feel like the girls went above and beyond with their payback... there has to be quite a lot of bad inside to be able to do that even in those circumstances. Why not just give the photos his boss let them know who he really is, let Sasha know who he really is without the grand scheming? I guess that would not a godd book make...Right through out we hear of Mia's dog... he is mentioned so many times, but it is impossible visualise as we are told nothing about him... not how big he is or what breed or even the colour of his fur...Then it's the other men in Mia's life... that's right I said MEN... Multiple guys... So of course there is the cheating ass of a husband, then the best friend who has always wanted Mia, flirted with Mia and \"joked\" about marrying and having a family with her (as a married woman, she should not have let this go on)... and finally there is Max, and I'm still unsure what the point of your affair with him was, truthfully makes Mia a cheater just like her husband, it doesn't matter if it was just once. Just being friends with Max would have worked.Overall, okay storyline however I think it would have been better as a novella and not dragged so long."}, {"userName": "Jayme Carruthers", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6782791-jayme-carruthers", "userReview": "Meet Mia. She's a beautiful blonde who is married to a jerk named Jack. He's constantly spending the night in the city (without her). He doesn't care about her friends. He really doesn't seem to care about her at all. He's supposed to have split custody with his ex-wife, but Mia has never even MET his daughter that he goes into the city to see all the time.Fast forward to the moment that Mia discovers the reason Jack is always gone late at night. He's got a hot mystery model that he's giving a LOT of attention to. Instead of immediately filing for divorce, Mia decides she needs some payback. Along with her friends Vic and Tina, she comes up with this outlandish scheme to bring him down. Somewhere along the way, they become best friends with Jack's ex-wife Karen AND the mystery woman and bring Jack the justice he deserves.This novel was so fun! A lot of the reviews on Goodreads are pretty bad, but I happened to like it. To each their own I guess? I thought it was a cute, easy-to-read novel that really highlighted the friendship these women had. Sure, the scheme was probably a bit immature for women their age, and sure Mia's little side crushes were pretty predictable, but it was all in good fun. I would (and have) recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick, easy, fun read about a woman finding herself and a cheater getting caught."}, {"userName": "Jo-Anne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9792550-jo-anne", "userReview": "This is a fun story about Mia finding out her husband is cheating. Hard to believe but it really is humorous. I loved the way she decided to get payback before divorcing him. Mia calls in her two friends, Vic and Tina, to help with her plan. It gets even better when she pulls in his ex-wife and even his mistress!Some of the things these women think of doing to Jack the Jerk (Mia's husband) are hilarious. Of course they have wine while meeting to hash out the details of plan. What would a meeting of friends be without wine? The characters are terrific. Mia is a very smart woman who is a professional photographer. Her skills come in handy to pull off the payback plan. All the women are very good in their fields which they make use of to get even with Jack. I wish I had friends like that.If you're looking for a fun story I'd recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1745409-heather", "userReview": "I didn't absolutely hate this book but I also didn't love it. It was written with short disjointed sentences and some things were added in unnecessary. I also thought the plot was kind of ridiculous. It was unrealistic and felt like forced.

I'm not ready for a similar read, so choose something lighter; entirely different. This was my inbetween book.

With a little help from her friends and a lot of Merlot, Mia was on a mission to take Jack down.
