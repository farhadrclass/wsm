They know that they are deeply in love at first sight! I know this must sound like a mushy gushy romance novel but it is actually the historical tale of Honara, Michael and their devotion to their children and family. This is a thoroughly researched novel based on the author's great, great grandmother who survived the potato famine and left Ireland with her sister Maire and eight children between them for Amerikay (what they called America). After trying to hold out through the genocide by starvation of the British rule and the combination of the blight of their mainstay food, potatoes, they finally decide to make the journey to a safe place to survive. Little did they know that the road ahead wasn't all that they had dreamed of, but offered such great challenges that they had to show their true strength to survive. They arrived in New Orleans where the weather was warm and there was plenty to eat but Honara was determined to go to Chicago, still a frontier town, where Michael's brother, a union organizer and rebel, had last been seen. They set out on a boat going upriver and arrive on Chicago's outskirts only to find they are not as well received as they had expected to be and their survival in this frontier town depended on extreme fortitude by all of them.This is a truly great saga of the changing times of family life in Ireland and America.

Why? 1. Instant true love as the main character sees a man come out of the water (with a boner, no less, cause she's a hottie)Love at first sight is pure poppycock. I almost threw the book.2. All the, \"I'm from county so and so, next to county so and so, where this famous person lived after coming from county of so and so\". zzzzzzzzzz.3. All that Irish! I guess I should have looked upon it as a lesson in a part of my heritage (where else did this passion for Guinness come from?) But I had to keep referencing the translations in the back... and I hate that. At least with Spanish I can understand and keep reading, not having to pause to look up a phrase. I'm very thankful I kept going. The story was very... enchanting. I think that's the perfect word for it. Enchanting.Love, heartbreak, adventure, trials, tribulations... it was honestly a very interesting book. The sweet thing is, it touches on some interesting history - the horrors of the potato famine and the civil war - all from the author's personal family history. (I can't go back that many generations!

The Bay is her home and her family's livelihood since her father is a fisherman in the village of Bearna. She is sixteen years old and pledged to the church. She will join the convent as a novice nun in a few months, a great honor to so poor an Irish family as the Keeleys.But that morning will change the course of Honora's life. Out of the sea, fresh from an early swim, walks a beautiful young man, tall, dark haired. Michael Kelly. Within the space of an hour there is no going back, fate has brought them together and they are determined to be married.There are obstacles. Michael is not a fisherman, has no land or money. But, despite the problems, they are wed and they are happy. Maire is not, she is quickly widowed and then is forced to become a servant to a tyrant landlord. She is the one bleak spot in the otherwise happy life of the Kellys. They have a small farm at the top of a hill overlooking the Bay and, though the work is hard and the rent high, they manage to feed their growing family and find joy together.\"I was used to the give-and-take of a large family, where one broke in on the other, splintering sentences, bouncing thought away from meaning. But Michael and I listened to each other, each waiting as the other found words for what we'd never said before, never even thought before, giving shape to dreams and to fears. I'd no idea I was such a worrier - the ifs and buts that flowed out of me. Michael teased them away.\"And then the unthinkable happens. In 1845 the potato harvest, the staple of the Irish peasant diet, is blighted and rots in the ground. The hunger and suffering that winter is terrible. When the potato crop fails two out of the following three years, the result is millions of deaths. The landlords and the British rulers do not care and attempts to help are mired down in bureaucracy and are ineffectual. Honora watches her children starve, her neighbors die, and she dreams of finding the means to escape, to buy passage to another place where her family can live and grow: America. She is far from the only one, the ships are filled with Irish immigrants trying to find a better life. The voyage is dangerous and many die before they even reach North America. But some make it and they send back the means for the next one to escape. An entire race of people, trying to rescue each other. She does escape, with her family and Maire's. Not without losses and terrible grief, but Honora has strength of spirit, strength of character, strength of will to sustain her loved ones and find a place where they can prosper. All great historical fiction is rooted in fact and Galway Bay is no exception. Mary Pat Kelly is the great-great-granddaughter of Honora Keeley Kelly. The author has followed the great Irish storytelling tradition and created this fictionalized account of her own ancestors, an epic saga of one family's journey through one of the darkest hours in human history. It is a story of faith, of family lore and ancient tales, of great suffering and the triumph of the human spirit. I am, as so many Americans must be today, part Irish. This book brings home the terrible destruction of the Great Hunger in a way that has never been clear to me before. Because it is personal story, one family's struggle that could be any family from that place and that time. Fiction, maybe, but with the weight of truth behind it."}, {"userName": "LemonLinda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1541888-lemonlinda", "userReview": "From the \"before\" times in Ireland, tough because of the English system of land ownership, but blissful when compared to the near starvation that came with the blight through to two generations later in \"Amerikay\" where the family is growing, thriving and succeeding in making a \"better\" life, this saga is tender and exciting, hopeful and unsettling. But throughout I loved it. I loved the story, the characters, the setting and most of all the knowledge that all of the efforts for Ireland finally did come to fruition, albeit after the novel ends.We begin in Galway Bay with Honora Keeley on the day of her sister's wedding where she meets by chance the love of her life, Michael Kelly. There is much against their making it together but they do overcome any objections and begin building a life of honest hard work. Soon, however, the potato blight takes them to the brink of starvation and the English landowners finally kick them out forcing the reduced family to make the dreaded journey to Amerikay. Honora and her sister, Mairee, are strong women and fight for survival and success for their large families in Chicago. We follow them through the joys and despairs of the next 50 years. This was loosely based on the story handed down from the great-great-grandmother of the author and was well-researched, well-written and so completely captivating. I had recently read another Irish story following much of the same time period. But this one brought another perspective - that of so many Irish who left their country as they were forced to do so but never lost their love of country, culture and a distinctive heritage."}, {"userName": "Wendi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1481319-wendi", "userReview": "Perfect for : Personal reading, book club readIn a nutshell: I was very interested in this story as my husband's side of the family can claim ties to Ireland, and my grandmother immigrated here from Norway (yes, NOT Ireland, but in a way, I feel I can understand what she went through on her journey here a little better after reading this book). I was hoping to learn a little more about the Irish history, and what it was like to travel to America, and I was not disappointed. This is a wonderfully written story that follows the Kelly family. We get a glimpse of life prior to the the potato famine, and then we see how the Irish were treated as they were starving and trying to survive.This is a story of strength and survival that will keep you riveted. I was amazed by what I learned, and found that I was enthralled by this family who refused to give up, and instead traveled to America to start over. Even more amazing, Honora Kelly was actually the author's great-great-grandmother, which gives the story even more of a lasting impact.Extended Review:Characters: The characters within the book were wonderfully written and developed. I grew very attached to the members of the Kelly family and found myself amazed at what they were able to accomplish.Story-Line: I can only imagine the amount of time that the author put into her research. The story is amazing and highly detailed, giving the reader quite a nice glimpse into the history of both Ireland and America in the 1800's.Readability: The book is long, but will capture your attention and hold it from the first chapter, until the end of the book.Overall: I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Irish immigration to America following the potato famine, and to anyone with Irish ancestors. The strength of the Kelly family, and their will to survive is a wonderful testament. This would also be a wonderful book club read due to the number of things that will spark discussions, although you might want to allow a little more time than normal due to the size of the book."}, {"userName": "Juliet Doubledee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4350318-juliet-doubledee", "userReview": "Couldn't have finished Galway Bay at a better time, St. Patrick's Day. This book was so much more than I had expected, and gave me a good feeling for what the Irish went through during the Potato Famine, and what led many to emigrate to America.Written in a first person perspective by Honore Keeley Kelly, this book tells the story of a young woman who evolves from a school girl (who had aspirations of becoming a nun) into a strong woman who will do whatever needed to help her family survive the Potato Famine, emigration to America, and participating in the U.S. Civil War. Set in the mid 1800s in the village of Bearna, off Galway Bay, Honore and her family must deal from day-to-day with the social bias' that they as Irish Catholics are considered the underclass by the landowning Anglo-Irish gentry, and little more than pack animals. Catholics made up 80% of the population during this period, the bulk of whom lived in conditions of poverty and insecurity not allowed to own land, thus forced to rent homes from the land owners. The majority of their yearly income went towards this rent, and at anytime they could be evicted (rent paid or not). Honore's family brought in much of their income from fishing the bay and selling the catch in Galway City. Since most the profit went towards rent, they depended on the potatoes they grew on the side to sustain their family. Others in the village tended the crops of grain that are grown on the Anglo-Irish gentries land. They also lived on potatoes they grew at home, because they couldn't afford to buy the Anglo-Irish owned grain at market price. This system enslaved the people of Ireland to depend on the potato for daily nutrition.The book begins in June 1839, the day of Honore's older sister Maire's wedding; she has just been accepted into the first Catholic Convent to be established in 200 years in Galway City, and is unsure about her future. As she walks along the beach near her home looking out onto Galway Bay her eyes are drawn to a dark object bobbing in the waves. At first she thinks it is only a seal, but as the object gets closer she realizes that it is a person. Rushing to the shore to see if she can assist if this person is drowning, Honore comes face-to-face with Michael Kelly, and instantly the two are drawn to each other. Honore realizes at that moment that she will not be joining the convent but instead her life will be with this handsome, dark haired young man with the sparkly blue eyes.The book then takes off describing the trials and tribulations of the young couple; from introducing Michael to her family, getting her parents to understand she no longer wants to join the church, and finally assuring them that he will be able to support her as his wife. Michael is not a fisherman, like her father, brothers, new brother-in-law Johnny, or any of the other men she knows. Instead Michael has been raised to be a blacksmith, and aspires to compete in the yearly Galway Races on a mare he has raised himself named Champion. In the end he does enter the race after being sponsored by the Honorable Marcus Lynch (who rents to Honore's family), and against the odds wins. The prize money is set aside to rent a parcel of land (to be divided between farming, raising horses, and trying to set up a forge for blacksmithing) which the couple will live on after marrying. From the beginning of their marriage though they are harassed by a cruel land owner, Major Pyke, who feels it his right to abuse the tenants. Also, there is friction with the local priest, as he is unwilling to release Maire from her marriage vows when her husband Johnnie is lost in a freak storm at sea, because the body was never found. This leads to much trauma for the widow, and for Honore.By 1845 the couple have built on their dreams with fertile land that Michael's half-brother Patrick has taught them to farm, a thriving horse breeding business, and three children. One evening just before the harvest season begins they see a strange fog hovering above their potato crop and smell the putrid stench of rot. They find most all the spuds are now balls of black mush infected with an unknown fungus. This marks the beginning of the famine. With the blight wiping out the potato crop many who have grown dependent on this food source begin to die. The landlords and the British rulers do not care and attempts to help are mired down in bureaucracy and are ineffectual. It is estimated that over 1 million people die (20-25% of the population) during the famine which ran from 1845-1852.Honora watches her children starve, her neighbors die, miscarries a baby because of malnutrition, and begins to search for a means of escape so she and her family will not perish. After praying year after year for a good season of potatoes, and only a forth of the crop being edible, it's decide in order to survive they must join the millions who are booking passage to America. The voyage is dangerous and many die of the fever before they even reach North America. But some make it and they send back the means for the next ones to escape. An entire race of people, trying to rescue each other.In many places in the book you can't help but feel touched as you hear of the agony these people went through and how heartless their government was. To them America represented a new beginning and something to give them hope for.Unfortunately, for many upon arrival during this time period they were exposed to America's problem, the slave issue, and the Civil War. In some cases families who had been separated during travel found themselves on opposite sides of the issue, and brother was forced to fight brother.So much was discussed in this book, and when I finally reached the end to realize it was roughly based on the authors family history (Honore was in fact the author May Kay Kelly's great-great-grandmother) it touched me even more. I strongly recommend this book to those who love history, and those who enjoy a touching love story!"}, {"userName": "Corinne Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/875001-corinne-edwards", "userReview": "I have never actually used the phrase \"tour de force\" when describing a book, but I can't think of anything else that defines a work that covers as much ground as Galway Bay. We meet Honora Kelley when she's a young woman, the world ahead of her, living in a costal village on Galway Bay on the western shores of Ireland. The story begins in the \"before times,\" when Ireland is under the harsh hand of the British and the Irish have little to their name beyond the potato to eat and the joy of each other's company. When Honora finds true love and begins her own family, the situation in Ireland becomes frantically desperate.I hate to give away much of the plot of a book, but I can't NOT tell you that Honora's journey eventually leads her far from the homeland she loves, because the author's depiction of a mid-19th century immigrant experience is one of the elements of this book that makes it so powerful. I can't imagine the amount of research that went in to creating such a believable depiction of Chicago during that time period. As someone very familiar with Chicago, it was thrilling to read a history of the city between the lines of a story that I could not put down.Life was not easy for Honora. I didn't bother to count the number of times that the sheer magnitude of trials Honora went through brought me to tears. I rooted for her, I cried for her and the people she loves. As hard as her experiences were, though, I felt like she triumphed. Honora's love of her family, her imperfections, her willingness to scrabble forward, whatever the cost, these qualities made her an incredibly sympathetic and realistic protagonist. The Irish love of stories and tales, song and music are a constant thread throughout, woven through the generations and tying them together.Galway Bay is a glorious yarn, stretching from the hills and beaches of Ireland to the streets of Chicago. For all of it's 500+ pages, I wouldn't leave out a one. An Irish-American history that must simply be read to be believed."}, {"userName": "Beth ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721785-beth", "userReview": "Mary Pat Kelly\u2019s GALWAY BAY is a 551-page story of the Keeley and Kelly families beginning in Ireland in 1839 all the way to their lives in Chicago and their get-together at the Chicago World Fair in 1893. While the book is fiction, it is based on the lives of Mary Pat Kelly\u2019s own ancestors and stories told to her by her cousin, Sister Mary Erigina, who lived to be 107. Mary Pat Kelly grew up on these stories told to her by this book\u2019s narrator, Honora Keeley Kelly, who really was Mary Pat Kelly\u2019s great-great grandmother.But GALWAY BAY isn\u2019t just stories of Mary Pat Kelly\u2019s ancestors. You want to read this for its accurate historical details that Kelly researched for 35 years in both Ireland and the U.S. It covers so much that I thought I knew but didn\u2019t. And the advantage to its being historical fiction rather than a history book is that the reader can feel how people lived through these times.For example, I learned details about living through the Irish Potato Famine that I never knew before. I was ignorant to think the Potato Famine is capitalized because of a terrible blight that killed the Irish potato crops. That, alone, wouldn\u2019t have been enough to send them packing for Canada and the U.S. or to merit capitalization. It was the blight three years in a row combined with English laws that seemed designed to wipe out the Irish and, indeed, did lead to so many deaths they were almost annihilated.GALWAY BAY is full of many other examples of historical events and people. It might make you want to learn more, especially if you, too, have ancestors who lived through this.

Despite the odds against them, they manage to marry and find a place to live and farm and do as well as can be expected under the British oppression - that is until the potato blight hits.

The family's story then takes them through the Civil War, the Fenian Rising of 1867, the great fire and Chicago's World's Fair (Columbian Exposition). While it's not a five star book IMO, I really enjoyed this one, especially the first parts in Ireland - the accounts of the Great Famine were horrendous, as well the ignorance and bigotry of the English government as they sat on their hands and watched so many die such horrible deaths. I also enjoyed their early days in Chicago as they struggled to find employment and keep a roof over their heads. My only complaint is the last 75 or so pages tended to drop off and things got pretty slow as the author wrapped it up. I know that the Irish had large families with lots of kids and grandkids, but finally my head was spinning trying to keep track of them all. Perhaps a family tree for the paperback edition would help readers keep them straight? Lastly, there is a lovely glossary in the back listing many of the Irish expressions used in the book and how to pronounce them.

It seems very juvenile and all the dialog is trite and unreal. It feels like something I would've written in grade school or jr. high.the story isn't very interesting and not at all believable yet. the characters aren't exactly lovable, they aren't unlikeable, but I'm not fond of them yet. They seem very 2 dimensional.I usually feel quite compelled to get into & finish a book when I start, but I started this one on Friday and have only picked it up again once since then. Don't really care about what happens. Maybe this will be one of the rare times I don't finish a book. We'll see....on pg 145 now. The story has gotten more interesting now that they're all starving and beginning to fight the Brits. The characters are still undeveloped and I don't feel an attachment to them yet. One frustrating thing the author does is totally skip details. She'll rev you up about some big thing that is going to happen, and then just say, \"it happened' without describing it. The horse race probably had the best description of anything that has gone on so far and it has covered 7 years in the book. I think the horse race took 2 pages. She seems to drag out unimportant, boring things like get -togethers and parties, and skim over exciting and important things like fights, protests, starvation, relationships etc.The book started to get more exciting and devastating and I ended up really liking it. I especially liked that it was based on history, a true family, a real woman and her progeny. I think that's my favorite part about the whole thing. Makes me want to write similar books about my own ancestors. The amazing, horrible things they went through, the strength and courage, the resiliency and gratitude they showed. We could learn so much from them. lately I've felt bad that I've had to feed my kids Ramen noodles every day for lunch because we've been going through 'hard' times.

The time period is 1839 to 1893. Honora Kelly is the main character and the story is told first person through her voice. It is at times a heartbreaking tale of loss, starvation, war, and oppression. The Irish potato famine of 1846-49 is recounted in vivid detail as Honora and her family first struggle to survive in Ireland and then struggle to survive just to leave for a new life in America. The English (\u201cSassenach\u201d in Gaelic) are presented as oppressive as ever in trying to exterminate the Irish through eviction and starvation. All of the Irish grown food (livestock, oats, barley, wheat, etc.) is taken and exported to Britain, leaving the Irish with only the potato (\u201cpratties\u201d). When the blight hits the Irish are devastated. Honora and her family, after much trial and hardship, finally leave for America. Landing in New Orleans and traveling the Mississippi to Chicago. There they find welcome by the Irish community in a Chicago suburb and manage their way along until the Civil War. Many Irish fought and died on both sides, often times against each other. The book ends with Honora aged and reflective; wondering how she is to pass on Ireland\u2019s storied history to her issue. So many have left their homeland and lost their sense of being Irish, but she sees that deep down, there is something there that each clings to that stirs in their identity and makes them Irish. I appreciated the author\u2019s willingness to allow Honora to cling steadfastly to her Roman Catholic faith. Honora unabashedly continued to uphold her faith through every trial; even when the Sassenach would give the Irish charity during the famine if they would just convert to Protestantism, Honora and her family continued their faith. During the Civil War, when her children were away and in danger, Honora prayed for them and her other family by making Stations every day of the week, having a Holy Hour in front of the Eucharist every night, and saying Rosaries. All in all, a great story, even if it does tend a little too much toward the romantic at times for my tastes. I love Ireland, being Catholic, and staying true to who you are. This book is about all three."}, {"userName": "Ada Bonnefoi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15498438-ada-bonnefoi", "userReview": "Mary Pat Kelly has made the life of her great-grandmother Honora Keeley Kelly (1822 - 1899) into a decades-spanning work. The daughter of a fisherman from Galway Bay married Michael Kelly and farmed with him a small piece of land. During the difficult 1840s, the Irish sell almost their entire harvest to apply the totally overpriced rent for their miserable little houses. For their own food needs they are dependent on the potato crop. In the mid 1840s, due to fungal infestation are three bad harvests. Thousands of lives are lost.Many Irish emigrated to America to escape the certain starvation in their homeland. Also Honora and her sister Maire, both widowed young, take the perilous journey into the unknown to themselves, and for their children's survival. The sisters and eventually their adolescent children and grandchildren build a life out of poverty, gradually and moderately prosperous into a big, happy family.The novel is divided into five parts: the first part deals with the true humble, yet happy life before the famine (1839-1845), the second part tells about the time of catastrophic crop failure (1845 -1848), the third part begins with the emigration to America (1848). The fourth section is followed by a bigger leap in time and describes the years of the Civil War, where the sons of Honora and Maire participate. The relatively short fifth section presents the now extended by grandchildren and great grandchildren family in 1893.\"Galway Bay\" is written in a very appealing narrative style that brings the reader not only the narrator Honora, but also their children very close and generate much empathy. Irish phrases and expressions are woven again and again in the text. The book also contains some stories from Irish mythology Honora heard as a young girl by her grandmother."}, {"userName": "Melly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5797709-melly", "userReview": "There are hardly words to describe the magic of this book, the ability of Kelly to whisk you away to 1830s Ireland and leave you stranded there, starving and hopeful as the Irish who lived it. She injects magic into a sad story, love into a dark situation. Michael and Honora are drawn as if by fate to each other and set out to make a beautiful home out of a marshy hill. They have a beautiful family, then are struck by the Great Starvation where three years out of four they're forced to scrape and stretch to feed their family, to save them from the fate of many other families. Michael does what he must to provide for his family and when he dies of fever, my heart broke for Honora. But Honora didn't let it bring her down. She pushes on to New Orleans then Chicago, determined to provide better for her family. The struggles of Honora and Maire, her sister, and their combined 8 or 9 kids are fascinating. You can't stop rooting for them as they disagree, they fight, they fall into each other's arms in misery, and help each other deal with the loss of fathers, brothers, sons, husbands, mothers. And all that just before the Civil War hits and the sisters again find themselves not knowing whether their family will survive another day. Sons die, sons and daughters marry, and Honora finds a second love in her brother-in-law. (Less weird than it sounds.) The end of the book becomes boring as Kelly flies through successive generations, causing them to reproduce before you even get to know them. The raw, bald feelings are the real draw of this book. You FEEL what they feel, you FEAR what they fear, you're emotionally invested in their futures. That is the magic of this book. In the end you agree with the assessment of Honora's eldest son, Paddy when he asks, more or less, why do these things keep happening to us, Mam?"}, {"userName": "Siobian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1362023-siobian", "userReview": "Honora Keeley has lived her entire life in Galway Bay as a fisherman's daughter and is about to give up all thoughts of marriage to join the nuns. However, before she can join the church, she meets Michael Kelly and falls in love. The two get married, start a family, and are wonderfully happy as potato farmers, but when the potato blight hits, it becomes difficult to feed themselves and their children. As the famine continues and the British rulers turn a blind eye to the Irish suffering, Honora must make a choice to either stay in her beloved Ireland or travel to America and the chance for a new life.I have to admit that every time I heard about the potato famine, a part of me asked, \"Why didn't they just eat fish or something else?\" After reading this book, questions like those are no longer in my mind because Mary Pat Kelly does such an amazing job of portraying a typical Irish family during this difficult time. It was like getting a history lesson, only much more interesting than my high school teacher made it. I completely fell in love with Honora and Michael and enjoyed watching their family expand and prosper. When reading about the famine, the author took me through the complete span of emotions, from anger, to joy, to sadness (I actually cried at one point.) Another thing that I loved about this novel was how completely immersed I became in the story, I hated having to put this book down to do something else.

The words \"rich\" and \"lyrical\" would follow. Mary Pat Kelly fully captures the tragedy and triumph of the 19th century Irish emigration. Michael and Honora Kelly, young newlyweds, begin their life together on a small patch of land overlooking Galway Bay. Michael is a bagpiper and blacksmith by trade. He's the owner of a prized racehorse and plans to breed her and sell the colts. Honora's family are hardworking fishermen and she and Michael plant potatoes to feed their family and pay the required rents to their English landlords. The plight of the Irish is well-documented. The English, who came in and took over, tried to do all they could to force the proud Irish people from their lands. Their heartless cruelty comes through, and these strong people resist as long as they can. But, after blight kills the potatoes three times in four years, Michael and Honora finally realize they need to leave Ireland for America.Danger and adventure await them in America as Honora, her sister Maire and their seven sons set forth to find Chicago and Michael's brother, Patrick. The strength of these two women is remarkable and inspiring. Based on the author's great-great-grandmother,Honora's story is one that will captivate you. The Irish people have a strong reputation for storytelling and Galway Bay is the fascinating story of a woman who wants to protect her family and her Irish heritage."}, {"userName": "Pam Brown", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22227810-pam-brown", "userReview": "The Irish have a reputation for story telling, and this book lives up to that reputation. What's truly lovely about this book is that it's based on the true story of the author's own family. The main character was the author's great-great-grandmother. An older cousin who heard many of the stories from the main character herself, passed them on to the author. Then the author filled in with a great amount of her own research.Everybody should learn about the history of Ireland under British rule. Centuries of brutal indifference boggle the mind. The cruelty ranks with The Holocaust, but in slow motion. In just a few years a million people died in The Great Famine of Ireland, and a million more immigrated to America. It's hard to believe the details in this book regarding relief mismanagement and intentional continued hard-heartedness. But even if the details aren't all true, they paint a picture that clarifies Irish-Anglican mutual hatred. Learning the details, and in such a personal context, makes it hard for me to not rail against my English in-laws for a government that maintains Northern Ireland as a last, lingering insult from a people who tried to systematically exterminate another, and in their home land, too."}, {"userName": "Anthony Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2148299-anthony-murphy", "userReview": "This book is a must read for people interested in historical fiction. It is one of the best written books I have ever read and seemed to be realistic, but at the same time remain pretty positive of the whole life experience of Honora Kelly. Yes, some characters in this story do die and other terrible things do happen, but the characters seem to learn and grow from these expereinces instead of being overly haunted by these circumstances. This story also really explains much about the Potato Famine without being too preechy or anti-English. I was really expecting Mary Pat Kelly to really dig it into the English, but she never really did. Alot of people complained about the ending, but I felt that it was actually very happy ending and really thought provoking. The final thing I liked, which I must say that I am biased upon, is the stories and descriptions of Chicago and the Kelly's interactions with my city and some of their most famous residents (Marshall Fields and Comiskey to name a few). I recommend this book to everybody! I loved it fully!

This book was really good, and really disturbing at the same time. It illustrates the strength of love in the face of unimaginable hardship and suffering. And, at the same time, it portrays the lengths we can go to in selfishness and cruelty when we choose to practice exclusion. Eye opening book about a time of horrible famine in history. I am quite sure that my Grandmother, who immigrated to the United States in the early 1900's, would have known the stories of her grandparents experiences of survival thorough these times, but never mentioned them to me. Or perhaps I wasn't listening closely enough. I was a child of the the late 50's, 60's and early 70's. And although we had quite an emotionally tumultuous childhood, by comparison I was living the good life. No concern about where the next meal would come from.

I read a lot of historic fiction books yet never have I read one set in Ireland (w/ the exception of Angela's Ashes) so I found the history of Ireland, The Great Starvation, the treatment of the Irish by the English all very interesting. I never really knew too much about the history of Ireland and the poor reputation the Irish had when they came to the US. It's always interesting to learn about history through fitionalized writing although much of this book is true based on stories passed down through the generations in the author's family. At times I was a little lost with all the Irish names and characters. In hindsight I should have made notes or drawn a family tree. All in all this was a great book.

Interestingly, they came through New Orleans (which I never knew was something that happened with transatlantic immigrants -- I discovered that the term 'The Big Easy\" derives from the fact that big transatlantic ships found it easier to get into the MS Delta than into New York Harbor) and they settled in Chicago. The book finishes up in the 1890s at the dawn of the Irish Independence Movement which got financial backing from Irish already in the US. Really really good story.
