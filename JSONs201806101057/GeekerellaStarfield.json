And an excellent reason for me to stop judging covers because this waaaaay exceeded my expectations from that cover. Live and learn, Cait. LIVE AND LEARN. It was so absolutely heartfelt, that I just...I can't even?? It reminded me of Fangirl all squished with Kindred Spirits and Queens of Geek and I loved it. NERDOM APPRECIATION FOR THE WIN.Now I assume the fandom they were cult following was like a Star Wars spin off? Maybe?? I wouldn't have a clue, not knowing anything about Star Wars except Darth Vadar is someone's father. However, that didn't impede my enjoyment at all. And I think that's something really special about this book: it's just a love letter to fans and geeks of all types. There's no such thing as \"fake fans\" here. There's no fan hating! (Although it does note the \"monster fans\" as Darien calls them, who like will kiss-attack an actor on stage which is 5000% inappropriate for sure and pls stop to those sorts of fans.)I reeeeally loved the Cinderella twist too! The BEST twist was how the \"pumpkin\" was actually a vegan food truck. Like yes please and thank you?! I'm totally here for how quirky that is. The only downside to the retelling twists though, is that the step-mum and sisters were SUCH caricatures and it was really hard to take that part of the story seriously. I really had no feelings about it? It was just bleh bleh I'm not sure why Elle didn't try to get herself out of the situation.I looooved Darien so so much though. He was THE CUTEST DORK. And like he's doing this reboot for a SUPER famous cult-followed show and he loves it, but everyone assumes he's a vapid jerk in for the money. And really he's scared and anxious and having 399 identity crises per day. <3 He was so precious. I also love his and Elle's relationship growing via text. Shoutout to internet friends who aren't axe murders. WE LOVE YOU.I do think their friendship turned to romance a little fast...especially when they only knew each other via text? And hadn't even really talked deeply??? But the book is only like 320 pages. So.I can't even with myself and how many adorakable nerdy contemporaries I'm reading at the moment. I AM USUALLY ALL FOR DRAGON FIRE. But I'm so so so glad I tried this because it just made me so happy! It was deep and there were complex emotions going on there and Darien is the sweetest. And I loved how it underlined that super important message of: pls stop JUDGING PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW. You can never know the full story when you don't know someone. Be kind. Listen. Learn. Also be a geek. The geek life is 500% better."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "[ pretty much all the adults are terrible, the emotional beats could have been stronger, and a major issue with sticking so closely to your source material is that it becomes fairly predictable.

It was a sweet little book about a fandom, some sweet friends, and a retelling of sorts. Elle lives with her jerk of a stepmother and her two daughters. Elle and her father (when he was alive) were big fans of the show, Starfield. They were geek fans together. I love that. But living with the horrible stepmother is not the greatest thing now that Elle's father is dead. Elle works on a food truck and becomes wonderful friends with a really cool girl named, Sage. I fell in love with her once she and Elle started becoming friends. And then there is Franco the dog, his is a whole other tail < -- see what I did =) I love the whole fandom story about Starfield. A lot of people are up in the air about the new guy taking over a main role. His name is Darien. He also has fangirls that are cray. And then there is a cosplay contest. We find out just how sweet it is when some unexpected things happen due to this contest. Overall, it was a feel good little book. A quick read with some lovely characters.

Everyone knows the story of Cinderella, but this modern day retelling feels and was actually able to evoke quite the feelings from me. This is a heartwarming story and if you consider yourself nerdy whatsoever, don't let this book pass you by. I obviously feel confident saying I'm a pretty geeky individual: \u27bd Video Games? I've been raiding for over 10 years in World of Warcraft.\u27bd Esports? League of Legends is my world, and I will not miss NA LCS or LCK for anything. \u27bd D&D? Vox Machina is love, Vox Machina is life. #Critters\u27bd Fandoms? You all know I have that covered. *Explains why Hermione and Draco should have been together*\u27bd Cons? I've embraced and been comfortable with my nerdiness for a while now, but it wasn't always so easy, and this book really struck a chord with me and what I felt like when I was seventeen years old and still unsure of who I was. This book truly felt like my coming of age story, and a book that would have meant everything to me if I would have picked it up when I was younger and needed it. For that alone I will always cherish this story and recommend this book. Never be ashamed of who you are or what you love. Celebrate your passions loudly and unapologetically. Never settle and never listen to anyone who wants you to become something you're not. I promise you, there is someone out there who will love and accept you for who you are and will care about what you love. In the mean time, love yourself and embrace what you love. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m the lost princess. I\u2019m the villain of my story, and the hero. Part of my mom and part of my dad. I am a fact of the universe. The Possible and the Impossible. I am not no one.\u201d\n\n Okay, I promise I'll try to be less emotional. This adorable story starts out like any modern day Cinderella retelling would: with a girl grieving the loss of her father, while trying to put up with her evil stepmother, while dealing with her evil stepsisters. She feels alone and so isolated, while trying to keep the peace and do all the housework and chores for her unloving family. If only there was a way for her to escape.Our Cinderella, Elle, escapes the only way she knows how: in the fandom of the beloved sci-fi show that she shared with her father, Starfield! Starfield is much like a mix of Star Trek and Star Wars, and it just so happens that the show is getting remade into a movie and Elle's favorite character is being played by the most unexpected of male leads. Oh, and Elle also runs a Starfield blog, where she voices her opinion of the casting choices.Meanwhile, this male lead, Darien, is dealing with his own broken home, even though Hollywood makes everything appear perfect on the outside. Even though he's supposed to just be a teen heartthrob, he is secretly obsessed with Starfield and has dreamed of this leading role his whole life. Then, due to a very strange set of events and miscommunication, our two protagonists start texting one another, while being completely unaware of whom they are actually communicating with. \n\n\u201cI hide the phone under my pillow. Because I\u2019m not a princess. And this is the impossible universe, where nothing good ever happens.\u201d\n\nThrow in a cosplay ball, a food truck pumpkin, an amazing friend, and endless geeky references and you have yourself this amazing story wrapped up with helpful discussions and wonderful reminders to love yourself and know your worth. There is also amazing lesbian representation in this book. The story doesn't shy away from it what so ever, and it is treated, as it should be treated, like normal. Again, this book is important, needed, and truly a shining light in 2017 publications. This book was pure joy to read, and I connected with it on a very deep level. This story is truly a love letter to fandoms in general, and it warmed my heart to no end. I was laughing, crying, smiling, and absolutely loving this book from cover to cover. I am so happy a book like this is getting published, and I wish it all the success in the world. \n\n\u201cLook to the stars. Aim.

I loved EVERYTHING about this book. The nerdiness. The cons. The CHARACTERS. Basically it took my favorite things from other Cinderella retellings and wrapped them into one, PLUS EVEN MORE.I love that it's told from dual perspective and tackles (even in passing) issues like \"fake geek girls\" and people not understanding how much you love something that's nerdy and your favorite thing being rebooted or turned into a movie. I didn't love that most of the \"evil\" characters were women (though one was a guy!) but that's kinda cinderella for you.Gosh I cried throughout this book and just felt a lot of it deep in my heart. I love things so deeply and people don't understand and this book took that and was like that's your strength and I JUST I'm getting emotional again probably because I need to sleep.This book was everything to me that's it ok goodnight.Look to the stars.

I'M CRYING RIGHT NOW OF THE FEELS AND I NEVER CRY BECAUSE OF BOOKS! NEVER!This book is perfect. There's no flaw about it! Hence the 5 star rating. It's perfect and relatable and amazing and funny and spectacular and everything I need from a book. This book is for us, geeks. NO ONE WHO ISN'T A GEEK CAN APPRECIATE THIS BOOK THE RIGHT WAY I'M TELLING YOU. No offense to non-geek people but this is a little something for us forever-and-ever geeks.This book is a Cinderella retelling (but could stand out as its own book without the Cinderella influence) about a girl named Ella and her passion for a tv show called \"Starfield\" (which mostly reminds me of Star Trek and I love that) that she shared with her late father. She lives with her evil stepmother (stepMOnster) and her stepsisters who bully her into existence. After a while she finds out about a contest centering the new film reboot of \"Starfield\" and she has to enter but at what cost? I've been a geek my entire life. I don't remember myself not being a geek. From Harry Potter to Star Wars to Doctor Who to Marvel to Lord of the Rings... I've been in fandoms my entire life, I've been reading fan fiction my entire life, I've had OTPs I would die for my entire life, I've been making GIFs for my favorite shows for Tumblr my entire life. This book was a hymn to people like me. This book didn't make me cry because of the romance but because of the nerd culture love it portrayed. It made me feel like I belong in an amazing world not too many people can understand. But the ones that can, know. We all geeks know. The author did an amazing job with making us nerds relate to this book cause she's a nerd herself. And she knows. Like for God's sake this book even contained MEMES. FUCKING MEMES. I live for this book.I'm so happy I got to read this. I'm so happy for these characters. I'm so happy they got what they deserved-happiness. I'm happy for Elle, Darien, Sage, Cal, Gail, Lenny, they were all wonderful. And I'm so grateful to the author for giving this book to us. IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK RIGHT NOW OKAY IT IS. Unless I read another book of hers, or another book about fandom culture and die again. This review is such a mess but I am a mess right now! I would recommend this book a 148394820% to geeks like me, to fandom people like me, to people who know. If you know what I'm talking about throughout this review and if you can understand my feelings for this book then it's for you. Order it, read it and then thank me cause I recommended it this book to you ha!

The horrors of being tied to a stepmom who hates you. The shackles that come along with fame. The tug of the familiar, the nervousness of taking risks. I can't help but fall in love with dreams.In this book we follow two characters, Danielle Wittimer who is the biggest fan of the Starfield series and grew up with it, and Darien a teen actor who just scored the lead role in the remake of the series.Danielle's love for Starfield is sort of violated when the teenage idol, the heartthrob Darien Freeman is casted as the lead in the remake of the original series. She feels like her fandom is violated because Darien comes along with an entire fandom of teenage girls who are in love with him and his looks but not the Starfield fandom, they know nothing about it other than the fact that Darien Freeman is now cast in it. I must say if I was in Elle\u2019s place I would feel the same way and turns out so does everyone else in the original Starfield fandom. The original series wasn't all that popular but it still gathered quite the cult following and these people were like family joined by their mutual love for Starfield and they all felt a surge of rage when Darien and his followers who knew nothing about this amazing series just invaded their sanctuary.But the poor guy however heart stoppingly handsome he is, is just a geek at heart. He does love his fame but for that fame he hides the part of him that knows everything about Starfield and is a fanboy. There's actually a point in the book where his internal monologue is - \u201ddon't fanboy don\u2019t fanboy\u201d, we can all relate to that. I feel the need to mention Darien's appearance on the show Hello America. Elle is watching the show host asking Darien the questions and he answers all of them but misses a question, not because he didn't know the answer but because his script told him to not answer so that he doesn't seem too geeky to the crowd, but as Elle doesn't know that and it increases her initial contempt towards the man who seems to be hijacking her most beloved series. I'm not sure why this incident stuck with me, but watching Darien after the show thinking back to how he hated that he couldn't answer a question he knew the answer to, really touched my heart..Elle\u2019s father started ExcelsiCon a convention for people in fandoms. Once he died Elle was left with a stepmother and two stepsisters who she couldn\u2019t hate more. Watching Elle remember how her stepmother got rid of everything that belonged to her father was so sad and watching her stepmother take advantage of her at every turn, treat her like a slave has my blood boiling.But this time she is not going to abide by the constriction her stepmother set for her. She is going to go to ExcelsiCon and take part in the cosplay event and hopefully win. Darien tries to contact the person who started ExcelsiCon unaware of the fact that he had died and his phone passed on to his daughter, Elle. They start talking to each other via text and start falling in love without ever having met. Darien loves talking to her because with her he doesn\u2019t have to hide his inner geek and can just be who he is.\n\u201dI\u2019m glad to share this sky with you \u2014Maybe we should start looking up together, ah\u2019blena.\u201d\nI understand exactly why their conversations were so dear to each other, they were an escape from each of their lives into a discussion about the story they care about most as neither of them has anyone else to share their love for the fandom. I can't imagine not having someone to go crazy and fangirl with. In fact my best friend is the one who pushed me to read this book because she finished it recently and loved it. She was right, this was an amazing read.As long as you are a reader and a fangirl/boy I feel like this book is right up your alley. The fandom aspect was so perfectly incorporated into the retelling it feels absolutely perfect. This book proves how your fandom can be your family and watching both of the characters find solace in that is heartwarming.Everyone in the fandom are people that understood how supportive characters and stories can be in a person's life. All stories teach us to grow as people and we are constantly learning things from stories we could never have learnt otherwise. They give us hope and they allow us to dream and the people who remain ignorant of the power fiction possesses shall never know the joy that it is to see past reality into worlds that will never exist but will always have a place in our hearts.\n Look to the stars.

The similarities are evident, so if you\u2019ve read that book, this one may not impress you, but still, it is a pleasant read.It\u2019s simply not my kind of read. Well I did enjoy it, because it\u2019s close to impossible for me to dislike a fairytale retelling, though it\u2019s definitely not the type of book I will want to reread in the future. Because I just can\u2019t believe in falling in love through the phone. There are certainly a lot of things you can do through the phone and with your phone, but literally falling in love with someone? Even if it were truly possible \u2013 which I dismiss as a possibility \u2013 I highly dislike the idea of it. You can\u2019t \u2018\u2018be there\u2019\u2019 for someone via your phone. It\u2019s way too easy. \u2018\u2018Being there for someone\u2019\u2019 requires more than you picking up the phone.But I am surprised with how the story unfolded. Having Darien (Prince Charming)\u2019s point of views really brought something to the story. A celebrity falling in love with a common mortal is a bit of a clich\u00e9, but the author made Darien seem so normal that I had no trouble believing it. GEEKERELLA seems like a light, fun read. It has its fun moments \u2013 that\u2019s true \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s a dark, heavy read, but it does deal with loss and loneliness, which means that it\u2019s not rainbows and sunshine everywhere. Basically, I\u2019d recommend it if you\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed CINDER & ELLA, or if you want to read a very contemporary retelling of CINDERELLA.

Yes, please! Seriously, Ashley Poston\u2019s Geekerella has ME written all over it. You\u2019ve got my parents\u2019 hometown (Charleston) combined with a fairy tale retelling (one of my fave subgenres) infused with a fandom-centric plot. Be still my nerdy soul! As fandom becomes increasingly mainstream more books are being published featuring this unique culture. And what\u2019s better, they\u2019re representing it WELL. Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell and Eliza and her Monsters by Francesca Zappia are two recent examples. No longer is fandom considered the domain of the weird and socially inept. Fandom-centric books are bringing forth this formerly insular world and revealing the genius and creativity present within. Since I\u2019m a wee bit older than the standard fangirl, (most of) my IRL friends and/or family never experienced this phenomenon. It was never a thing when they were growing up. So to them fan culture seems obsessive, pointless, and downright WEIRD. How can you possibly be friends with people you\u2019ve never met? But here\u2019s what they don\u2019t understand: fandom friendships can be as genuine and authentic as any real life relationship. The bond created by shared, fevered interests is both intense and immediate. Basically I\u2019m speaking Klingon and the only people who can translate my wacky are my cyber-space compatriots. Geekerella not only gets fandom, it celebrates it. Based on the traditional Cinderella story, Geekerella has all the trappings of the oft-repeated fairy tale but twisted to fit a contemporary setting.  Yes, we have the requisite beleaguered title character tormented by her evil stepmother & stepsisters. But every other classic feature has been realistically adjusted. The prince is actually a movie star, the carriage is a pumpkin-themed food truck, and the famous glass slipper? Cosplay. Geekerella\u2019s strength lies in its creativity. Making what could have been nonsensical, both relevant and applicable. And that relevance extends to our main character\u2019s name, Elle. An orphaned, friendless Elle lives in Charleston\u2019s historic section alongside her stepmother and stepsisters. Tormented daily, Elle is desperate to escape and perceives an upcoming con (for all you fandom virgins, think: comic con) as her ticket out. Elle is a diehard Starfield fan, a classic sci-fi show similarly loved by her late parents. ExcelsiCon features a planned cosplay contest. What\u2019s even better than dressing up as your fave Starfield character? Getting paid to do so. If Elle wins the contest, the prize money will fund a move to Los Angeles. Adios, jerks. This year\u2019s ExcelsiCon is doubly exciting because Darien Freeman, star of the long-awaited Starfield movie, will be present. Soap stud Darien brings with him hoardes of screaming fans drooling over his rockhard abs. But you know who\u2019s not drooling? Elle. She has zero interest in Twilight-ing her favorite show. She wants appreciation and depth. Not Robert Pattinson-esque frenzy. Twihards be damned. To her Darien is a dime a dozen soap hunk with no knowledge or respect for Starfield. A blog post detailing why Darien is a poor casting choice propels Elle\u2019s little side project to stratospheric proportions. And in the midst of the hub-bub? A dismayed Darien. After reading Elle\u2019s harsh criticism Darien, secretly a genuine Starfield fan, contacts ExcelsiCon organizers to cancel his appearance. But you can\u2019t escape fate (or fairy tale magic) because d\u2019ya know who founded ExcelsiCon? Elle\u2019s late father. After Darien\u2019s message is mistakenly forwarded to Elle\u2019s phone, an anonymous relationship via text is formed. Basically, it\u2019s like Cinderella meets Who\u2019s Got Mail. From there the standard Cinderella story ensues. Chapters alternate between Elle and Darien, providing our \u201cPrince Charming\u201d the depth missing from the original fairy tale. Geekerella does a great job of taking the much beloved Cinderella tale and giving it modern flair. We\u2019ve got LGBTQA representation, a heroine with agency paired with a prince that\u2019s a person of color, vlogging, and more. The early text-based relationship between Elle and Darien prevents the story from falling into fairy tale insta-love territory. A solid foundation is formed before these two lovebirds even lock eyes making the story both refreshing and realistic. But while Geekerella is realistic and undoubtedly adorable, there\u2019s nothing groundbreaking to be found. Yes it\u2019s a modern twist, but all the familiar Cinderella plot points remain. It\u2019s predictable. But that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Romantic comedies flourish in part due to their guaranteed happily-ever-after. In a world that\u2019s so unbelievably random, it\u2019s comforting to have something to rely on. Geekerella provides that.To sum up: Geekerella is a modern, romantic-comedy spin on Cinderella. Definitely cute, but not necessarily a stand-out. Early parts dragged a bit and while I appreciated the opportunity to delve into the \u201cPrince\u2019s\u201d story, I found his sections slightly tedious. Thankfully, the story speeds up in the last quarter and at that point you\u2019ll be glued to your seat. Definitely a book I\u2019d recommend to interested parties, but not a priority read.3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Bonnie Shores", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25177308-bonnie-shores", "userReview": "I \nLOVED\n this book soooooooooooo much!!!\ud83d\ude0d I mean, I totally identified with Elle and her devotion to Starfield, the short-lived TV series that spawned a generation of superfans (which is exactly what happened with Star Trek, my first\u2014and still\u2014love).\nI jumped at the opportunity to visit a Star Trek Enterprise replica set and totally geeked out with other fans. (above) I even attended the San Diego ComicCon a couple of years ago and snapped a quick pic with a Captain Kirk wannabe. I, however, remain devoted to Mr. Spock, hence, my blue uniform. Alas, I didn't see a Spock anywhere. Live long and prosper. \ud83d\udd96\nBut I digress... This is the story of Cinderella, ahem, Geekerella, Elle, whose father (and mother) was such a fan of Starfield that he started his own convention, ExcelsiCon, in honor of his favorite show.\n\u201cLook to the stars. Aim. Ignite.\u201d\nElle's dad died, though, when she was only eight years old and she's been living with her stepmother and two stepsisters who defintely don't understand her continued obsession with Starfield.When she receives a phone call from an unknown number asking about ExcelsiCon (which had become huge), she doesn't think much of it. After all, with her dad (and mom) long gone, this is a subject that still causes her heart to break. She had attended the Con with her dad and knew it intimately. She had even danced around her livingroom in her mom's cosplay gown. But those times were over and she was just trying to get through life.Unbeknownst to Elle, the unknown number was Darien Freeman, the teen heartthrob who had been cast as Prince Carmindor in the upcoming Starfield movie. Bored one night, and still trying to get out of his appearance at ExcelsiCon, Darien texts Elle again and thus begins their friendship.I don't want to give anything else away but, obviously, this is a retelling of Cinderella and it follows the same basic story line. Ashley Poston does a fantastic job of updating this beloved tale and putting her own unique and very creative spin on it.This is just the most adorable story and it made me really happy! \ud83d\ude0a"}, {"userName": "Heather 'Bookables'", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5376236-heather-bookables", "userReview": "4.50/5 stars!What an adorable book this was!!!

I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Cinderella as a little girl, I was very little mermaid-y and was determined to live in the sea (thank you mom and dad for not letting this happen\u2026).\u201cMy dad said that the impossible is only impossible if you don\u2019t even try. So I want to try.\u201d Elle I absolutely loved - she was so relatable I thought she was a great main character for a book like this. I loved how much she developed as a character from being this insecure girl who just did as she was told to a strong woman who knew what she wanted as was determined to do it. She was the fangirl that I think everyone of us has inside of us because it was so lovely to see how dedicated she was to the show \u2018Starfield\u2019 and the connection she had with her dad with it is adorable - it actually made me think of me and my dad so that made me really happy. (Shout out to my pops even though he doesn\u2019t see this but he is my number 1 \u2764\ufe0f)Our prince of the story was Darien and I loved him, he didn\u2019t take himself too seriously and was clearly quite new to such fame but deep inside he was just a big nerd who couldn\u2019t believe he was playing the actor from his favourite show in the new remake which was pretty adorable. I found Darien\u2019s POV really fun to read as he was so baffled and surprised by some of his fans and there loyalty to him and he is just super adorable and cute and I loved him.\u201cLook to the stars. Aim.

To start with the writing felt very stilted to me. There was no easy flow. It read quite awkwardly I thought. The main characters in the book all had a sort of pantomime-esque vibe going on that also really didn't work for me. This was supposed to be a contemporary right?? Therefore, you'd think that some realism was required!!! And overall it was just an incredibly unimaginative retelling of a time-honoured classic. It followed the fairytale to a fault and, therefore, instead of breathing new life into the Cinderella storyline, it just felt boringly predictable. Dull dull dull dull!!!!Such a shame. This sounded like it could have been super cute, but that's one of the biggest problems with fairytale retellings I guess. How close do you go to the source material? This one was much too close and then even the slight differences felt jaded... I don't know if anyone else can recall that Hilary Duff teen Cinderella film from the early 2000s: A Cinderella Story. It had that Lucas guy from One Tree Hill in it too... This novel almost felt like fan-fic version of that film to me. I don't know... Maybe Cinderella is just too well known... This book needed a twist. Something to make it stand out. Perhaps something to make it a little grittier and have less of the over-the-top ridiculousness with the characterisations of the main characters. Sadly, as I said before, it was just soooo freaking dull!!!!! Oh I'm probably just too old for this anyway... Time to just forget this and move on to my next read.

Let's put that aside and go into my analytical thinking:\ud83d\udc8a This was cute, I didn't have high expectations but it was cute and I like how the re-telling elements were folded up.\ud83d\udc8a The writing style was mediocre to be honest and the Batman thing was a bit ... annoying?\ud83d\udc8a Much of it was expected and that is logical since it is a re-telling!\ud83d\udc8a I teared up toward the final parts of the book which always make me give a higher rating (See? I am nice) and that is really something! You see, I don't tear in heart-breaking novels such as The sun is also a star, They both die at the end, History is all you left me... etc. I only have happy tears when something good is happening or a character is defending another one; I teared while reading Wonder, Harry Potter, It ends with us and Gangsta Granny!\ud83d\udc8a I could relate to many things, reminded me of Eliza and her monsters although the later was a bit more relate-able!\ud83d\udc8a The Insured abs bothered some readers, but welcome to real world, people do the lamest things and insuring body parts is not unheard of, here is a short list that I found on the internet (not an exhaustive list):Dolly Parton insured her Butt for 600,00$Rihanna insured her legs for 1 million$Madonna breasts are insured for 2 millions $Julia Roberts reportedly insured her smile for $30 millionMariah Carey legs are insured for 1 Billion $ (I don't want to live on this planet anymore too)So, if a character has its abs insured, then I am sorry but C'est la vie!It may have been over-mentioned but I said the writing style is not the best anyway!\ud83d\udc8a It certainly had a message, but then the author keeps roasting bald men, I am against this tbh! you're contradicting yourself even if it is a joke!\ud83d\udc8a I really wanted to make her step-sister behave, she was really fleshed out and as annoying as needed.Anyway, I like to read those fluffy, fast books for a change and I think this delivered what I was looking for so I am being nice and rounding up to 4 stars.New fact about me: I once wrote a Cinderella re-telling before becoming an avid reader!
