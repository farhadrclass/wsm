Not at all.\"Over the past year I've become an avid fan of Gillian French; her writing is so character driven and atmospheric that it takes little to no effort in being transported to the setting of each of her novels. When I first saw the cover reveal for\u00a0The Lies They Tell, I knew I had to get my hands on a copy and I'm so glad I did! This story was a seamless blend of mystery, suspense, and intrigue while also maintaining a traditional \"YA Contemporary\" feel, which is no easy feat. If you enjoy a plot that deals with dark, heavy content while sustaining a lighter, summer read feel, this may be the book for you.As stated above, this is a character driven novel that centers around the past and present; the reader is guided along a thrilling path where both sides of the story are open-ended.\u00a0Who really torched the Garrison estate? Why did Tristan survive? Will Pearl clear her father's name and reinstate his good reputation? How much danger is she really in?\u00a0As the reader we find the answer to all these questions and more, and while I've heard that some people had this one solved from the beginning and others were 100% shocked by the ending, I think I was blissfully somewhere in between. The answer to the whodunnit did cross my mind a few times, but I still felt that I grappled with other solutions and genuinely felt the stun at the big reveal regardless of my prior thoughts.I can't really say more about the plot for fear of spoilers, but if we're being honest my favorite things to talk about here are the characters and atmosphere. I have always dreamed of traveling seaside in Maine, and each time the urge hits me I grab one of two authors-Stephen King and Gillian French. While their writing style and content are on opposite ends of the spectrum, I find they both deliver the setting immaculately in their novels and fill a void in my reading soul that I didn't even know existed before. The writing is lush and descriptive in a natural way; instead of telling you what a summer in Tenney's Harbor is like, she says \"Here, let me show you.\" The characters fit right into this style of writing as well; emotion is conveyed effectively and I felt those moments with Pearl as she experienced innocent, young love with Reese, turmoil over her father's situation, and terror as she realizes who murdered Tristan's entire family.The sign of excellent YA fiction is when it can reach beyond the scope of teenagers and lure in readers of all ages, and the author has given us such an excellent example of this with The Lies They Tell. While a good bit of the middle portion is a slow burn, I believe the patient, character intrigued reader will really take to this growing build up and find themselves gripped from beginning to end. Highly recommended for those looking for a book that's not too dark but not too light over the summer.*Many thanks to the author and publisher for providing me an advance review copy.

Seriously, the first chapter, um, wow\u2014talk about hooking me in right from the beginning. In a town plagued by the uber rich and the working class townies, Tenney\u2019s Harbor, Maine, is a town not unlike other nautical New England towns that have been famously depicted in film and media in the past. I was immediately transported back to my time vacationing in the Hamptons and Rhode Island with this clever story. In Tenney\u2019s Harbor, the uber rich are a tight knit community where competition is key and privilege is currency. The Garrisons are the picture perfect family and have mysteriously has been slaughtered in an arson on the family property. Pearl Haskins, eighteen year old country club server in Tenney\u2019s Harbor, and her father are shamed as gossip and rumors run rampant. Pearl\u2019s father was the caretaker of the Garrison property and is blacklisted in town due to his possible involvement and/or negligence in the Garrison tragedy. Plagued with guilt and embarrassment, Pearl\u2019s father turns to alcohol to mask his pain, while Pearl is angry at the upper class enemy.This summer, Pearl encounters a group of boys at the country club who gravitate towards her. These boys are some of the most privileged in town, and one has taken a liking to her. While Pearl is grossly unattracted to the demeanor exhibited by these boys, she decides to try and get in their inner circle so she can exonerate her father from any wrongdoing accusations by the townsfolk. As Pearl dives into the world of the glitz and glamour, she realizes that everything is not what it seems. With money comes power, and with power comes corruption, betrayal, and deception.\nThe Lies They Tell\n is such a refreshing read for the thriller fan because it\u2019s original, straight-forward, and uncomplicated. We are usually given these stories that have over-the-top in-your-face tricks to attract an audience, but with \nThe Lies They Tell\n we get something more tailored. This story is a slowburn at heart, so please make sure to read this story at the right time, or you may need to put this down and come back to it. I was just off a book hangover from another book and was ready for something light and new. The book is labeled Young Adult, but it doesn\u2019t compare to other Young Adult reads that I\u2019ve read recently because it\u2019s not campy, dry, nor one-dimensional. The characters all have distinct personalities and stories that are stimulating. The ending is very satisfying and also is left for interpretation. I wonder if there will be a book two? *praying to the book Gods because I\u2019m not ready to say goodbye just yet* The story deals with romance, family dynamics, income inequality and privilege, and alcoholism; but the story does not try to wrap this all in one complicated message. We touch on a variety of different subjects, but the main story arc is never lost or deterred. I really enjoyed Gillian French\u2019s nautical spin on a contemporary mystery and am excited for what\u2019s next."}, {"userName": "Amber (Books of Amber)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4354836-amber-books-of-amber", "userReview": "The Lies They Tell was boring.

She lacked personality and I didn\u2019t seem clever enough to solve the mystery. Perhaps Gillian French\u2019s use of third person POV kept the characters being fleshed out.French use of multiple wealthy country club characters, down to their names, outfits and restaurant orders bogged down the story and had me struggling to keep people straight in my mind.

The story does contain an element of mystery , and you can say it's almost in the vein of We Were Liars by E. Lockhart. About six months ago, The Garrisons represented a truly flawed family- there's cheating, bullying and a kind of injustice, before they were all shot and then taken by a fire that killed them inside their home, except for one family member who remained alive. Tristan Garrison, the son. How that happened remains a mystery, throughout which Pearl, the protagonist, continues to gradually unravel puzzle after puzzle, leading her to the discovery of a final unsettling reveal, one that is divulged in the very last pages of the book. The Lies They Tell is quite an entertaining quick read, and the teasingly small insights discovered throughout the book are what makes the read a page-turner. ***Thank you to Gillian French, HarperCollins and Edelweiss for providing me with my copy of The Lies They Tell in exchange for an honest review***You can view more reviews here: www.ludwigsbookreviews.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Thamy", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3555338-thamy", "userReview": "I wasn\u2019t ready for this book. If Pearl wasn\u2019t a teenager and the point of view weren\u2019t all hers, I\u2019d even argue this isn\u2019t YA. I\u2019m always glad when a writer takes her YA seriously.After her father loses most of his jobs thanks to a tragedy happen right under his watch, Pear is working at the club when one of the rich guys seem to take special interest in her. She knows not to fall for their sweet talks, but his friend Tristan, the sole survivor of the tragedy, makes it impossible for her to stay away. Especially when she finally comes across a clue that could finally help unravel the happenings during that day, and who knows recover the trust her father has lost.It took me a while to warm up to Pearl but she is a nice character. I like how she is smart but will still make mistakes, she felt very real in her fascination. What really got me in this story, though, was the atmosphere. It reminds me of some early 2000\u2019s, maybe late 90\u2019s TV series, something like Young Americans meets Gossip Girl meets One Tree Hill? I guess the nostalgia it brought me was what pulled me most while reading this.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s perfect. The mystery itself, while I couldn\u2019t predict it beyond doubt, I can\u2019t say it was that twisty. Even though characters like Tristan could seem mysterious at first, they were just weird after all, which was a little bit of a disappointment. You won\u2019t end this book feeling at awe or anything.Still, this was really good. Gripping, enticing. I felt in my skin the temptation Pearl was under. Sometimes I\u2019d fear Tristan, sometimes I just couldn\u2019t help that weakness in my knees. This is a writer I\u2019m sure to follow from now on.It\u2019s really rare for me to recommend YA\u2019s to other age ranges, but this book could appeal to an older audience.

Someone shot and killed the Garrisons, then setting fire to their home. The only remaining Garrison was 17 year-old Tristan.As if the murder itself wasn't shock enough to the town, Pearl Haskin's family is effected by the murder in a way that turns their world upside down. Her father, who works as a caretaker for the expensive properties of the summer folk, was working for the Garrisons on the night of the fire, and therefore had to bear the brunt of speculation and police questioning. Ultimately, Win Haskin lost all of his current jobs and recommendations, leaving their family in a financial hole and pushing him toward the bottle.But it's that time of year again and the 'boys of summer' are returning to their vacation homes. When Tristan and his pose of polo-clad pals start attending meals at the clubhouse where Pearl works, she starts to slowly integrate herself into their lives.How much information can Pearl find out?

While the mystery of the Garrison murder is always just below the surface and the ultimate priority of Pearl's every move, the plot is very much character driven. We learn so much about not only Pearl and her family, but also about Tristan and his closest friends--Bridges and Akil. There are also several female characters that are originally perceived as very snooty and annoying (in my opinion.. as many 'popular' girls that age can come across), but throughout the novel you learn pieces of their own stories that make them have more depth and character.Pearl will break you heart and will elicit so much respect from you for a girl of her age. At only 18-years-old, she has very much become the glue that holds her household together. Her father has spiraled down the drain after losing employment due to the Garrison case. He is very much struggling from alcoholism and has a very depressive outlook on life right now. Pearl becomes his caretaker and demonstrates a very strong work ethic for a teenager.There is romance in this novel, but it is never the front-runner in the plot. Pearl experiences heartbreak and jealousy through a relationship with her best friend Reese and begins a slow-burning romance with one of Tristan's best friends (as well as a very odd/mysterious relationship with Tristan himself).The pacing was very slow, but I felt that was appropriate for the target age group for this novel (marketed for grades 9+). I am used to reading lots of police procedurals and crime thrillers, so I kept wanting to investigate more into the deaths of the Garrisons. But that is exactly what Pearl is doing--to the extent that an 18 year-old is able to do so. She literally Trojan Horses herself into this group of prestigious and arrogant boys in order to gain access to any information they might have in relation to the Garrison murder.Overall, I really enjoyed this title! It was very nostalgic--we can all remember what it was like to be 18--young and free, but with so many burdens that seem beyond our control. Pearl is a strong female lead in that she does not stand back and let these burdens overtake her family. She is determined and headstrong and does what she has to do to protect her father (and her family).Trigger Warning(s): Murder, Fire, Alcoholism, Child Abuse, Insinuated Sexual AssaultThank you to Gillian French & HarperTeen for providing me with an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.\u00a0Off The Press Reads: Blog \u2605 Instagram \u2605 Bloglovin'"}, {"userName": "Danielle (Life of a Literary Nerd)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32803116-danielle-life-of-a-literary-nerd", "userReview": "I actually really wanted to like this more than I did.

I love mysteries, and while this book was not getting the best reviews, I still held out hope. Now that I've finished the book, however, I feel that I should have listened to the reviews, as The Lies They Tell unfortunately was not the book for me. The Lies They Tell falls into the 'meh' category. I didn't love it nor did I hate it; instead, it was just kind of there. I had no problem finishing it, as I wanted to know how it ended, but at the same time, I never became hooked or felt a wave of emotions. The Lies They Tell focuses on Pearl, a recent high school graduate who has spent summers catering to the needs of her town's elite. There wasn't much to Pearl. She wasn't incredibly interesting, and I never felt that she was the strongest character. I didn't like how she was so willing to throw her true friendships aside, and I also felt that she was incredibly indecisive. Sometimes I felt as if she was aiming to prove Tristan was the culprit while other times I felt as if she wanted nothing more than to shield him from the world. She brought that level of indecisiveness to all her relationships, particularly with the boys. Tristan, Reese, and Bridges...they all seemed to blend together. I was never fully behind her relationship with Bridges - they was never a true connection there - and her unrequited love with Reese became too much over time. There were so many times that everything with Reese could have been solved with a simple conversation, but Pearl was never willing to take it to that level. I also didn't like how she was so quick to throw him to the side...The synopsis stresses a twisted mystery, but it took a long time to get to that mystery, and even then it wasn't the most gripping one out there. I could see the culprit coming from miles away. I wanted more suspense, more sleuthing, more clues. I liked the times at which she teamed up with Reese to look for clues, but those times were slim. Instead of focusing the mystery, The Lies They Tell focused on the divide between the rich and the poor of the town. In some ways, I liked that topic - it was interesting to see how the town's people interacted, how their was such a great divide - but at the same time, I never felt that Gillian could have taken it further. There were so many more things that could have been said regarding the video, the jobs, etc. In all, The Lies They Tell never managed to truly 'wow' me due to a variety of reasons. Fans of slower paced reads may enjoy it; however, if you're looking for a fast paced mystery, this probably won't be the book for you. *ARC was provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review* Book Blog | Twitter |  Bloglovin |  Goodreads"}, {"userName": "Diana Iozzia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66291103-diana-iozzia", "userReview": "\u201cThe Lies They Tell\u201dWritten by Gillian FrenchReview written by Diana Iozzia of Bookworm Banter \u201cThe Lies They Tell\u201d follows our main protagonist, Pearl Haskins, as she discovers the mystery of why the house of one of the richest families in town has burned to the ground. Nearly all of the Garrison family perished, except their eighteen-year-old son, Tristan. Pearl is stuck in a love triangle, or square, I guess, as she tries to help her father and his alcoholism. Pearl works as a waitress at a country club during the summer, still planning her way out of the town to college in the fall. Pearl befriends a group of rich kids from the club, soon starting to fall for Bridges and Tristan, while still sort of pining for her co-worker, Reese. This book reminds me of 90210 meets \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d by Truman Capote. Who killed the Garrisons? Was it their surviving son? Was it Pearl\u2019s father, who was there working as the caretaker that night? Could it have been someone else entirely? I enjoyed some of this book, but not much. I think I would have enjoyed this more if I was younger. As a twenty-two-year-old, sometimes it can be difficult for me to get into the mindset of a teen to read young adult fiction. Most of the characters, barring Bridges, were a little too unrealistic for me. I really enjoyed the dialogue, it is very realistic and representative of teens. Often in young adult fiction, we\u2019re \u201ctreated\u201d to talk of Facebook and Snapchat and Instagram and Kim Kardashian, so it was nice to have a break from \u201cteens\u201d. There\u2019s a bit of uncomfortable sexual harassment in this book, but the characters did call out the harassment which I appreciated. As for the alcoholic father premise, this pops up in too many teen fiction novels. I\u2019m tired of the teens having to be responsible and fix their parents. The names are very glamorous and of course make sense for the novel. Bridges, Tristan, Hadley, Quinn. They all sound a bit like the author researched wealthy teen names. There were scenes that I enjoyed. I enjoyed the boat sailing scenes, because it offered a new location / setting that\u2019s not often incorporated into teen fiction. I felt a little \u201cTalented Mr. Ripley\u201d in some parts, which I liked. The climax and the reveal behind the murders was good, but I don\u2019t think it was a shocking enough plot twist that made the book feel worthwhile. The book is slowly paced, and I don\u2019t mind a slow paced book if it eventually builds to a fantastic reveal, with great little tidbits in the middle. I recommend it for teens, but if you\u2019re above the age of 20, perhaps this book may be a little too young for you.I received an advanced review copy for my honest reviewing purposes."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328615-lindsay", "userReview": "Pearl lives in a small, oceanside Maine town where there is a fine line between the rich and poor. She is part of the latter and works at the town\u2019s country club along with her dad. Six months earlier, four out of five Garrison\u2019s (one of the rich families who live on Millionaire Row) were shot in their sleep and their house was set ablaze. Pearl\u2019s father was on duty that night and didn\u2019t see anything suspicious until he smelled the flames, and by then it was too late to save the family. Now he is blamed for not seeing the intruder and not saving the family and on top of that many rich people think he was the one to set fire.Tristian is the sole survivor of the Garrison family. He was hours away in the mountains when his family was murdered. Now he is back in town for the summer with his two BFFs and they typically dine at the country club. Tristian\u2019s BFF Bridges suddenly becomes enamored by Pearl and asks her out. Pearl says yes even though she hates rich people. She has her own secret agenda to solve the murder and proclaim her drunk father\u2019s innocence. Pearl and Bridges venture to parties and go on boat rides. Then Pearl\u2019s BFF Reese (whom she is crushing on) realizes that Pearl is hanging with Tristian\u2019s posse and shuns her for a good portion of the book. Let\u2019s not forget that all these characters are over eighteen and have every right to choose who they want to hang out with.Pearl works at the country club, hangs out with Bridges, is ignored by Reese, babies her drunk father, plays on her tablet, and oh yeah, stalks Tristian a lot. One night during a party at the club, Tristian, Bridges, Akil (Tristian\u2019s other BFF), Hadley (Bridge\u2019s ex-girlfriend), and Pearl go on a boat ride to caves in the middle of the Atlantic. The boys dutifully turn off the lanterns and leave the girls to fend for themselves in these mysterious caves while the tide rises. We learn that Cassidy (Tristian\u2019s deceased sister) was cheating on her boyfriend Akil with Bridges while Bridges was cheating on Hadley with Cassidy. Then we find out who killed the family.This was very bland and slow paced. No action or suspense or mystery. I don\u2019t like third person narrative and this book would be an example why. There were too many characters to keep track of and everything was described and told so tediously. For example, Pearl\u2019s semi-nemesis is her coworker Indigo since Reese and her sometimes hookup. When Reese and Pearl drive to Indigo\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house to inquire about the Garrisons, there are random long details about what Indigo looked like in pictures hanging up in the house and the attire she had on. Why would we need to know this? The sole purpose of going there was to obtain information, not focus on pictures of a character that is hardly part of the story. Indigo\u2019s only purpose was to provide friction between her and Reese since Reese chose Indigo and not Pearl. The timeline moved at a snail\u2019s pace with repetition regarding Pearl working, parenting her dad, and chilling with her tablet. Kind of like Bella\u2019s life in Twilight regarding how she always made her father dinner every single night. The killer was predictable and then the story abruptly ended.I received an ARC of The Lies They Tell from Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5692732-ashley", "userReview": "Easy to read and not that long.

What a ride this book was! If you've been following me here, on Instagram or on Goodreads than you already know I'm a fan of Gillian's writing. I've read her last two books Grit and The Door To January, both of which came out in 2017 and I loved them both! Naturally when Gillian asked if I would be interested in reading and reviewing her newest book, The Lies They Tell, I didn't hesitate to say yes. I knew I would I wouldn't be disappointed reading another one of her Maine centered mysteries and I definitely wasn't. Fierce, mysterious and paranoia inducing, The Lies They Tell is one book you won't want to put down until the very end.What first struck me about this book is that there's no denying that Gillian is a Maine native (like myself). She paints such a vivid and perfect picture of the locations the characters travel that I truly felt like I was being transported there, which honestly wouldn't be hard since I live quite close to the area this story takes place in. She's solidly describes the relationships between the true, blue Mainers and the Summer people, aka the wealthy. There's a line drawn, which to some could seem as overdone or unrealistic, but I'm here to tell you that Gillian writes the divide EXACTLY how it is in real life. I found myself relating so much to Pearl, in the way of her job, living and all over station in life, because that's the way life can be for so many off us in our rural little state. What I really loved though, was that it wasn't painted as a bad life, just a tough moment in time, giving hope and the drive to work toward a better future.The characters, man, I don't think I've ever been so stressed out about a group of teenagers in my life. AGH! There were so many great characters and so many awful characters and I didn't know who to trust and I felt like I liked the wrong people...ugh. See what I mean about stress? Really though, Pearl, our main character is excellent. She impressed me so many times with her calm demeanor, her wits and her responsibility, and when Pearl came into the group of the \"Summer Boys\" Tristan, Bridges and Akil, it made me like her even more. Pearl found her own way into the group of the Summer kids and navigated them like a pro, with a few exceptions. She didn't put up with their crap and ultimately she shared her compassion, causing the boys to open their eyes a little wider. The boys themselves were an interesting crew, I didn't know what to think of Tristan the whole time, I mostly just pitied him, but I loved Bridges, I thought he was a sweetie pie. Akil....meh. Throughout, all of the characters in this book are compelling, you want to know everything about them, all the drama, yet you don't dare trust them, because any of them could be the one that killed the Garrison's. I feel like I would be remiss to leave out the ladies after mentioning the guys. Both Quinn and Indigo are secondary characters, that I feel like we're not exactly supposed to like, but I did. They're both so strong and don't put up with any shit. We absolutely need more ladies like this in young adult literature.The mystery aspect of this book was SO GREAT. So great! I seriously had no idea who did what until the very end and I was flabbergasted. The few clues you're given during the story are so slight that you won't even catch them until it's too late. While that part of it was great, I did feel like the big reveal happened a little too quickly. I didn't feel like I got enough answers or enough closure, so I felt like I was floundering a bit at the end. Basically, I need more!The one thing I will say that I REALLY didn't like about this book was Pearl's relationship with her best friend/love interest Reese. Actually, the thing I really didn't like about this book was Reese. I don't want to get into too much detail (spoilers), but UGH. That guy is the worst. Maybe it's just me, but a badass, independent lady like Pearl can do so much better than a guy like that. If you've read the book you'll have to let me know your thoughts on him.Overall, I really loved The Lies They Tell. I think it gives us a powerful look into teen life, the divide between wealthy and everyone else, and gives us a dark look into how someone can completely surprise you by what's going on in their head. If you like teen angst, drama and a whodunit, I highly recommend this book.4 out of 5 stars.Also, a big HAPPY BOOK BIRTHDAY to The Lies They Tell! It was just released today, so if this sounds appealing to you, RUN to the bookstore, don't walk.Many thanks to HarperCollins for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The very label leaves loads of room for variance and interpretation. And while there are those who look down their nose at YA fiction, the reality is that there\u2019s plenty of nuance and sophistication to the best work in the genre.Maine author Gillian French\u2019s work definitely demonstrates those qualities; her latest is \u201cThe Lies They Tell,\u201d a thriller featuring a young woman trying to get to the bottom of a tragic mystery that haunts her small island town. Secrets and lies abound even as the dynamics between the town\u2019s wealthy summer visitors and the year-round residents who serve them grow complicated.The town of Tenney\u2019s Harbor on Maine\u2019s Mount Desert Island has been a summer playground for the wealthy for generations. As with any such community, the relationship between those rich summer folks and those who live there year-round is delicate. That delicacy is laid bare one December when the Harrison family \u2013 one of the stalwart summer families, in town for a surprise holiday visit \u2013 is trapped in a horrible fire. Patriarch David, his wife Sloane, 17-year-old piano prodigy Cassidy and 10-year-old Joe all die. The family\u2019s sole survivor \u2013 and sole heir \u2013 is teenaged Tristan.Pearl Haskins has lived in Tenney\u2019s Harbor her whole life. She works at the local country club, serving meals and drinks to the monied elite that wanders into town to idly while away the summer months. Her father was on watch the night of the fire \u2013 whispers of his culpability for what happened are a constant, costing him the caretaking work that was their livelihood. He seeks solace at the bottom of a bottle.Pearl keeps her head down, working toward college and pining for a romantic relationship with her best friend Reese. But when Bridges Spencer, teen grandson of one of the town\u2019s most prominent summer residents, takes an interest in her, she finds herself suddenly moving in a vastly different orbit than anything she has experienced before. That orbit includes Tristan, whose melancholy grief is accentuated by the shadow of suspicion that hovers over him.Pearl is drawn to Tristan, to the power he seems to hold over Bridges and the rest of the youthful scions of wealth that summer in Tenney\u2019s Harbor. But as she spends more time in that sphere, she finds herself wondering just what might have happened that snowy winter night. The truth is there to be found, if only she can uncover it. That truth could potentially exonerate her father, assuage his guilt \u2026 and put to rest the sad, despondent ghosts that haunt not just the Haskins family, but the entire town.It would be a grave mistake to dismiss \u201cThe Lies They Tell\u201d as merely YA fiction. This book isn\u2019t \u201cmerely\u201d anything \u2013 French is a gifted writer, a prose stylist who refuses to condescend to her targeted audience. She has written a taut, engaging thriller, one unafraid to take its time. Nothing is rushed; there are no half-measures or shortcuts taken. She allows the narrative to play out precisely as it needs to; that lack of pressure results in a gripping mystery that never once feels forced or false.One of the book\u2019s biggest strengths comes from its understanding of the class dynamic inherent to a town divided between summer residents and full-timers. The ecosystem of a place like MDI is a deeply complex one, packed full of eccentricities borne of time measured in generations \u2013 families serving families rather than individuals serving individuals. French really captures the passive aggression and antagonism that are the inevitable result of such a skewed distribution of power. That skewed spirit is apparent on every page of \u201cThe Lies They Tell.\u201dPearl is a well-realized character, an apt representative of the \u201ctownie\u201d who has inadvertently stumbled into a realm she had heretofore only observed from afar. The population of Tenney\u2019s Harbor is split between those who view it as a getaway \u2013 Tristan, Bridges, the rest of the entitled teens and their parents \u2013 and those who view it as home \u2013 Pearl, Reese, Pearl\u2019s dad and so on. Defining that split is key to the narrative\u2019s compelling foundation.The mystery carries forward with an enigmatic energy; French leaves bread crumbs to be followed while still leaving the reader room to make their own discoveries. The end \u2013 when it comes \u2013 comes quickly; while some might argue that the closure is too abrupt, French has constructed the narrative in such a way that the pacing of that ending is just right.\u201cThe Lies They Tell\u201d is a well-constructed, well-written thriller. Yes, Gillian French writes YA fiction, but one needn\u2019t be a young adult to engage with her work. The quality of the work, the execution of it \u2026 while it might be intended for teenage readers, it will entertain and engage an audience of any age."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4854607-jennifer", "userReview": "[some kind of shining A-HA or WOW moment with Indigo\u2019s (probable) video participation.

While I found it to be an interesting read overall, the story was missing that excitement to truly grab me throughout.The Lies They Tell had a strong beginning, initially quite engaging as we meet the Garrison\u2019s while Pearl waits on the family, minus the one, only for them to be murdered later on that night. I was left quite anxious to dive into the story after that. The main story takes place about 6 months later as we see the devastation the murders has caused. Pearl is still a waitress at a country club in a Maine tourist town, waiting on the rich while her family struggles to survive. The tragic event caused her father to not only lose work as he was there that night and people seem to blame him for not stopping the events that unfolded, but also started his downward spiral further and further down the hole of alcoholism as he dealt with his own demons and guilt. When the last surviving Garrison, Tristan, shows up at one of her tables along with his friends, Pearl is drawn to him and the answers waiting to be discovered, but finds herself getting in over her head as she does.One of my favorites parts of the novel was Pearl\u2019s motivation. She has taken on a lot of responsibility in her household, way more than a young girl should. She is working to help pay the bills piling up and she is trying to help an alcoholic who is only getting worse. She feels like if the murders were solved, perhaps the town would stop shaming her father and he could get back some of the work he has lost and he could begin to heal. She situates herself in Tristan\u2019s group, sort of developing a little romance with one of his friends, Bridges, though I\u2019m not sure how much of a romance you could call it because she was so fascinated with Tristan and then there was her best friend who she harbored feelings for as well. I didn\u2019t like almost everyone, including Pearl\u2019s best friend/crush. Really I felt like all the characters were sort of kept at arm\u2019s length and it was probably done to drum up suspicion in everyone we meet but it also made them feel quite lackluster in a way.As for the crime solving, I needed more from it. It desperately needed more excitement and suspense, and perhaps a few more solid suspects to add to the overall mystery. I don\u2019t always mind predictability as the reader as long as the getting there and details are fun to unravel but that was missing here.On a whole, I liked this book okay enough. Perhaps if it had a bit more oomph at the end I would have enjoyed it more. It\u2019s a pretty quick read and I believe this storyline will appeal to many readers."}, {"userName": "Lisa (Remarkablylisa)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25767195-lisa-remarkablylisa", "userReview": "MY RATING: 2/5 STARSI received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.I received this book in a goodies bag from the publisher and thought that why I normally don't reach for a YA thriller or a thriller in general, it wouldn't hurt to give a book a try. The Lies They Tell by Gillian French start off the same way a typical thriller starts. It's a slow build up with an air of mystery floating through the pages. A wealthy and successful and seemingly happy family are murdered in their beds. Their lovely home is set ablaze and their bodies are turned to ashes. Everyone is dead except for the eldest son or the black sheep in the family because he is sent faraway in another state to rethink his poor decisions.It's a pretty chilling tale already.Our main girl, Pearl, is a quirky chick. She's the cool punk rock girl that isn't afraid to stare you down in the hallways until you look away first and she has no issue with attracting the attention of boys. Her father just so happens to be the security guard who was on patrol during the accident that shocked the tourist town. Pearl's father claims he never drank during his shift. After her mother split with her father, he's been swept up in grief and depression and looked towards the bottle for happiness. Already, we have an unreliable suspect.Pearl finds herself being invited to the super rich and cool kids parties and hangouts. She gets closer to Tristan, the eldest son that survived and finds him a little...off. To be really honest, I got the whole American Psycho vibe from him as I reading it but I also read a lot of weird stuff and I thought Tristan and Pearl would end up together.ANYWAYS.This book was slow. And unfortunately, it continued to be slow. And worst of all, predictable. It's so obvious. It was majorly disappointing too because as I was halfway through the book I was like, yup. It's him. No doubt. Stop with the red herrings and the fancy backstories that shock us a bit but not too much because I know the guy that was responsible for these deaths and I can bet you would know too if you pick this up.MY RECOMMENDATIONPick a different thriller. This one just wasn't for me."}], "description": "With shades of E. Lockhart\u2019s We Were Liars and Gayle Forman\u2019s I Was Here, this dark and twisted mystery will be the page-turner of the year.Everyone in Tenney\u2019s Harbor, Maine, knows about the Garrison tragedy. How an unexplained fire ravaged their house, killing four of the five family members. But what people don\u2019t know is who did it. All fingers point at Pearl Haskins\u2019s father, the town drunk, who was the caretaker of the property, but she just can\u2019t believe it. Leave it to a town of rich people to blame \u201cthe help.\u201dWith her disgraced father now trying to find work in between booze benders, Pearl\u2019s future doesn\u2019t hold much more than waiting tables at the local country club, where the wealthy come to flaunt their money and spread their gossip. This year, Tristan, the last surviving Garrison, and his group of affluent and arrogant friends have made a point of sitting in Pearl\u2019s section. Though she\u2019s repulsed by most of them, Tristan\u2019s quiet sadness and somber demeanor have her rethinking her judgments. Befriending the boys could mean getting closer to the truth, clearing her father\u2019s name, and giving Tristan the closure he seems to be searching for. But it could also trap Pearl in a sinister web of secrets, lies, and betrayals that, once untangled, will leave no life unchanged . . . if it doesn\u2019t take hers first.", "title": "The Lies They Tell", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35887572-the-lies-they-tell", "average": 3.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508348896l/35887572.jpg", "reviews": 85, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13539527.Gillian_French", "name": "Gillian French"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13539527.Gillian_French", "name": "Gillian French"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Young Adult", "Contemporary", "Thriller", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35887572-the-lies-they-tell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068658-the-lies-they-tell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36643462-the-lies-they-tell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31706530-grit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31017998-the-door-to-january", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39937609-the-missing-season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35989477-weirdbook-36", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25742603-sanitarium-030"]}
