The story is fast paced but that seems to be primarily because of the same formula used over and over, event happens, shoot their way out, lose two people and onto the next catastrophe. Character development is non existent.Overall these books seem to consist of a constant litany of the same formula in which these \"super soldiers\" seem to resemble Hogans Heroes.I gave up."}, {"userName": "Timothy Haas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7564216-timothy-haas", "userReview": "This book is well written and fast paced.

I have to say first that I'm not a big fan of zombie books, movies, TV shows, etc. I feel they're very limited & this series proves that for me. First off, there is no character development at all. There is not one stand out character & you can swap the characters around & it wouldn't make a difference. Two books of generic military guys spouting military quotes & killing zombies.I find the books are just scene after scene of generic zombie action. Throw in some movie quotes & references & we get something that we've read & seen before. I found myself not knowing if I was reading the same parts over & over, or whether I was actually reading ahead, through the book.This all being said, I find the books are well written, especially with it's military knowledge. The settings are well described & you can really see in your mind's eye what is going on. I have the third book, but do not know if I'm going to bother with it. I'm sure it's going to be the same stuff as these first two. I get it."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Robbins", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7571555-jeffrey-robbins", "userReview": "That books was WAY too short.

It is the start of a rollercoaster ride that you never want to get off...The USS John F Kennedy is taking Alpha Team towards the coast of the infected USA but one of the Team is becoming concerned about the intentions of a group of religious zealots on the ship. The distracted ship XO is too busy getting Alpha team and their back up ready to go to give it much thought. The rest of the Team are more concerned about how bad their mission is going to be as they get closer to the target and prepare to go into Chicago. Back in Hereford, Echo Team arrive home with a wounded man who they say has been shot...This is the book where things really start to happen and we break off into different groups of characters involved in life threatening scenarios, all happening in different places but at the same time. The tension just ramps up as we move from one group to another, caught up in the various disasters as they unfold, and it is just so well written that I couldn't put the book down. There is no respite for the poor reader as we worry about all of our favourite characters! Here is a taster of what you can expect:The media are excited at the rescue of the Channel Tunnel survivors and are interviewing them at Folkestone while at the Hereford base, medical officer Lt Col Bryan watches as an injured man is brought in from Echo team's mission with a suspected gunshot wound. Bryan orders him to be isolated and restrained as a precaution, however, everyone is distracted when a warhead on a damaged helicopter accidently hits the mess hall and chaos erupts on the base. And that is when the alarms are going off and the screaming and moaning starts...On the USS John F Kennedy, Wesley and Martin are wondering about the safety of Britain and what happened to the Foxtrot that caused so much damage. Homer reports to Drake, the XO, that religious zealots on the ship are claiming that the zombies are doing God's work and the soldiers are stopping the Rapture that will save the faithful. He knows that these men have weapons and Homer is concerned for the safety of the ship and everyone on it. The religious leader Carson knows there is a zombie quarantined on the ship and he is now coming up with a plan to bring about Rapture by setting it free amongst the sleeping soldiers to distract them while his people take the ship. Drake is going to wish he had listened to Homer's warnings when the biting and fighting begins...Alpha Team are being inserted into Chicago but poor weather turns the landing into a nightmare when only four of them manage to land on the target building. Predator crashes into the roof of another building and Juice detours to try and go to his assistance. Ali is blown way off course and headed for the street and Homer breaks every rule in the book to go after her. The team are scattered and surrounded by zombies on all sides, with communications to the ship down and no immediate chance of rescue, and staying alive and finding each other now takes priority before they can even think about the mission.Oh this book was exciting! On the ship we get the deliberate terror attack using a zombie, which causes an outbreak. To make things more difficult for the crew, they are also trying to fight the religious zealots who are trying to take over the ship. It gives great confused scenes of men fighting zealots, men fighting zombies, zombies attacking men and zealots, and in the middle of the chaos a rescue plane is being scambled to go and retrieve Alpha squad. I was worried about the safety of Drake, Wesley, Martin and Fick as the battle raged around them. It was total chaos and you get a real sense of how quickly things are moving out of control for Drake.The plot was switching from the chaos on the ship to the zombie outbreak at Hereford then straight onto Alpha Team and their mission into hell so the action just never let up. I don't want to go into any detail about what happens to Alpha on the ground in Chicago but the book is called Mogadishu of the dead for a reason and the mass of zombies continually attacking them as they try to find a way to the scientists and then get out of the city are truly nerve shredding. I felt as if I was there with Alpha as they encountered one problem after another. I didn't know what to expect each time I turned the page and you can't ask for anything better than that.This was a brilliant zombie book. I loved that it was character driven and we really start to get to know the main players on the ship and within Alpha Team, which does get you more invested in the plot. The plot was just sucking me in with every page I read full of excitement, danger and tension. I know I'm gushing a bit but this is looking like one of the best series I have ever read and it's only book two! Definitely recommended for all zombie fans."}, {"userName": "Angela Verdenius", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11378467-angela-verdenius", "userReview": "Such an amazing series! A large group of people in different areas, each fighting to save others. It's nice to read of people working together instead of screaming at each other and disobeying orders, having idiot commanders, etc. The characters aren't perfect, but I'd be glad to have them on my side in a zombie apocalypse!

I have read both Arisen : Genesis & Arisen, Book One - Fortress Britain and gave them BOTH 5-Star reviews, as I will this one. I remarked that the Arisen series appears to be written just for me, but I have never met either author. I am a fan of Michael Stephen Fuchs, mainly due to his hi-tech special ops thrillers: D-Boys & Counter-Assault (D-Boys #2). I am an action, zombie, thriller, & special ops junkie and these thrillers are PERFECT in those regards. I cannot wait for the 3rd book to come out, it should be due any day now. Genesis is the prequel to the series. Also, just to let you know, I did not receive this book free, but paid for it the DAY it came out.********These authors have written a very well put together thriller and have managed to set the story in 3 different locations: on the aircraft carrier the JFK, in Great Britain, and in Chicago, without confusing us readers. I want to know about what is going on in all 3 locations. The world they are painting is very bleak indeed and almost appears hopeless. Yet our heroes press on. The specical force operators (from the U.S. and Britain) are not cardboard sterotypes. No, these guys/gals come across as deeply committed with many personnel issues as we would expect, such as: family concerns, religious beliefs, death issues, and so on.I have read some other special forces/action thrillers recently (and please, check out my reviews, to see what types of books I have read and enjoyed) that claim to be action oriented and then I discover they are either poorly written or are really romance books pretending to be action. The characters in the Arisen books have feelings, but no sappy romances.........And these books are very well written (as I mentioned before). Glynn and Michael: please keep the Arisen series coming..........I would subscribe to this series if that option was available."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9128249-matt", "userReview": "4.5/5Like the first installment, this series of military-action/zombie-survival novellas are easy page turners. The characters each have their own personality and an effort is made to make them a bit three-dimensional. The action is smooth, the third person omniscient is sometimes a little convenient for telling us about a situation rather than showing us, but all in all -- This series is just as entertaining as the Walking Dead. For the less enthusiastic, I complete see why an argument could be made for a 3 Star. The writing is nothing special.But the plot? The action? That's what this book is all about.This is not literary. This is a rollicking, pulpy, zombie series, and could be made into a comic, a show, a movie, or even a radio drama with ease. My only complaint is that each of the ebooks are barely 120 pages, but that can be viewed as a strength. For an ebook exclusive, it's great for \"lesser known\" authors. You have five or six, cheap installments, each building off the previous with it's own beginning middle and end, plus new b-stories. They feel good, but you have to read them in order, and you have to read them all to get the complete story.I can see why some take issue with the fact that none of the books feel \"whole.\" They can't really stand on their own because they always feel \"incomplete\" like the way the end of a great season of Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad or Walking Dead makes you feel. But that's just how it is. That's how these books were written. So once you finish the first one, you have to ask yourself, do I want to read four more to finish this story? Am I that interested to dedicate myself?My answer was hell yes.4.5/5MH"}, {"userName": "Chris Catania", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33334232-chris-catania", "userReview": "I read Nemesis (prequel) and then Fortress Britain (first book of series), I like both these books. They were smart and action packed. Then i started this book, not smart beyond stupid. People 2 yrs into ZA doing the stupidest stuff possible to get killed and then killing their friends. Also the story stopped being about the missions to stop the Zs and started being about numerous stupid side stories. The female SOP sleeps with another and worries about dooming the mission because of it. A guy secretly stored a zombie below deck in the carrier starts a cult of zombie (with command mostly aware of it) that thinks Zombie are God's plan to cleanse the earth and they release it mid voyage. A wounded in isolation turns, infects a nurse and they miraculously get out of isolation to infect the entire hospital that takes an air strike to stop. 2 guys walking sentry on the suspected main weakness to zombie infiltration via chunnel to france get sloppy turned and the supervisor has a one shot shotgun and a radio that doesn't work. Stupid unbelievable stuff over and over with barely any more of the main story of SOP missions to try to stop the plague. Did i mention this is 2 yrs after ZA take out most of the world, which makes all the stupid stuff utterly unbelievable.

This goes well beyond the Walking Dead for action as Fortress Britain, the only country left standing, is trying to reset the world to being zombie free. The missions are many and the action is hot as American and British military conduct missions across the globe trying to find materials and people in a race to stop the extinction of the human race.There are many characters in this saga and yet the author develops them with depth and reality. The protagonists and the antagonists seem to be so real, as does the action. Reading this saga pulls you in and places you in the middle of the action.

The combination is succesful due to the two authors traditionally specialising in one of the respective genres meaning a rich blend of expertise. The fail points of ebook series is often the obvious breakup of one story into parts for no other purpose but to generate revenue for the independent author, however thats not the case so far in the Arisen series with the authors succesfully delivering an overarching plot with exciting and relevant subplots that start and finish with the appropriate peaks within individual ebooks.

It was interesting what they did with focusing on different characters through different books rather than follow the same characters throughout the series. Wile the authors' attention to detail and consistency is admirable, the military lingo was a bit much for my liking, as I regularly had to use the dictionary/wikipedia app to find out exactly what they were speaking about. Too many mistakes on the part of some characters...especially the military.

As I said before, I'm not really into zombies, but the first book really caught my imagination.The first book had built the story up to a superb point and handed it over to this book at a natural yet inspiring point.Its fair to say that the writing remained as fast, punchy and gritty as the first book but then turned up a notch! The characters began to grow giving us a chance to learn a little about them. Some new characters were introduced at a nice reasonable pace, allowing me to take it all in without the pain of getting confused between them as can so often happen.All in all, a worthy addition to the series and if anything, better than the first, which is saying something.Again, well done.

The second and third pieces take place together, one on the aircraft carrier, where a zombie is let lose when zealots try and seize the ship, and simultaneously, the Special Forces team from book 1 are parachuted into Chicago to find a cure, which ends up with them chased by most of the 3 million zombies into Lake Michigan, having lost 2 of their team.If the other books are equally as short, I should have them all read in a few days."}, {"userName": "Leighton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11687718-leighton", "userReview": "For poor books remember what Yoda said - \"If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are ... a different game you should play!\"How I review...1 star - binned it before half way, please don't write anymore!!!2 stars - finally binned it after really trying, I mean really trying and I hate to not finishing someth....3 stars - finished it but boy was that hard work on times, it just about hooked me back in as I was about to dump it4 stars - great book but it lacked something, something, can't put my finger on it but.... something5 stars - want more, more books, more movies about the books, more movies about the authors and the making of the movie, just more!!!"}, {"userName": "Ralph Halse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5214851-ralph-halse", "userReview": "Having only come to the Zombie genre recently, I recognise high quality writing when I see it.
