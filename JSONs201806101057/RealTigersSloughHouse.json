I have to say that I am coming to love this smart and compelling series so much. Our disgraced spooks go into action when one of their own, Catherine Standish, a recovering alcoholic, is kidnapped by an ex-soldier seeking vengeance. Her release depends on our spies infiltrating headquarters, Regent's Park, and acquiring classified information. Only nothing is as it seems and what we have is the tip of the iceberg that leads to other plots and counter plots in the intelligence services and the increasing involvement of the tigers. There is the usual Regent Park ambitions, intrigue and shenanigans. There is a deranged and twisted new Home Secretary, Peter 'PJ' Judd who is clearly based on a famous politician we are familiar with. Truth proves to be an exceedingly rare commodity. This is a story of spooks vs spooks rather than external threats and politicians focusing on self interest and their own agendas.Marcus is a gambling addict, Shirley has her cocaine habit, River likes going into action, and Roddy Ho, whilst an internet marvel, lacks social skills, has bizarre fantasies and is a loser in the romance stakes. The iconic head of Slough House is the repulsive, grotesque and brilliant Jackson Lamb who despite his abrasive exterior is going to support and protect his spies. He is more than a match for the machinations of Regent Park, and in dealing with the political demands of PJ. As Regent Park do their usual best to use the slow horses as pawns to further their own ambitions and agendas, our spies do not take matters lying down, they fight back. They encounter murder, revenge, violence and a no holds barred paramilitary assault. Packed with numerous twists, the plotlines begin to come together.There are considerable shifts in the narrative that indicate the level of intricate and complex multi-layered plotting in the novel. There is tension and suspense that keeps the reader hooked. The dialogue and writing is superb. The characters are what drive this story, and the character development is excellent. At the heart of it is the canny Jackson Lamb, a tour de force. The introduction of the venal PJ, the Home Secretary, is a nod to the true life realities of politics within the intelligence services and the threats it raises. There are plenty of comic touches including some that are slapstick. The dark humour is an underlying plank that characterises this entertaining series. Highly recommended read. Thanks to John Murray Press for an ARC."}, {"userName": "PattyMacDotComma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma", "userReview": "4\u2605\u201c\u2018What if they come after you? With guns?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll be fine. Getting shot\u2019s like falling off a log. It doesn\u2019t take practice.\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s as entertaining as the first two in the series, and I\u2019ll include a few more quotes just because, well, just because. I haven\u2019t actually compared page by page, but it felt as if there was a lot more violence and physical action in this one, mostly towards the end, which I\u2019m sure many will find exciting. Myself, I prefer suspense and investigation and figuring things out. And the humour, of course. Herron always leads us into the alley and the side door to the non-descript old building which is Slough House, home of the Slow Horses (a kind of rhyming slang). The description of the stairs, the rooms, the smells, the dingy nature of the place make you cringe to enter. Sometimes he has a cat take us in, or a mouse, or this time, a spirit. It\u2019s that kind of place.We follow the Slow Horses, the same disgraced spies as before who answer to Jackson Lamb, the disreputably attired and disgustingly behaved head of operations in Slough House. But there aren\u2019t any \u201coperations\u201d because these people are no longer operatives. They have all been demoted and hidden away where they are \u201cgradually disappearing under reams of yellowing paper,\u201d never to be seen again.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s not like your department\u2019s a jewel in the Service\u2019s crown, after all. It\u2019s more like a slug in its lettuce patch.\u2019\u201dThey are unwanted. Jackson Lamb\u2019s offsider, Catherine Standish, is a reformed alcoholic, and Lamb is the kind of guy who calls her in to sit across from him and pours them each a drink, determined to push her off the wagon. Nice guy. The others have different problems and all hold out hope that one day, some day, they\u2019ll be transferred back. No chance.Suddenly, there\u2019s a kidnapping, a high level politician, a rivalry between the two women who work for the real spies, and there\u2019s a hunt for the Grey Books. Trouble is, they are in the tightly protected, secure archives of Regent Park, headquarters of the proper spies. It\u2019s hard to know who the good guys are, as with most spy and cop stories, the good guys and bad guys are all pretty familiar with each other and have crossed paths in the past. When someone pops out from the shadows behind, we\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s someone following a character for interest, for protection, or for some sinister reason. Roderick Ho is featured a bit more in this one. He\u2019s the awkward computer nerd who surfs the Dark Net and doesn\u2019t need to rely on Google to look things up. Give him a little while, and he\u2019ll show you your bank account, your phone bill, and when you last went to the dentist. \u201cBecause while Roderick Ho was a dick, that was only the most obvious thing about him, not the most important. Most important was, he knew his way round the cybersphere. This was arguably the only thing keeping him alive. If he weren\u2019t occasionally useful, Marcus or Shirley would have battered him into a porridge by now.\u201dOur old friend River features heavily in the action (we like River), and while he and all the others are suddenly made \u201clive\u201d on an operation, Lamb finds himelf left with only Ho to drive him.\u201c\u2018Now go get your car. Chop chop.\u2019 Ho was halfway down the stairs when Lamb called out, \u2018Oh, and when I say \u201cchop chop\u201d, I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m being racially insensitive?\u2019\u2018No.\u2019\u2018Only you Chinkies can be pretty thin-skinned.\u2019 It was going to be a long drive to High Wycombe.\u201dAnd it was. Quite enjoyable. A little more bone-crunching action that didn\u2019t interest me as much and not quite as compelling a read for me as the first two, but don\u2019t let that put you off. These are entertaining stories written well, and I\u2019m looking forward to the next. These are standalone stories but would still be more fun if you read them in order, I think. But if you can\u2019t, just read what you can find!Thanks to NetGalley and Hachette Australia for the preview copy from which I\u2019ve quoted.

Reading the second book, Dead Lions, confirmed that feeling. Reading this, the third, my fate is sealed! The Slough House characters have all committed some spy faux pas that's demoted them to slow horse status until they quit.Jackson Lamb, head of Slough House, is a curmudgeonly father-type\u2026sometimes. He has some disgusting personal habits. He\u2019s a smart and experienced spook with lots of history. Catherine Standish is elderly, disillusioned, and a non-practicing alcoholic. River Cartwright is smart, but too quick to act. Louisa Guy is in mourning and most likely depressed. Marcus Longridge is a black ops type guy. Roderick Ho is the computer geek and very unsocial. Shirley Guy is young, likes her drink and coke. They are all doing boring, repetitive, and pointless tasks, and every one of them hopes to get back into MI5\u2019s good graces.Ingrid Tearney aka Dame Ingrid is Head of Service, and Diana \u201cLady Di\u201d Taverner is second chair. They are both power-hungry, back-stabbing, conniving women. The plot is something one or both have devised and put into motion.The books are highly character driven. There are character departures and new arrivals in each book of the series. There is black humor, sarcasm, and wit in the dialog.

Three books into the series and the characters are really growing on me. All of them are drop outs and failures for some reason or other but when the pressure is on they all bring out their strengths and somehow they win!The humour in these books is terrific too. I became one of those awful people who has to read bits out loud to anyone in the room and expects them to laugh too. (Even though they have no understanding of what went before or who the people are.)Jackson Lamb is the most politically incorrect person ever and yet he gets away with it. He also provides most of the humour. River is the one you want to see succeed. Catherine seems to have so many secrets and did have a special understanding with Lamb although that may have been dealt a serious blow. I really like Louise too and she has some really good moments in this book.The last page is just brilliant. Perfect even.

This time the threat is not from outside Regents Park and MI5 but inside as politicians and the head and deputy head of MI5 play dangerous power games to gain control over each other. The Slow Horses get dragged in when one of their number, Catherine Standish is kidnapped and held ransom in exchange for certain documents from the MI5 archives. Up against a private army run by an ex soldier with his own agenda, the bunch of misfits from Slough House are soon back in the field fighting for their lives. The plot is clever and multilayered and a delight to see unfold but it is the characters that continue to shine in this series. Jackson Lamb is just brilliant - it's hard to know how much of his character as a shambolic man with disgusting personal hygeine and eating habits is a devious shield behind which he hides his true intelligence and astuteness. All the characters get their moment in the spotlight, including the head of MI5, Ingrid Tierney and her second desk Diana 'Lady Di' Taverner, both of them lethal and manipulative, as well as the odious Home Secretary Judd with Prime Ministerial ambitions. As with the earlier books, there is much dark humour in Herron's wonderful writing, both in the situations his misfits find themselves in as well as the dialogue. One of the memorable moments of the book occurs when Roddy Ho is forcibly separated from his computer and dreams of what he'd like to do to women (if only he got the chance) and taken out into the field by Lamb. Told to come to Lamb's rescue if he doesn't reappear Roddy comes up with a equally unique and inept rescue plan that still makes me snigger when I think of the book.With thanks to Netgalley and the publisher Hachette for a digital copy to read."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "This is the third in the Slough House series, where the \u2018Slow Horses\u2019 reside \u2013 those M15 operatives who have made mistakes and have been shunted off to do administrative tasks; either because of personal failures or embarrassing mistakes. Slough House is presided over by Jackson Lamb, who, although now he appears to be slovenly, unkempt and interested only in himself, was once an undercover operative during the Cold War and, despite his appearances, is not only still quite capable of out manoeuvring those at the Park, but he is fiercely loyal to those he is responsible for and anyone he considers to be one of his own.One of the members of Lamb\u2019s team is recovering alcoholic, Catherine Standish. Although it is difficult to say that Lamb is fond of any of the inhabitants of Slough House; Catherine acts as something of a buffer between him and everyone else and, as such, he at least notices she is gone. The reason for her sudden absence is that she is snatched in what appears to be a straightforward kidnap. However, as with all of these novels, nothing is straightforward and the Slow Horses may soon be heading back into the field and into danger as they become involved in a complicated and complex plot . I would really suggest that these books be read in order \u2013 the first being \u201cSlow Horses,\u201d followed by \u201cDead Lions.\u201d This is a very believable world of spooks, politics, double dealing, conspiracy, intrigue and naked ambition; all wrapped up with very British concerns of saving money, muddling through, often with no discernable plan, and wrapping the intention to win at all costs in the politest language possible. Savagery, but all done with a smile, and very dark humour. At the centre of every web is the magnificent Jackson Lamb, who suddenly emerges from his seeming stupor to take on his superiors and take back what he considers to be rightfully his.Despite the fact that Slough House is seen very much as the place where the losers of the Secret Service are made to regret the way their career has collapsed, it is also, very obviously, a thorn in the side of those in power. These include new Home Secretary Peter Judd (who bears more than a little resemblance to a current politician), the head of the Park, Ingrid Tearney and her second in command, Diana Taverner. However, all of these political, and power players, have their own agenda and, in order to gain the upper hand, Lamb must outmanoeuvre them all. This series has been my first great series discovery of 2017 and I am so glad that I finally got around to reading the first novel."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "This series is really growing on me. Who can resist the slow horses, the failed MI-5 agents, these anti-Bonds? All of them desperately want to be back in the espionage game and not pushing paper after boring paper over in Slough House, a facility so obscure many members-in-good-standing of MI-5 don\u2019t even know it exists. So when any excuse presents itself, they fall all over themselves to get out there and try to kick some butt.For me, it\u2019s the characters that really make these stories work. I can\u2019t help but root for River Cartwright, who ended up at Slough House when a practice op that he was running was sabotaged by a frenemy and went horribly wrong. I\u2019m cheering for him to finally be able to prove his worth and go back to the main office. All the denizens of Slough House have some horrible failure in their backgrounds\u2014alcoholism, gambling addiction, a reliance on cocaine, you name it. And then there\u2019s my favourite\u2014Rodney Ho, who is just so obnoxious that no one wants him in their office. Rodney has no social skills, a vivid fantasy life, and the ability to work the internet like no one else in the office. If you\u2019re a Criminal Minds fan, think of him as a male version of Garcia with no redeeming human graces. His misguided attempts to blackmail the other slow horses or try to attract romantic attention provide the light moments in these thrillers.Of course, there is always Jackson Lamb, the rather revolting supervisor of this motley lot. Messy, rude, bigoted, and able to produce a reeking fart at will, he is about as far from the Bond ideal as you can get, and yet he proves himself a very capable agent on many occasions. One of the reasons that I keep reading is to figure out exactly how Lamb got to this situation.If you\u2019re tired of professional spies wearing slick clothes and drinking sophisticated cocktails, give the Slough House bunch a try.

Yes, really. It may seem like an odd start but no worries. It's merely the first step into a plot with more twists & switchbacks than your average maze.This is book #3 in the \"Slough House\" series. And it's another riveting tale with a healthy dose of laugh out loud black humour.\u00a0Slough House is the end of the road for MI5 agents. Not just anyone can get in. Each of these men & women has screwed up royally at some point in their career. Now they perform tasks so mind numbing, the tedium is only relieved by boredom.But there's about to be a shake-up in the routine. When one of them gets proof a coworker has been snatched, it sets in motion a chain of events that will see them dusting off skills they haven't used in a long time.Meanwhile, over at Regent Park, the bigwigs at MI5 have their own shake-up to deal with. There's a new Home Secretary overseeing the intelligence service & flexing his political muscle. He's also crazy. Forget foreign terrorists...you're more likely to be taken out by a colleague. Lying is like breathing for these people, necessary for life & they've elevated backstabbing to a level worthy of the Olympics.As the story progresses, separate plot lines & characters begin to converge as old secrets & alliances come to light. Turns out while you were busy being entertained by machaivellian office politics, a classic game of spy vs. spy was underway.\u00a0This is not a standard thriller pitting the bad guys against the good. It's more like the ethically challenged against the least reprehensible. Luckily for us, they're hilarious.Jackson Lamb rules Slough House with an iron fist & he's an equal opportunity offender. A memo outlining PC practices would quickly die of loneliness in the tip he calls an office. But don't be fooled. His caustic barbs (& dubious hygiene) provide cover for a man who's seen it all. Nothing gets by him & he's secretly protective of his little flock of misfits.They include recovered alcoholic Catherine Standish, trying-to-quit gambler Marcus Longridge & actively delusional Rodney Ho. As for Home Secretary Peter Judd, all I can say is....eeewww.What a great read. The author combines well developed characters with darkly funny dialogue them wraps them up tight in a smart, intricate plot. The last third is a full on thriller that has you turning the pages to see who is left standing.

After 20% of the book, that is when the real interest begins (okay so maybe not 20% exactly, but you get the jist)There are so many interesting characters in this book it is really hard to pinpoint which character I like better, I feel like there wasn't much depth to the characters. Now, this could be because of two reasons; one I have not read the other books in the series and two this book does not primarily focus on depth of the character but puts more emphasis on the plot instead which is a fairgiven. Finally! A book where there is a break between the different POV's. Hooray!I like to think I would have liked Lamb as he was a pain in the ass to the other characters but there was also something about him that you could not help but like. However, some of his erm...actions were off putting so I can't say I enjoyed that very much! Ew! But,it did cause a bit of a break between the scenes in the book which were very refreshing!The plot? Is quite confusing not in the sense of understanding it but trying to explain it. There are 'schemes' which take place within this book which is part of a bigger plan, you have to note here this books kind of takes on a Political agenda (which reminds me, I hated Judd's character what a big jerk, selfish, conceited human being). Everything that happens to the slow horses (what a dergatory term for those people who are basically useless)is an act leading upto the bigger phase where these people in power are frenemies and are fighting to gain more power (and keep their position).

Slough House, that \u201cadministrative oubliette\u201d of the intelligence service, is a repository for inconvenient or incompetent spooks: the spies who have caused embarrassment by losing a gun runner on surveillance, have anger management issues, or managed to close down Kings Cross Station in a training exercise. The current staff of seven \u201cslow horses\u201d occupy their time with tasks like comparing census results for anomalies, or checking passports issued during the \u201981 Civil Service strike. But now, one of their number has been kidnapped, and the ransom involves access to classified files. River Cartwright\u2019s impulsive attempt to follow this demand sees him caught, interrogated and thoroughly beaten. It turns out to be a busy twenty-four hours for the slow horses: they are assaulted, shot at, sacked, tasered, and threatened with closure. Weapons include a broken CD, a Klieg light, a metal pipe, and even Jackson Lamb wields a gun. Roderick Ho pauses in his deluded belief of virility, to actually leave the office and crash a double-decker bus. Once again, Herron gives the reader a fast-paced spy novel of a very different sort. The premise is original, and the execution is inspired. The characters are all credibly flawed, their dialogue is full of understated dry wit, and there is plenty of humour, most of it very black and very British, with an abundance of laugh out loud moments. There are twists and red herrings and plenty of back-stabbing and the reader will find it hard not to cheer these misfits on as they do their best.

I think more time passing between books would have made this a bit more believable (months instead of weeks).. that's a minor quibble, though. I'd really love to see someone try to bring Jackson Lamb to life on screen.. that'd be something!I really enjoyed Marcus and Shirley...especially the irony of Shirley being the real bad mother, and Marcus ending up on his back alot.I really hope the overriding plot can work to allow more stories with these wonderfully quirkly characters."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31175766-kathy", "userReview": "Note to self: went back to read the Slough House books in prep for newest coming in 2018 and found I did not care for level of brutality, vulgarity...coupled with outrageous behavior of British Intelligence.

Having heard lots about Herron's series I dove into the deep end, possibly a mistake, with the third in the series.The group of 'slow horses' he puts together are misfits, or recovering / failed members of the organisation who will see their time out pushing pens in their Slough House office. But of course it isn't quite like that. They become the heroes in this novel, and I guess the others in the series also. Other characters are strong also, notably the boss, Jackson Lamb. Their antics were of far less interest to me in this novel though, and at times I found it too light-hearted, a bit childish even.

Walking home, Catherine Standish meets a former lover from her days as a lush, but this is no chance encounter and she finds herself kidnapped for reasons she doesn\u2019t understand. Asked which of her colleagues she trusts with her life, she picks River, so he is the one sent the hostage photo, and ordered to break into the MI5 base at Regents Park to steal a secret file. This doesn\u2019t go well, and soon the whole team are involved in trying to rescue both of them.Herron\u2019s writing is again superb, with cutting humour and witty similes. The characters, most truly awful, are just brilliant: you want to cheer when the odious drug addict Shirley Dander backhands the loathsome misanthropic geek Roderick Ho, and cheer again when they come to the rescue of the team mates they don\u2019t even like, because somehow, yet again, the noxious Jackson Lamb has inspired them. The evil politician Peter Judd, clearly modelled on BoJo, returns, and we learn more about the machinations of both Ingrid Tearney, the boss (\u201cFirst desk\u201d) and second desk Diana Taverner - I\u2019m still unsure which is the more evil or Machiavellian.I received a free ARC (all 5 books of the series) from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Keith Currie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18082549-keith-currie", "userReview": "Catherine Standish, Slow Horse and alcoholic, finds herself taken hostage \u2013 but she is confined in a self-catering let with en-suite bathroom and is served wine with her evening meal, her captors, two ex-soldiers and a young man with tattoos. What sort of hostage scenario is this? What can the soldiers (one of whom is an old acquaintance and has just been released from prison) want?As usual in Mick Herron\u2019s espionage novels the real villains are the spies themselves, at least those who are in the upper echelons of the Regent Park hierarchy. And there is a very slow reveal here of how the Catherine Standish kidnapping relates to amoral and immoral activities in the pasts of some of MI5\u2019s most important people. There is also another villain, a blond, floppy haired MP with a penchant for using words such as \u2018Blimey!\u2019 or \u2018Cripes!\u2019 (at least in public), and who is clearly not a fictional construct of a real-life MP with similar foibles.In addition, there are the Slow horses themselves, the failed spies of Slough House, who have the most refined ability to create mayhem and chaos. The whole plot culminates in a violent shoot-out in a converted underground bunker facility.

While the first two books in the series are good, Herron really hits it out of the park with this outing. The two key elements \u2013 plot and characterisation \u2013 are excellent. The slow horses are pawns in a much larger game between a vengeful ex-army senior officer, a clownish but ruthless politician, the head of MI5 and her internal rival. There\u2019s plenty of scheming, backstabbing, action, and twists and turns, and Herron ratchets up the tension with the slow horses stumbling and fumbling towards a resolution, led by Jackson Lamb, who respects his charges just as little as the rest of the organization but believes the only person who should make their lives a misery is himself. Rather than being a simple linear tale, Herron creates a multi-threaded and layered story with the strands being drawn to a climatic showdown and intriguing fallout. Along with the insufferable, abrasive Lamb, the slow horses are a delight \u2013 Catherine is a recovering alcoholic, Shirley has a coke habit, Marcus has a problem with gambling, River acts before thinking, and Roddy is a delusional geek with zero social skills. Added into the mix is a home secretary clearly modelled on Boris Johnson, and two scheming, hard-headed spymasters in the Stella Remington mould. The dialogue and social relations between characters is nicely done as is the storytelling in general. There is also a delicious streak of dark humour running throughout and I laughed out loud at several points.

But Marcus is a gambling addict. Shirley's a cokehead (\"It was a weekend thing with her, strictly Thursday to Tuesday\"). Catherine is a recovering alcoholic, Louisa a sex addict, Roddy a hacker with a toxic personality. And River screwed up a large-scale training mission so publicly that he caused all traffic to come to a halt at one of London's busiest tube stations during rush hour. These misfits are the unwilling residents of Slough House, a crumbling old building far from the action in London where MI5 stashes the screw-ups it can't find ways to fire. There, they all carry on meaningless secretarial tasks under the direction of the legendary Jackson Lamb. (\"Nobody left Slough House at the end of a working day feeling like they'd contributed to the security of the nation.\") Jackson was once a high-level field operative who managed to get on the wrong side of the director general. Now he sits behind closed doors in a cluttered office on the top floor of Slough House, belching, farting, drinking, and growling at anyone who comes within his field of vision.In Real Tigers, the fourth book in Mick Herron's entertaining series about the misadventures of this motley crew of spooks, the so-called \"slow horses\" of Slough House come into conflict once again with the formidable Diana Taverner. \"Lady Di\" is a deputy director who runs MI5's operations division when she's not scheming to force her boss out of the agency and take on the directorship herself. Though forbidden from getting involved in any meaningful operations, the slow horses somehow always seem to get drawn, willingly or not, into some case that exposes them to real-world danger.This time, in Real Tigers, the case begins to unfold when Catherine is kidnapped after leaving work one evening. Then River is confronted by one of the kidnappers and shown a photo on his phone of Catherine tied up and gagged. She will not live, he's told, unless he steals a top-secret file from Regent's Park the MI5 headquarters. When River himself disappears on this mission, Jackson and his charges at Slough House swing into action. Naturally, they don't have a clue what they're getting into. They will find themselves in conflict again with Lady Di; with her boss, Dame Ingrid Tearney; with her boss, the Home Secretary; with MI5's enforcers, the Dogs; and with a small army of private security thugs. As the action plays out, Herron's tale becomes increasingly complicated\u2014but it's all glorious fun. Herron is a masterful wordsmith with genuine talent at nonstop banter. Even if you lose track of the thread of the story, which is easy to do, you'll enjoy the action while it lasts.There's a hint of the story in the novel's opening sentence: \"Like most forms of corruption, it began with men in suits.\" And Herron's descriptions of characters are frequently priceless. Here, for example, is the Home Secretary: \"blue suit, yellow tie, artfully tousled haystack of hair and a plummy grin you'd have to be a moron or a voter not to notice concealed a degree of self-interest that would alienate a shark.\"In addition to the five books that now comprise the Slough House series, Mick Herron has written four other novels since 2003. He has twice won recognized awards for his fiction and been shortlisted for many others."}, {"userName": "Rowena Hoseason", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29937893-rowena-hoseason", "userReview": "Mick Herron blows the bl**dy doors off with the opening chapters of Real Tigers. This is stand-out, showboat, top rank writing, honed close to perfection with all the skill and dedication of an artisan craftsman. But if you haven\u2019t read the two earlier novels in the \u2018Slough House\u2019 trilogy will probably find it utterly impenetrable. So if you\u2019ve not already experienced \u2018Slow Horses\u2019 then go back and start there. Slough House is the career cul-de-sac where MI5 sends its hopeless but unsackable agents to harmlessly fade to grey; alcoholics, an IT geek with hopeless personal skills, disgraced field agents and the magnificent Jackson Lamb. All the wonderfully indulgent tradecraft, operating procedures and agency slang are worth getting to know properly before you indulge yourself in the glorious experience that is the first quarter of Real Tigers.After then, the style fades somewhat and by the final third the plot goes wildly implausible with a Bond-style shoot out to save the day / the country\u2019s secrets / a kidnapped Slow Horse / Lamb\u2019s career. But it\u2019s possible to forgive the less likely events, which include the kind of bodycount that\u2019d make Rambo proud, to enjoy Herron\u2019s pointed political and social observations, his skilful character manipulation, and his sweetly understated but savagely cynical dialogue.The Slough House series focuses on internal agency and political rivalries. This is all about in-fighting and back-stabbing. Homeland security comes a very distant second to personal ambition: sod the terrorists, Herron\u2019s spies are far too busy out-manoeuvring each other to worry about external threats.If anything, I think the author has just about exhausted the dramatic potential in this scenario, where intelligence agents spend their entire lives conspiring against their own colleagues. I hope that when these characters return (\u2018Spook Street\u2019 is the next in the series) then he unwraps a new plot which doesn\u2019t involve one layer of MI5 scheming against the next. It\u2019s been mighty fun thus far, but the premise is wearing thin.8/10There's a more detailed version of this review over at https://murdermayhemandmore.wordpress..."}, {"userName": "Paul Dumont", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12762322-paul-dumont", "userReview": "Nobody left Slough House at the end of the day feeling like they\u2019d contributed to the security of the nation.

Shot through with black humour (the prelude is probably going to be unfilmable should See Saw Films exercise their TV series option) \u201cReal Tigers\u201d puts the Slough House team up against the clock when one of their own is kidnapped.

This time, a senior politician - who seems uncannily similar to Britain's current foreign secretary - is pulling the strings. Or is he?

The writing is great, the dialogue witty, the storyline interestingly tricky, but if you\u2019re looking for a leCarre style spy novel, this ain\u2019t it! Slough House is a British Secret Service dumping ground for those agents who\u2019ve really \u2018effed up\u2019. They\u2019re known as the \u2018slow horses\u2019, and that\u2019s not a good thing. Their leader, Jackson Lamb, is one of my favorite characters: fat, lazy, smelly, sloppy, but in possession of a quick wit, the sharpest of tongues, a legendary past career as an Ops guy, and knowledge of where the metaphorical bodies are buried. Slough House is viewed with derision by the entire rest of Brit intelligence but Lamb doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s his team of screw ups and he knows exactly what they can and can\u2019t do.Real Tigers begins with the kidnapping of Lamb\u2019s assistant. It\u2019s not a \u2018real\u2019 crime, just part of a \u2018tiger\u2019 operation by the Intelligence organization to test its internal responsiveness. Except it\u2019s much more than that, with suddenly not only intra & interdepartmental warfare breaking out but also a 3rd party who\u2019d been brought in to help with the Tiger operation going rogue for unknown reasons. Lamb and his slow horses are engaged to do some dirty work, not because of their expertise but because they\u2019re \u2018off the books\u2019 and therefore insulating the higher ups in case something goes south. It does, no surprise there, but it all gets settled in the end with some violence and maximum backstabbing.Slough House is a great series, but it\u2019s unlike anything else in the genre. There\u2019s a lot of humor, but it\u2019s not silly stuff. More like witty repartee among a bunch of self aware screwups and their fearless leader. They do serious work, sometimes not particularly well, but they certainly try hard. Lamb is the best buffer ever, which is definitely needed since his peers and the higher ups in Intelligence are a bunch of snakes. The strengths of the series are the excellent writing, the great characters, and the humor that\u2019s woven through the serious situations the slow horses get themselves into. It\u2019s great!"}], "description": "When one of their own is kidnapped, the washed-up MI5 operatives of Slough House--the Slow Horses, as they're known--outwit rogue agents at the very highest levels of British Intelligence, and even to Downing Street itself.

The -Slow Horses, - as the failed spies of Slough House are called, are doomed to spend the rest of their careers pushing paper, but they all want back in on the action. When one of their own is kidnapped and held for ransom, the agents of Slough House must defeat the odds, overturning all expectations of their competence, to breach the top-notch security of MI5's intelligence headquarters, Regent's Park, and steal valuable intel in exchange for their comrade's safety. The kidnapping is only the tip of the iceberg, however--the agents uncover a larger web of intrigue that involves not only a group of private mercenaries but the highest authorities in the Secret Service. After years spent as the lowest on the totem pole, the Slow Horses suddenly find themselves caught in the midst of a conspiracy that threatens not only the future of Slough House, but of MI5 itself.", "title": "Real Tigers\n      \n          (Slough House #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30025541-real-tigers", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1484319073l/30025541.jpg", "reviews": 248, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1237964.Mick_Herron", "name": "Mick Herron"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Thriller", "Spy Thriller", "Thriller", "Suspense"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30025541-real-tigers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25279701-real-tigers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27810591-real-tigers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596936-real-tigers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29358455-real-tigers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25430519-real-tigers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29497235-real-tigers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7929891-slow-horses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15823478-dead-lions", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30282181-spook-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35227062-london-rules", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22358131-nobody-walks"]}
