The characters are so engaging and the plot is so filled with twists and turns and ups and downs that I just wanted to find out what was going to happen next. The author does such a great job of describing the environment and what the characters are experiencing that I felt as if I was a participant. If you've read immortality you've probably been waiting impatiently for the sequel. The wait was well worth it. If you haven't read Immortality, no need to worry because Ghost of the Gods stands on its own as a great read. This book offers so much to any reader. Whether you like mysteries, thrillers, love stories, science fiction, politics, philosophy, or just any well written book then you'll enjoy Ghost of the Gods."}, {"userName": "Tom McDonald", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48751155-tom-mcdonald", "userReview": "Intriguing storyThis is an interesting story about man/machine interactions exploring history, reincarnation, communal consciences, and singularity. Its woven around an unusual !I've story. It also has lots of action interspersed with the hero's journey."}, {"userName": "Don Viecelli", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5635363-don-viecelli", "userReview": "From My Newsletter Number 103:This review is on Ghost of the Gods by Kevin Bohacz. It is the second book in the series I have read by this author. This story begins with a Prologue that describes the human transformation the lead character, Mark Freedman, is going through. Mark has evolved into a nanotech augmented hybrid being who is now connected to the god-machine controlling the world. His mind processes data received automatically from the god-machine that is hosted through nanotech seed supercolonies hiding in the oceans. The god-machine is an artificial intelligence created by an unknown race in the beginning of time. It is responsible for the near extinction of humans several times in the past.Mark is not the only human that has been infected by nanotech seeds to become a hybrid linked to the god-machine. The seeds are imbedded in COBIC bacteria that grow within all life forms on the planet since before recorded time. All seeds are linked together through a worldwide wireless web network and communicate with the god-machine. The god-machine has determined once again it is time to reduce the human population to prevent complete human extinction due to climate change and other factors. There seems to be no way to stop the Kill Zones from completing the cleansing.The nanotech plague has killed over six billion humans so far. Mark is with Sarah who is also a hybrid. They are traveling together seeking answers to the plague and how to stop it, but there is opposition from more than just the god-machine and it becomes very difficult distinguishing friend from foe. As the plot unfolds, the author introduces new after-death experiences in this story, which slow the pace down in certain chapters. Still, the characters are well developed and the main plot keeps the suspense in high gear as the remaining humans struggle to stop the Kill Zones and the god-machine with deadly consequences. I give this story four stars because it is interesting and the technical details are so complete that you have to be impressed with the time and effort it took to create them. Keep reading good science fiction and let me know when you find an interesting novel or author."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8178700-michael", "userReview": "This was far better than Immortality. He has clearly honed his writing skills and the hand of a better editor was evident. As a novel of ideas, this book is utterly superb! I was fascinated throughout. The mark of an excellent book, for me, is reading a few paragraphs or pages then staring into space simply thinking for 15 minutes! It took me far longer than usual to read because I did just that! In a very real way, this was Transhumanist porn! The descriptions of the nanoseed God machine enhancements were thrilling. Human and machine interactions are where the writer shines very brightly indeed! He makes these esoteric experiences come to life! I tend not to judge books of this sort too harshly in terms of writing proficiency and all those little things that can stand out and annoy the \"experienced reader\". This is a book of ideas, and large ideas they are! The first book Immortality had enormous potential but it was only toward the end that my appetite was truly whetted. I am gratified to have been served a whole banquet in this second book! That being said, there were a number of distracting typos, which is ridiculous! And having the book divided into those headers with the character and date was a silly idea. It wasn't helpful or useful in any way. One thing that struck me as...well, odd, was that all the characters spent a noticably inordinate amount of time speculating on what could be happening and exploring possible unknowable motives. It wasn't a bad thing to have the characters do but it was frequent and extensive. It did serve to keep me on edge as to what would happen next as it, invariably, was nothing that was pondered and debated. I'm quite hoping there will be a third book in this series but whatever he writes next will be eagerly read by me!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Clausen-greene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6457393-jennifer-clausen-greene", "userReview": "Brilliant follow up book to Immorality that I loved. This book though will not stand on its own and will confuse you if you do not read the first book. If you had read the first one than you see that this one picks up a few years after the \"God Machine\" plagues that started as an outpouring of wrath for humans not taking care of the Earth. If you love science and phenomenon's surrounds telepathy, precognitive & lucid dreams, etc you will adore this book. The author does a great job creating a model trying to get us to think outside the box and really explore the chemistry and science behind our consciousness. The story has so many twists and turns that are suspense filled all the way through that you never know where it is going to go. Every time you think you got a grasp on the realities within you find out you are wrong. Kevin does give us the satisfaction of the epilogue that takes place 10 years into the future and really sums things up nicely, so you dont get left hanging.

Was a little disappointed. Way too much technical discussion. A little heavy on the religious comparisons. I enjoyed the military and weapons descriptions in the first book but this book was a little overwhelming. Too much of a good thing. I did enjoy the ending and I would recommend reading it as a follow up to book one. I just had to skim through some paragraphs that were a little heavy or bogged down."}, {"userName": "Julianne G Cockey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27040643-julianne-g-cockey", "userReview": "The End, or is it?This book continues as good as the first, but with more details on the computers to the point I read \"bla bla bla, got it\". However, I did enjoy the all too real story. Some will like all the descriptions of weapons I simply read as \"guns & bigger ones\". The author wraps up with an ending that could be open for another sequel or leave it as is.

Ghost of the Gods was the #1 hottest new bestselling techno-thriller on Amazon March 2014.Publisher's Weekly STARRED review:\u00a0In this sequel to Bohacz's\u00a0Immortality, two years after the devastation of mass human extinctions in kill zones, mankind is still grasping for survival. An oppressive union of government and big business controls an exhausted America, which is divided between walled-in Protectorates and the unpoliced Outlands. Against this chaotic backdrop, paleobiologist and genetic researcher Mark Freedman and policewoman Sarah Mayfair continue their evolution into transhumance - nanotech hybrids with a connection to the god machine, the artificial intelligence that caused the recent massacres, in an effort to derail the destruction of the Earth's biosphere. Bohacz provides mind-bending portrayals of factions vying for power and reflections on the essence and fragility of humanity. But philosophical concerns never obtrude on the fast-paced plot, as authorities investigate communes of hybrids, and Freedman and Mayfair must choose between absorption into a collective mind or fidelity to their remaining humanity. The question of who can be trusted impels the reader to keep turning the pages of this highly satisfying and dynamic techno-thriller.", "title": "Ghost of the Gods", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20957994-ghost-of-the-gods", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1393865794l/20957994.jpg", "reviews": 12, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/411275.Kevin_Bohacz", "name": "Kevin Bohacz"}], "type": ["Science Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Audiobook", "Thriller", "Philosophy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20957994-ghost-of-the-gods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18971081-ghost-of-the-gods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1706898.Immortality"]}
