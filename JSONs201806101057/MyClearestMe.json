This was my first thought after I read my review copy of My Clearest Me by Claudine Gueh Yanting and Sarah Quek Rui Zhen. The second and third time I read the illustrated story, I confirmed to myself both times that \u201ca touching classic\u201d is a very apt description of the book. My Clearest Me immediately reminds me of The Little Prince by Antione de Saint Exupery. In many ways, though, My Clearest Me is different. It introduces Wynn, a black-haired six-year-old boy, who overhears his teacher telling his mother about (1) him being very quiet (2) so he might have no friends and (3) might let dreams pass. Wynn, curious and little and contemplative, wonders if he should be another kind of boy in order to fit in with crowd. Apparently, his perception of that crowd is limited--it\u2019s rowdy and noisy.He embarks on a touching journey of self-discovery and learns to accept and love himself for who he is. In his words, he said, \u201cI love my clearest me.\u201d By saying so, Wynn affirms to the world that he has found his voice and the answer to his personal question. To him, he knows who he is. His next question is, \u201cWill the others like it, too?\u201d This is answered in a series of moving experiences complemented with clear eye-catching drawings. My Clearest Me\u2019s story is written in simple original rhyme by Claudine Gueh Yanting and presented in colorful and vivid strokes by Sarah Quek Rui Zhen.My favorite line in the book, among many others, is, \u201cI am a breathing wind. A bout that flies and flows at night. I like being quiet and bold.\u201dAlthough it is a quick read, as a reader and reviewer, I have to read it a couple more times to get and drink in the message of the story, which is that of self-acceptance. If you decide to read this with your child, you will have to read it several times with him, too, as a subtle way of empowering him or her to decide what he or she wants to be and accept and be proud of that decision.It is this particular theme that struck me because it is not meant for children only. Many of us adults are going through the motions of living without really finding our voice with the passion that Wynn has. Many of us adults are always on the go that we forget to pause, breathe, and take a minute to contemplate the world swirling fast around us. Technically, it is recommended for read-together for children four years old and up and for read-alone for children ages five to eight.For me, after stamping this with my five stars, I recommend My Clearest Me to all ages. And I must add: savor each page!Nancy @ Simple Clockworkhttp://www.nancycudis.com"}, {"userName": "Erik This Kid Reviews Books", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7532583-erik-this-kid-reviews-books", "userReview": "Wynn hears his teacher telling his mother that he is too quiet. She says she worries that he won\u2019t make friends and he won\u2019t be able to live his dreams. Wynn wonders if he should be loud and rowdy like the other kids. His mother tells him to be anyway he wants to be. Wynn still wonders if he should try to \u201cfit in\u201d and be more like the other kids. After wandering around and talking to the moon and the stars, Wynn decides he likes himself the way he is. He knows he will make friends and he will be who he wants to be.I really enjoyed this book. I like Wynn because he\u2019s not shy but he\u2019s a quiet boy and he decides that he just likes who he is. He decides he shouldn\u2019t be what others think he should. Sometimes I feel like I am quiet (like I like to read A LOT and that\u2019s a quiet thing to do). I know how Wynn feels. The illustrations have a great amount of color and beauty and they go with the story well. I think it would make a great read aloud book.I like what Claudine Gueh Yanting said about Wynn on the book\u2019s website -\u201cLike Wynn, I tried fitting in with the crowd I was in, I tried raising a ruckus wreck, and I felt really tired afterwards. Worn out, lost, and still, darn it, rather small. Wynn is much cleverer. He accepts who he is and enjoys what he likes. \u201c"}, {"userName": "Patricia Kemp Blackmon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5314062-patricia-kemp-blackmon", "userReview": "This book is about self-acceptance. Wynn a sweet six year old boy overhears his teacher say he is quiet and does not fit in with the other children. So he goes on an emotional journey to discover himself. He tries to figure out how he can fit in with the noisy rowdy classmates. Maybe, just maybe he can join in on their games and still be himself. I feel as if the story shows instead of him being traumatized by the comments made about him he analyzed his situation and overcame with flying colors.This was a touching story about learning to fit in with the world but yet remain true to yourself. The illustrations clarified the story of this child's journey into the world of his peers. I loved this story. Some of us are just introverts. I don't think it means we have some disability. It just means we are big thinkers. We can learn a lot about ourselves by interacting with others. It doesn't have to mean we loose who we are. I highly recommend this book.I rated this book 5 out of 5DisclosureI purchased a copy of this ebook for review. I was in no way compensated for this review it is my own opinion."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7384498-paul", "userReview": "My Clearest Me is a wonderful picture book. The artwork is very cute, very well done. Wynn and his teddy bear are adorable. The story has an excellent message about being oneself, not trying be something that you're not. The book provides an excellent example of a mother's support, love and encouragment. This book should be on every parents bookshelf. They should include this in their nightime story rotation for sure. I'm very much a believer in books with a little something to them. I know that silly, funny books have their place, certainly, but a book that is uplifting with a strong message and values is very important. My Clearest me is about being true to yourself and your dreams as well as being who you are. If you do these things, you will be happy, fulfill your dreams as well as love and be loved.

In My Clearest Me, six-year-old Wynn\u2019s teacher expresses concern that he might have no friends or let dreams pass him by because he is quiet. When Wynn overhears her worries, he begins to wonder: how is he \u201csupposed\u201d to be? He then embarks on a journey of self-discovery. By the end of the book he has learned more about himself, who he is, and who he wants to be.In the author\u2019s statement at the end of the book, Gueh Yanting, Claudine expresses her desire to \u201cencourage children to be a little braver, to love themselves more, and to build their strongest world.\u201d With My Clearest Me, she does exactly that!"}, {"userName": "Angela Lambkin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21089551-angela-lambkin", "userReview": "I choose to give the book \" My Clearest Me \" five stars for a well written and illustrated and colorful loving book for young children to help them to have a better image of themselves then they may at this time! I liked this story and I think most children should too. And hopefully their parents will also and will be supportive In this respect for their child who probablyneeds this encouragement!

The illustrations are delightful and add a grace and beauty to an already special tale. I think this book is worthy of publication as it is, with any edits being so minor as to hardly be noticeable. The book would be a meaningful addition to any child's home or school library.

The words seamlessly float through gorgeous illustrations. I enjoyed following Wynn--a wise little boy--on his quest to discover his inner feelings about who he is in this world.
