Instead of a band of survivors on the run trying to make it to safety, this is about a town that has dug in after the zombie apocalypse, and maybe that's why. I like the 'must cross the danger zone to survive' sorts of apocalypse books, because when they're stationary, it's less thrilling. But that's just a personal quirk. Anyhoo, the plot is basically that this small midwest town has dug in post-zombie-apoc, and when a gang of strangers ride in, things begin to change. The characters were good, the text was crisp and it was by far the most readable thing on my kindle at the moment. I think there were less zombies in this one than the last, and I have to admit I wanted more zombies. :)Still one of the better zombie reads out there, if you're looking for something along these lines.This is also told in rotating 1st person POV from the hero/heroine, and that took a little getting used to."}, {"userName": "Brandi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9081836-brandi", "userReview": "IM SOOOO SAD PLEEEEEAAAASE WRITE MORE BOOKS LIKE THESE!!!

The group are allowed to stay but unknown to the town they are concealing a sick child, bitten by a zombie. Despite the differences between the new group and the townspeople, when packs of zombies start threatening the town, everyone has to work together to survive.The actual plot was good. Brian was at college, living the dream of escaping his dull town when he came home for a visit just as the apocalypse came, leaving him trapped. Fes was never able to escape the town and wonders now if he ever will. They are doing patrols to kill any zombies outside the town fences to keep everyone safe when the motorcycles pull up. When they realise the strangers mean them no harm they escort the group to town and they are reluctantly given sanctuary if they help with the coming harvest, which is agreed. However a sudden zombie attack in the fields takes everyone by surprise and the survivors are quarantined, leading to angry exchanges between the town council and the strangers. Attacks on the town increase and nerves are on edge as Brian battles to come up with a plan to save them.I liked Brian as a character. He's smart and could be doing a lot more to help the town instead of just zombie patrol, something soon realised by the town council after the field attack. I also like Fes, who is devoted to his town and doing whatever is necessary to keeping it safe. Janice, the head of the council, is quite happy to issue orders and sleep in her bed at night while ordinary people do all the work to keep them safe. I hated the lazy bitch. Ashleigh also annoyed me. She is always getting annoyed by Daylon not taking her seriously and moaning that she wants to be an independent woman who doesn't rely on men to take care of her but the first thing she does when she meets Brian is try to seduce him so he will take care of her. She is happy to use her looks and body to get what she wants then whines about men only seeing her that way. Shut up and stop moaning you stupid tart!What did drive me crazy were the motorcycle group. First they lie about having a bitten child so they can get into the town and enjoy food, water, beds, showers and electricity. They are quite happy to endanger the whole town and betray the goodness of Brian who vouched for them. One of them who is believed dead in the field attack turns up alive days later and is furious that no search team was sent out to find her. Yeah, everyone that got back to town escaped by the their skin and the zombie's teeth and they would endanger a whole new group of people by sending them out there for someone believed dead? Selfish much? They whine about working to earn their keep despite the fact that they offered to work! The strangers kick off about going into quarantine after the attack to be checked for bites and act as if the town are being unreasonable about protecting their citizens. When the concealment of the infected child is discovered and the group are told to leave, they think they are being badly treated! They are a bunch of rude ungrateful tossers! Putting aside some real idiots amongst the characters there is some decent zombie action in the book set against a backdrop of a community fighting to survive. There is tension as each night gunshots are heard on the town boundaries with the odd zombie getting in and having to be put down. I liked the scenes with the attack in the fields and of course the big finale. They were quite well written and enjoyable. There are a few sex scenes which I don't think add much to the overall plot and I just skipped them. I didn't feel any real chemistry between Brian and Ashleigh and I think he could've done better for himself. But this is marketed as zombie romance so I just skipped the bits that bored me. Not the best in the genre but a decent enough read."}, {"userName": "Wulfwyn ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2288988-wulfwyn", "userReview": "I enjoyed After the End slightly more than Dead Country. Both books follow a group of survivors during the zombie apocalypse. They are different groups though. The setting this time is mainly in a small town that is pretty safe. Or was. There is a lot of action in this book. I wouldn't say I truly connected with the characters but that might be because I knew from After the End to not get attached. Normally I hate when that happens in a book. However reading this book I found myself thinking that I shouldn't get attached. Then I was thinking wow just like in a real apocalypse where you fear attaching to someone who you may have to kill. So I feel that it was a good thing. It kept me there in the midst of things. For the most part I think the author was pretty accurate with character portrayals, especially Ashleigh. With both books I was reminded of the Walking Dead tv show though they were written before the tv series."}, {"userName": "Netanella", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1157679-netanella", "userReview": "I haven't read After the End yet, so this is my first foray into Dee's zombie romance fiction. Dee does an admirable job in combining the two genres - heavy on the zombies, light on the smexiness. With the country backdrop, there's lots of agrarian action - bovine decoys, threshers, cornfield action, eighteen wheelers - in short, lots of fun. Highly recommended and enjoyable. Now I need to find the first book!"}, {"userName": "Theresa Hatem", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14690503-theresa-hatem", "userReview": "I finished this book last night as part of a two book bundle from amazon. Both books were good and I hope there are sequels for both of her books. This one seemed to have more character development and less action until the end.

Seriously zombies and romance? I'm in heaven. The best of two worlds. The two main characters take turns by chapters narrating so it's nice to get the male and female view. I so hope another is planned cause it left it open ended."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3894624-mel", "userReview": "I read one other book by Bonnie Dee.
