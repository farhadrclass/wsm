jungle and finding himself succumbing to his primal instincts. This one is a bit different. The protagonist Thomas, loves butterflies. I mean he really loves butterflies \"When he caught sight of his first Morphos, their blue wings shining in the sun like stained glass, he felt a familiar stirring in his trousers. This was something he couldn't explain and had long ago given up trying to. Ever since he was a young lad, his body had occasionally--only occasionally--reacted this way to the excitement of spotting and catching butterflies.\""}, {"userName": "Marianne Elliott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/229257-marianne-elliott", "userReview": "It took me a while to find a way in to writing a review of this wonderful book. I felt that the fact that the author is one of my most treasured friends might be influencing my objectivity and yet, I knew that this was a great book. It is a good read, but I also think it is an important book, one that challenges the reader to face unpleasant truths about our flawed human nature and one that addresses a question that I believe we each must answer for ourselves in the face of the terrible injustice in this world.Part of the strength of this book comes from Rachael's ability to write characters who, despite their many flaws, are compellingly real and who somehow elicit our empathy. In these characters we see something of ourselves and - most importantly to me - we are forced to confront the choices we ourselves make to either remain silent or to speak out.For me this is the heart of \"The Sound of Butterflies\", the terrifying choice to speak the truth. As a human rights lawyer I may have read my own story into Thomas's but whether or not other readers see it I was struck by the accuracy with which Rachael describes the paralysing burden of knowing unbearably terrible things. Here in Afghanistan I struggle with the temptation to stop trying to communicate the terrible things I see here to those I love, I consider choosing silence. In this context \"TSOB\" strikes me as being one of the very few novels I have ever come across that explores this very struggle, and I wonder whether it shouldn't be recommended reading for the many stay-at-home partners of humanitarian workers.By the way: I feel all the more confident in my assessment of \"The Sound of Butterflies\" now that it won the NZSA Hubert Church Best First Book Award for Fiction. Here is what one of the experts from the judging panel had to say \u2018Rachael King\u2019s strength is her rich, lush and sensuous prose; she has a forte for depicting characters we feel compelled to empathise with,\u2019 says Dr Millar. Yeah - what she said (actually I had come up with the point about empathy all by myself!).

Things start out fine for Mr. Edgar and his three companions: George, Ernie, and John. Catching wonderful specimens, and ever on the look-out for what will be his prize catch - his Papilio Sophia. A yellow and black swallow-tailed butterfly.In their travels of scientific exploration in the jungle's of Brazil, they meet Mr. Santos, a seemingly harmless man in the rubber business. Harmless, at first, that is. He takes them to his home in Manaus, and that, I think, is where things truly begin to unfold completely for Thomas.This was such a wonderfully written book I hated to finish it. The chapters alternated between Thomas's time in the jungle, and Sophie's (his wife's) time in Richmond, England - taking place in 1904, Ms. King's lovely writing transports the reader there with her interesting, likeable - and some not so likeable characters. It was very interesting to see this story unfold along with Thomas's horrifying secrets and Sophie's struggle to cope with a man that resembled her husband, who had changed drastically by his return.The story begins with Thomas's return - he is mute, and has alarming red welts on his body. Sophie tries her best to get Thomas to speak but has no luck after trying everything she can think of, which finally drives her mad enough to drag his crates full of specimens he'd collected while away, outside to burn them, which actually, finally does get a response out of Thomas. I was so glad for that, because I was beginning to go a little mad at his not speaking right along with Sophie. Due to the fact that in the chapters of his time Brazil, pieces are revealed, but nothing quite yet that was the cause to push Thomas over the edge. It was as if I were finding out with Sophie the darkest secrets he had been keeping. With an ending that was truly shocking - and heartbreaking, this book may prove haunting for days after reading it."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2385658-hannah", "userReview": "The premise of The Sound of Butterflies was incredibly promising: a scientific expedition through the Amazon, paralleled with a deep mystery to be solved on explorer Thomas Edgar\u2019s return to England.Unfortunately, what could have been made into a thrilling, complex drama by author Rachael King, is fairly placid for the most part. It\u2019s a little like Heart of Darkness meets Anna Karenina, but without the resonance of either. Actually, maybe that\u2019s not quite fair. There are some very strong moments of gore in those 353 pages, and a few grotesque murders that have certainly seared an image on my brain!However, much of it is slow, especially the first 150 pages where the pace really lags. If you\u2019re in a rush, you could probably skip a lot of it, particularly the present day chapters in the first half of the book. This is the main issue I had with King\u2019s writing: what plot there is unfolds quite quickly in places, presumably leaving the rest of the novel for character development, but unfortunately it\u2019s hard to feel an attachment to any of her characters. They\u2019re either evil or dull, take your pick from that.As it moves on though, King introduces some heavy issues: racism, abuse, sexism, power \u2013 all hot topics that blend quite well into the one story.This novel did grow on me. I can\u2019t say I particularly enjoyed it, but after coming close to chucking it out the window after just an hour of reading it, it at least gave me something to think about, was mildly entertaining for a few hours, and a fairly easy read.Originally published on www.thislittlethought.com"}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2348776-sue", "userReview": "I came across this gem on the bookshelves of the holiday home we rented this week.

It's a beautifully written page-turning mystery that eloquently describes the weirdness and horrors of life for both the Europeans and the Amazon Indians, in the rubber-boom years, when an opera house was built in the middle of the jungle, furs were imported from Europe, and horses drank from buckets of champagne.

In all my young days chasing butterflies among the wildflowers, the butterflies never once made a sound. They weren't like moths at the window or the buzzy bees, nor chirping birds or the wind through the trees. Not even close. In fact, their silence added to their mystique and beauty.\"Dear Sophie, We have finally reached Manaus and are now being accommodated at the home of Mr. Santos --- a man who has so far proved to be full of surprises, as has the city itself.\"Sophie eagerly gets this letter from her young husband, Thomas Edgar. She's in England at home, and he's in Brazil, finishing an expedition to collect, well, butterflies --- ahem, more precisely, to collect especially an elusive butterfly, a unique out-of-balance one. One he can name after her. It's 1905.So begins The Sound of Butterflies, a debut novel by Rachel King. We are introduced right off to the beautiful, but frail protagonist, Sophie, her love interest and young, na\u00efve husband, Thomas, and their creepy adversary, Mr. Santos. And it seems somehow each of these characters represents more than just themselves. Where are you in them? Where are any of us? For me, it is there but remains like the notion of the sound of butterflies vague.It's compelling to have an exotic and historical setting. In this case, it's the gratuitously exploited wilds of Brazil over against the stilted, self-righteous England of the early 20th-century.So King gives us this nice recipe up front and then puts it together and cooks it. But whatever it was supposed to be, it burned and lost most of its taste for me. Thomas returns. Or does he? He is bruised and beaten, torn and broken, but, most of all, mute and irresolute. The narrative mixes it, moving back and forth between England in the present and Brazil in Thomas's past, as Sophie and the readers slowly discover what is happening and what has happened to Thomas. And, it seems, Thomas comes around and so does Sophie. But then, I found myself wondering just what had happened on the macro scale? It has to have been more than just the story of Sophie finding out about Thomas and Thomas finding out about himself. A single butterfly doesn't make a sound, does it? Throughout, I couldn't help but wonder about the sound of butterflies, what it might mean, what it might represent. A cloud of yellow and black rose before him like a small tornado, and a faint noise went with it--a rustling, like leaves caught by a wind on an autumn morning, or the shuffle of tissue paper on a desk. The butterflies made a round in the stillness; he had never expected to hear it. The cloud dispersed, joining mates on tree branches that bent under their collective weight. Each specimen was as large as his outstretched hand.This central image didn't work for me. A small tornado with a faint noise? No! Rustling like leaves caught by a wind in autumn. Perhaps a little closer. The shuffle of tissue paper on a desk? Not in my experience. And even if these analogies did work, what does it all mean? What's its connection to the overall story? To not only our characters but to the world around them? Swirling in my mind is a notion that it is all somehow related to the oppressed and exploited masses, whether in England or in Brazil. Such can make about as much sound as a collective of butterflies deep in the jungle on a bent branch.Like Thomas, I came up somewhat empty-handed."}, {"userName": "Dyana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2729086-dyana", "userReview": "Thomas Edgar loves butterflies. He has heard about a mysterious butterfly that is half black and half yellow - this is an oddity as butterflies are always symmetrical. Being an amateur naturalist, he gets the amazing chance of a lifetime to join a group of scientists bound for the Amazon rainforest to collect specimens to send back to England. When he catches this special butterfly and catalogs it, he will name it Papilio Sophia after his wife and realize his dream of discovering a new butterfly.His fellow travelers are 1) George Sebel who studies zoology and entomology (insect collector); 2) Ernie Harris, a surgeon and amateur ornithologist (birds) and a skilled taxidermist; and John Gitchens who is a botanist (a plant-hunter). They all are flawed individuals and sink deeper into their flaws in the seductive and primitive jungle of the rainforest.Their benefactor is a rubber baron living in Manaus, Brazil named Mr. Santos. On the surface he seems to be an intelligent, jovial, and decent fellow who delights in spreading his money around. But underneath his largess, he has a dark, corrupt, and vicious side. They stay in his home for awhile - an outrageous display of wealth in itself - and experience the depravity and excesses of Manaus.When Thomas returns to England, his wife Sophie discovers he is mute and in shock and a shadow of his former self. Has he been driven mad by his quest for this illusive butterfly? She tries desperately to find out why he has been so traumatized and struggles to get him to talk again. She secretly begins reading his diaries and opening all the crates he brought home in an attempt to understand his new personality. The answer she discovers is a shocker and details the depravity and brutality he sees and experiences on the Amazon and thru Mr. Santos. The story is Juxtaposed between the social constraints of 1904 Victorian England and the primitiveness of the Amazon rain forest and the excesses of Manaus, Brazil. The story is told through narrative, diary pages, and letters between Sophie and Thomas. Sophie's best friend, Agatha, breaks through the period restraints and teaches her to be more confident and less frail as a woman. Sophie learns much about herself and her marriage.The author (1st book) paints a lush picture of the Amazon rainforest (so much so that I could feel the sticky heat and the bite of insects crawling up my legs!), the people, the rubber trade, colonialism, and the depravity and excesses it created. Her words paint rich sensuous pictures of both 1904 England and the sultry and dangerous jungles of Brazil.

There\u2019s a whole array of themes in this novel: a love story which includes betrayal and devotion, travel to colonial settings and the Amazonian rainforest, sex of various kinds, snobbery and shocking brutality. The main characters are Thomas, an amateur lepidopterist, who leaves his wife in Richmond (with her blessing), not long after they are married, to take the opportunity of the trip of a lifetime to Brazil with professional collectors. He returns emaciated and mute, to the shock of his wife Sophie. She must try and find a way to improve his condition and return him to his former health, and must take increasingly drastic measures in order to get a breakthrough. I really warmed to her as time went on. Through the backstory we find out why he ended up in such a state.

From his mysterious wounds to his inability or unwillingness to speak, it is clear that his travels were wrought with trauma and brutality. [return]It started out as a slow read, and I found it difficult initially to immerse myself in the identities of Sophie & Thomas. But before long, I was eagerly following the dual points of view, slowly discovering with Sophie the reason for her husband's frightening transformation, and reliving with Thomas the disturbing events of his time in the jungle. [return]The story is filled with acute & thorough descriptions of even the most insignificant details, mentally illustrating vibrant scenes and evoking complex yet common emotions. The Edwardian restraint of Engliand is smartly juxtaposed with the fierce primitiveness of the jungle, essentially creating two additional subtle yet fundamental characters in the story. [return]In the end, it is a tale of mystery, interspersed with love, deceit, brutality, and violent history. While it lacks some depth, skimming over points that might have added more interesting dimensions to the story, I found it a fast and entertaining read.[return]And thank you, Harper Collins (publisher), for the advanced reader copy & opportunity to review it early!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Defoy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1613620-jennifer-defoy", "userReview": "Overall I thought this was a good book. Rachael King has a way with words that paint the most exquisite landscapes. While there were many great aspects of this book, the best of them all has to be her command of language. The begining of the book seemed to take off slowly, more effort seemed to be placed on painting the landscapes as opposed to character development. However, as the book goes on the characters begin to take shape and the lack of explanation in the begining is seen as appropriate for the development of the story itself. I think that the book was very well written and the journey into Sophie, her husband, and the mystery surrounding his muteness was well put together. Never giving too much to give away the ending, but not leaving the reader wanting for more. This book also takes a dive into the human experience, the emotions and thoughts that lead to the actions that people take. Overall I would say this book was a good read. I didn't find myself not wanting to put it down, but while I was reading I was definitely drawn into another world, that of the rain forest and England. I would not say this is a re-read, but it leaves me looking forward to Rachael King's next novel."}, {"userName": "Devon Harper", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52134065-devon-harper", "userReview": "Several times in the five or so years I've owned this book I've picked it up, read the first eighty pages and then given up. This time I managed the whole thing and it was really not what I was expecting at all. I found it incredibly hard to sympathise with Thomas. He repeatedly talks about how sad and sorry he is for betraying his wife while not backing this up with actions. The first time, while he was not himself, perhaps I could've believed that he did love his wife. But he continued to betray her and from then on I found the whole story quite sad. I was expecting the big reveal of why he stopped talking to be a massive shock, but from around 60% of the way through I thought it was quite obvious what was going to happen in the Amazon to cause his 'illness'. That said, this is a very unique book, the past/present format works seamlessly and the author transports you to the Amazon really well, if you can deal with something sad and a bit strange at times then this is an enjoyable read."}], "description": "It is 1903. Thomas Edgar, a passionate collector of butterflies, is offered the chance of a lifetime: to travel to the Amazon as part of a scientific expedition. Hoping to find the mythical butterfly that will make his name and immortalise that of his wife, Sophie\u2014for if he finds it, he will call it the \"Papilio Sophia\"\u2014he eagerly accepts the invitation, and embarks on a journey that will take him to a whole new world.On his return, Sophie greets her husband at the railway station, and is appalled by the change in him: he is thin, obviously sick, and apparently so traumatised by what he witnessed while he was away, he has been rendered mute. As Thomas struggles to find the words to describe what he's seen, it's unclear whether or not Sophie\u2014and their marriage\u2014will be able to withstand what he has to tell her, for the story that unfolds, the story behind Thomas's silence, is one of great brutality. Like the butterflies Thomas is so obsessed by, the butterflies that he catches and kills, it's a story of men who have been dazzled by surface splendour and wealth, and consequently refuse to acknowledge its underlying cruelty. But when that cruelty ends in murder, the question for Thomas\u2014and Sophie\u2014is whether or not he should be the one to speak out.Written in rich, sensuous prose, and taking the reader from the demure gentility of Edwardian England to the decadence of Brazil's rubber boom, The Sound of Butterflies is a compelling and noteworthy debut.", "title": "The Sound of Butterflies", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104467.The_Sound_of_Butterflies", "average": 3.38, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356443474l/104467.jpg", "reviews": 159, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60376.Rachael_King", "name": "Rachael King"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104467.The_Sound_of_Butterflies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12341555-la-musica-delle-farfalle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6286779-the-sound-of-butterflies-rachael-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1840398.The_Sound_of_Butterflies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4776717-the-sound-of-butterflies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15748325-a-m-sica-das-borboletas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7176714-magpie-hall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13578741-red-rocks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30108838-der-ruf-des-schmetterlings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35909668-easy-alkaline-recipes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
