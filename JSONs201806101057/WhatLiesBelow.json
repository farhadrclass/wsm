After losing her husband in a convenience store robbery gone wrong, Gilly moved from Houston to a small town in Texas where she doesnt know anyone. Here she ends up finding herself involved in the kidnapping case of a young girl named Zoe. Gilly isn't like everyone else, she has dreams and premonitions and she just happens to see Zoe's abduction in a dream the day before it happens. The book is told in alternating viewpoints between Gilly and Zoe's dad Jake. Gilly's past comes to light throughout this book, as does Jake's romantic history. What Lies Below was a fast read for me, but I didn't get much of a thriller vibe from it even though I'm sure lots of people will. It was more of a mystery to me of who took Zoe, and what are the things from Gilly's past that she's keeping from everyone. The aspect of Gilly being a bit of a \"psychic\" (although she didn't consider herself one) was very unique, and I haven't read anything like this before. I personally found Gilly a bit frustrating at times, and I thought some of the characters didn't ask questions of others that seemed obvious to me. I also thought a few of the chapters had confusing endings that didn't translate well into the following chapters, but that might have been because it was an advanced copy. Despite these things I really enjoyed it though. Final Thought: Nothing really came as too much of a shock to me, and I only really remember having one \"whoa!\" moment, but I thought there was a very solid mystery contained in the pages of this book. There are definitely a few moments that will make some people's hearts race too, but that just didn't happen to me for some reason. I still definitely recommend What Lies Below to anyone that likes a book with a bit of paranormal-ish vibe (the dreams and premonitions) and a good mystery. It was definitely something different from all the other child abduction books out there.

This morning I decided to start What Lies Below and just read a couple of chapters. Here it is in the early evening and I have just finished the book after spending the entire day reading - cooking and cleaning can wait for another day! WOW - what a fantastic book. I was so invested in Gilly's life that I just couldn't stop reading.From the first page, the reader falls in love with Gilly. She has had terrible things happen to her - the loss of her husband and baby and the use of drugs and alcohol to help her cope. She has moved to a small town and joined AA to help her live her life but every day is a struggle. In the past, she has had dreams that came true and when her current dream of a child being abducted comes true, she has to face the skepticism of the police and her own desire not to become involved to help find the little girl. I can't say much about the plot without giving away a possible spoiler but I will tell you that the twists and turns keep coming and just when you think you have some answers, you find out that you were totally wrong.This is a fantastic book that keeps the reader turning pages to find out more about Gilly and to find out if the abducted little girl is found. I absolutely loved it and think that this fast paced thriller needs to be on everyone's tbr list. It's a MUST READ!Thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book to read and review.

I have had one Barabara Taylor Sissel old novel on my kindle for years, and I recently bought the audible copy of \"Faultines\", but didn't start any of the two simply because I thought they were \"just some probably good thriller\" as many others I read this year. In fact I read so many of them that I'm kind of bored of their similarities, their lack of depth, the big twists that doesn't shock anymore.I'm so sorry it took me all that time to read my first book from this author. Now I have to buy all the ones I don't already own and start reading them as soon as possible! I was amazed at how good is her writing, characterization, the depth of every thought and situation. I knew when I was less that 20% that I wouldn't be disappointed because when an author knows how to write you can love the story or not but you know it will make sense and the conclusion will be fitting to the story. I could have given my five stars review right from the beginning and I wouldn't be wrong. I also took my time to read it slowly because I wanted to savour it, particularly knowing the ending will be good so no need to rush there! I admit I am a slow reader but this is the kind of book that you can't read all in one day without spoiling a little the pleasure it will give you!About the plot, child kidnapping isn't usually one of my favourite themes but it was done so well it didn't bother me. The psychic topic also was not overdone althought I think people in real life would be a little less believing.. but I have to said I never tried telling someone I have precognition dreams! (luckily I don't!!!!!)So if that isn't already clear enough I completely recommend this book. I can't compare to others from the author but if you're tired of all that so called thrilles, this one is different, refreshing and so good!I would like to thank NetGalley, the publisher and the author for giving me ARC of that book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Barbara White", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8368378-barbara-white", "userReview": "I finished this gripping page-turner two nights ago, and every time I think about little Zoe's abduction, the adrenaline rush returns. This is a fast-paced thriller with heart. Gilly is my favorite kind of heroine: broken but brave (her premonitions were an added bonus). As she struggles with sobriety, grief, the past, her privacy, and heartbreaking mistakes, I fell for her big time. The multi-layered plot also weaves together two separate story threads.

What Lies Below is a breath of fresh air! It tells the story of a missing little girl, with the main character, Gilly, having vision-like dreams about where she is. She must decide whether to trust these dreams or if they are a mental product of her traumatic past. I was enthralled throughout and was along for the twisty journey, not knowing what was going to happen next.

There is some violent content but it\u2019s pretty non-graphic, and language wise there are a couple of instances of the F-word, but that\u2019s about it.I felt the author painted a wonderful picture of small town life in Texas. The descriptions of Wyatt, it\u2019s surroundings, and the townsfolk made me feel as if I was right there with them. The story is told from the POV of two characters with troubled pasts \u2013 Gilly (a woman who has a psychic vision of a pre-schooler being kidnapped from day care) and Jake (the father of the abducted child). Both characters are likeable, interesting, and you\u2019re really rooting for them to have a happy ending. I thought the author did a stellar job of showing that even those who commit atrocious criminal acts are not always essentially evil. It made a nice change of pace. Not that I don\u2019t love books with truly evil characters, with little, or no, redeeming qualities, but this read as more realistic and true to life. This was another book where I guessed who was behind the abduction, and why, early on, but I don\u2019t think it was that obvious, I just happened to catch the clues for once. And there were other parts, involving sub-plots, that were a complete surprise, so that was a plus. There were snatches of dialogue that didn\u2019t match the emotional state of the character speaking, but for the most part the dialogue was excellent and well-written. In a couple of places the author told us what was happening in one POV, and then in the next chapter switched POV\u2019s and had the character finding out what we as readers already knew from the previous chapter, which I think can work sometimes, but in this case it dragged out the plot too much. All and all an awesome book, by an author who is new to me, and one I will be reading more of in the future."}, {"userName": "Linda Zagon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9286778-linda-zagon", "userReview": "MY REVIEW OF \u201cWHAT LIES BELOW\u201d BY BARBARA TAYLOR SISSELKudos to Barbara Taylor Sissel , Author of \u201cWhat Lies Below\u201d for writing an intense, riveting, captivating, and intriguing novel with tremendous suspense.

Little does she know that her past will come back to haunt her and force her to face not only the day her life changed forever but also the current crisis of a little girl who desperately needs her help. Three years after her husband was murdered and the culprit managed to get away, Gilly is trying to rebuild her life working as a waitress in a small Texas town hoping that the murderer will never find her since she was the only witness to the crime. The thing about Gilly is that she sometimes has premonitions or dreams that occasionally come true as with the murder of her husband. A little girl who comes often to the restaurant where Gilly now works is abducted and her father is desperate to find her at any cost. It just so happens that Gilly had a vision of this happening but also cannot account for time lost while having the vision. She becomes a suspect and is desperate not only to clear her name but also find the little girl she has become so fond of. I enjoyed this book for so many reasons. I felt a connection with the characters of Gilly, and especially the father because of the way Barbara Taylor Sissel developed them.

But a young and innocent child? Would she be so off the rocker to think that way?Liz as she's known may just be far fetched as she's bi polar but she too has a human component and she too is suffering.With a attempted murder charge along with arson, with stolen meds from Lubbock Hospital, with the loss of a child herself ( Cassandra Marie) and the loss of parents to a car accident --- it all may be simply too much to keep her sane.As the premonitions become louder there is no other choice than to give them the attention they deserve and once that happens this story takes on a magic all it's own.I loved every aspect of this story and believe it will be a force to be reckoned with ...Thank you to Barbara Taylor Sissel, her publisher, NetGalley, and Aldiko for this ARC copy in exchange for this honest review."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8060484-linda", "userReview": "Thank you to NetGalley and Lake Union for giving me this book in exchange for my honest review.What would you do if you lost everything.

I wanted to keep reading from the beginning sentence to the very last one. The story pulled on my heart for the desperation of a father, Jake, who's daughter is kidnapped, to Gilly, who's life had been turned upside down by tragedy. She comes to the small town of Wyatt to escape the past and finds herself the in the center of suspicion of a kidnapping. Who can she trust? Can she even trust herself? Does she listen to the voices and dreams she's afraid to share because of judgement? Can she confront the past without the demons of self doubt taking her down? Does she want to keep going or give up? So many questions that kept me reading and reading wanting to know what happens and where it leads Gilly to. Even though she was trying to make a new start one line came to her in clarity.....\"You can't outrun your past.\" Now she had choices to make. There was so much suspense in this book. My heart was racing and I wanted to yell warnings. There were twists I didn't expect. This is a great novel. I haven't read any other books by Barbara Taylor Sissel before but I will eagerly read more. TY Netgally and Lake Union for the opportunity to read this book."}, {"userName": "A.J.

Barbara Taylor Sissel unerringly writes with great warmth and compassion for complex, damaged yet sympathetic characters. Her prose is vivid, poetic and peppered with beautiful metaphors. Infused with heart-stopping suspense, emotional resonance and startling imagery, WHAT LIES BELOW swept me along a river of urgency and dread. Barbara Taylor Sissel effortlessly weaves together prescience, regret, grief, love and revenge\u2014all wrapped in the mystery of a young girl\u2019s abduction. Beneath the breathless immediacy of the story lie deeper questions: how do we forgive ourselves\u2014and others\u2014for remembered transgressions, and can we ever break free of the past?"}, {"userName": "Stefanie Bevins", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75752872-stefanie-bevins", "userReview": "i love this book. I read it in 2 days, reading whenever I had a few spare moments during the day and then in evenings. Gilly has a great story, and it kept me guessing throughout the book. Was she involved, did she do it, etc? Jake, and his ex-wife Stephanie have an interesting back story as well. As the story continues, we learn in what ways Stephanie and Gilly have similar histories. Zoe, although a toddler, was the star of the show and very likeable. Throughout the book, I found myself routing for her, hoping that no harm would come to her. I recommend it as a quick suspense thriller with undertones of romance."}], "description": "Everyone has nightmares.
