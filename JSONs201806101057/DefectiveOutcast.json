By 2073 weapons and crime are a thing of the past, the planet is clean, the air pure and society is peaceful and living in perfect harmony. Society is ruled by one government known as the Commonwealth who are in charge of the commoners. The one exception to the perfect world in this time is a group known as the Outcasts. Young adults who just don't want to conform to society's rules. Outcasts have taken to the underground in the city to be who they want to be but some of them have been taken and when they return they become one of the perfectionists in the society no longer resembling their former selves. When one of these Outcasts, Kiara, turns up missing her boyfriend Dante is determined to find out where she is and what has happened to her. Starting off reading Defective it strongly reminded me of the movie Demolition Man which was about a society with no crime set in the future. This book however focuses on the group of teens that are rebelling against living in this society so it completely took on a life of it's own as soon as it started. I have to say if any complaints with this it would be that it is a novella so with it being short it could have always used a bit more expansion to the story and characters to really make it great. But there was enough here that I really enjoyed this start to the series. Such an interesting take on what a future society could be. Lots of little added things throughout to bring you into this futuristic world. Overall, a very imaginative beginning, I'm definitely interested in seeing where the author takes this series. A bit of a surprise at the end of this one I wasn't expecting so I'm curious as to where this will all go.

The idea of a futuristic society in which the creation of fully functioning real body parts for replacement is not far fetched. I can even work with the immortality. But this book doesn't adequately address things like population growth (even limiting to one child per family doesn't really work. There just isn't enough space or resources for that if everyone is immortal). I also have an issue with the whole concept of Outcasts. Mostly because they seem to be a bunch of criminals. Apparently all they're good at is stealing, breaking and entering, hotwiring cars. endangering others, destroying other people's property, disrespecting teachers, and doing a lot of drinking and partying. Not to mention they're jerks to each other and have a caste system based on money when they're an underground society fighting... equality? Which, okay, isn't really true. They're fighting for individuality, but they don't care who they stomp over to get it, because no one matters but themselves. It makes it almost impossible to care about what they're doing or to hope they get away. For brevity, I'll mention inconsistencies in the society, but not go into detail.Next, the characters. So Dante was a jerk. Yes, he loves Kiara, but that's about all he cares about and not in the romantic way. He's just a jerk to everyone he meets whether he deserves it or not. He's not sympathetic. In fact, I wanted to be in anyone's head but his. What a jerk. The others were partially developed, but sort of inconsistent. Dice seemed more like the ldeader. Doc seemed out of place. And I didn't see much point in caring about the others. And we never even meet Kiara! Never an in scne moment with her. Just a couple of flashbacks that don't make her much more endearing than Dante. There wasn't one I liked honestly.The writing was bad. Too much info dump, not enough in scene and when we did get in scene moments they weren't charged with emotion, but rather flat basic writing. It made me not care what was going on. I wasn't invested in anyone and there were too many inconsistencies in plot and world building to hold my interest otherwise.Spoilers below... sort of...Finally, when he gets taken.... They strip him and findle him, poke him, and explore his body's crevices and orifices. Meaning they rape him. And he barely complains. And there's no.mention of it later. This casual dealing with it... It really bothered me. Like this just wasn't a big deal, maybe because he's a boy? Which makes it trivialized and sends the wrong message. It really bothered me.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's a shame as I always hope for the best from new authors, but I can't say that this was anything more than the poor execution of a decent premise."}, {"userName": "Eshadi Sharif", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22311979-eshadi-sharif", "userReview": "I received a digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. However, this does not effect my review. All thoughts and opinions are mine and are honest. Rating this book was pretty hard so let me try to get my head straight. Firstly, this book needs a cover change.So the concept was actually pretty great-that's why I requested this book to review in the first place. However, it had some major flaws. The book was enjoyable to some extent. It is a quick and short read (took me a long time to read it thought since I got side tracked) and really fast paced. The story is packed with action-something is always happening. These are about pretty much all I can say that I liked about this book. However, it had more flaws than parts I liked. The writing fell a bit short for me. I could have called it a middle-grade book due to its simplistic style but there's swearing and some *cough* indecent (weird?) scenes. I also have to admit, I sort of cringed every time a character said \"F you\" ..I don't think there's a point in not saying the entire word. On the other hand, the characters are interesting and at times, funny. I pretty much liked every character EXCEPT the main character, Dante. Dante was a bit annoying for my taste.

This is a dystopian story that really shows how technology can make our lives better but at the same time destroys us.\nDefective is a story where technology was very very advance already. This is the time where people can use technology to lengthen our lives. Imagine yourself not getting old. Yeah, it\u2019s a little bit weird right and at the same time, really interesting on how did that happen. That\u2019s one of the good part in this book. You\u2019ll be able to know how people in the future might use the technology in improving our lives.The idea was really good though many loopholes can still be found here. I have a lot of unanswered questions that I\u2019m hoping to be answered in the next installment of the series.The characters are very plain. A lot of them don\u2019t have something special to like about. I also happen to not know Dante\u2019s girlfriend because all I have here is how Dante saw her as a person. If there\u2019s only a flashback where I couldThe ending kind of disappoint me because it looks like rushed and the main problem or Dante\u2019s aim was not solved. They only discover something about the Commonwealth but their main goal to find Dante\u2019s girlfriend was not met.The story is also short so anyone who would read this will only spend a day to finish the book. And somehow, this novel also scares me and I don\u2019t want something like this to happen in the future. Just a NO. Big NO!If the author can only rewrite this book and lengthen more the words and pages, put more scenes that would really improve the characters and tell me more about the world in the future and how it started and who are the people behind it, this novel will have potential to be noticed more and may become big someday.If you are intrigued on what kind of future this book will tell you, then you should read this and tell me what\u2019s on your mind about it.\nDisclaimer: I received a reader copy from the author via Xpresso Book Tours.BLOG POST LINK: http://bit.ly/2bTPQ22"}, {"userName": "Louise Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44564088-louise-johnson", "userReview": "In a life set in the future where people don't die and people are perfect.

Right from the first page, action is almost pouring out of it. The first few chapters are pretty jam-packed with information and action, which was a bit full on but I didn\u2019t mind it so much because it cooled down soon. I do love a good book that can pick me up right away. I spent most of my night reading it and picked it right back up when I woke up to finish it off which isn\u2019t something I do often.I thought the idea for the story was great, I really liked the idea of having such a perfect society (literally immaculate) and adding in a few people who are really just normal people (the outcasts) but mess up the whole rhythm of everyone else (the perfections). I couldn\u2019t have executed the idea better but there were a few things in my mind like that I would\u2019ve liked a bit more on how the world came to be like this seeing as it is set a good 67 years in the future. Also, I would\u2019ve liked to know a bit more about Dante and all the other outcasts relationships with the perfections in their lives like their parents or their peers. As you can probably tell, I didn\u2019t love that the books focus was very much on finding Kiara but I mean it\u2019s just my personal preference to know more about the history of it. The way the outcasts are treated reminded me a lot of Divergent and how the people who were Divergent were treated all because they couldn\u2019t conform and were different just like the outcasts. It also reminded me of the Mortality Doctrine series by James Dashner, I can\u2019t really put my finger on what exactly it is but it just made me think of it. It also reminded me of the Lorax because of how perfect and clean everything is except these people have plants. All the sanitation and purifying just made me think of it. So you might be able to call it a cross between Divergent and the Mortality Doctrine series and the Lorax but I don\u2019t think that would be entirely truthful because I thought the story was very original even when some aspects reminded me of others.All in all, I think if you enjoy what I\u2019d almost call alternate reality stories then you might just like this one a lot. I found it moved fast which some might like and others might not but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to give it a go. I don\u2019t think the story will really stick with me, it won\u2019t be something I think about at random moments during my day. I enjoyed it, would I read it again? Maybe not but while I enjoyed it, it wasn\u2019t quite my thing and usually you\u2019d have to write a damn good book to get me to read it again (cough cough Harry Potter). Would I read another book by the author? If I could get my hands on it, sure, why not? Defective was a quality story, not my cup of tea but I still enjoyed it and I liked that even though it\u2019s not the kind of story I usually pick up I still really enjoyed reading it and even managed get through it in under a day.I say, B. Austin, give yourself a pat on the back. You\u2019ve done a good job.*Side note, I loved the character Valentin!"}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52181489-nick", "userReview": "This book is so close. ***Spoilers towards the end*** The idea of a clean, perfect society with rebellious outcast trying to live in their pristine, character-less world has the potential to be epic. Then when you find out that outcasts are going either completely missing or kidnapped and returned perfect brings a new level of interest. It's a corrupt world or fake peace. With that being said, this book fell short. The characters were there but they lacked luster. Valentin was by far the most interesting. I would have loved to know more about Dante, Dice and Kiara. A little back story of their relationship, especially between Dante and Kiara. What sparked the die-hard love? For being only 16 and 17, the love between them is kinda weird and unfounded. I feel like all the characters should be older because of it. Moving to the storyline, the book just dove straight in. You are in this missing persons case in a world you don't know. Having a little bit more build up of the society and and the reason for outcasts would have helped to get my mind on the right page before I go on a missing persons hunt. Through the book you do get to know more about the society and tastes of outcast history, but still not quite enough. ***SPOILERS***There were a lot of scenes that didn't make sense or add to the story in my opinion. There is a scene where he is in school. Nothing is happening except a lot of environmental and other people description. I feel like this was just a reason to get him in lock-up, which could have happened anywhere. Him and Dice have been running around enough, being caught outside would have made more sense. Another scene was the fight between outcast borrows. I get that they don't like each other but it was really random, I don't know what caused it (maybe I over looked that) and it could have been really cool if it was more descriptive and didn't last 1 paragraph. The last scene was the random searches of the underground borrows for Kiara. What made them want to do that or brought them to the idea that she might be there? Again, all of this is my opinion. For positives!! Because there are always good notes. *** Still Spoilers ***The scenes and descriptions of Dante in lock-up were the best part of the book. The character Valentin was introduced and he is something else. The speech and attitude makes me want to know more about him and desire more scenes involving him. The lock-up environment was described well and was definitely needed for the ending of the book with Sebastian. So the tie in there was well worked and worth reading. The last 5 chapters were also well written. So much action and detail was placed at the just the right pace. No underwhelming or overwhelming. There were some random lines that didn't make sense but I got past them quick. I think that if more of the book was like the ending, I would have enjoyed it more. Maybe instead of 100 pages, we take the next 1 or 2 books and add them to this.

Dante is what is known as an Outcast. An Outcast is anyone below the age of nineteen and who are considered to be defective. A defective or Outcast is someone who will not conform to the rules of the Commonwealth. The Outcast just want to be who they are and not someone else or someone the Commonwealth say they must be. Outcast can dress however they like but they must wear the \u201cno symbol\u201d on their clothes. There is no Outcast above the age of nineteen.A lot of the Outcast has come up missing over the years. A few are returned to society conformed but some never return. If they are returned to society they are not the same people they once was. They no longer want to hang out with their bff\u2019s. They are now a part of the \u201cPerfections\u201d.When Dante\u2019s girlfriend Kiara disappears he makes it his life Priority to find her. He will break any and all of the Commonwealth rules to find her even if it means spending time in lockdown. Dante with the help of his friends as well as defective\u2019s from other Outcast groups start doing a little detective work that hopefully will lead them to Kiara and the other missing Outcast. But some are not quite willing to put aside their differences for someone that is not a part of their little group long enough to help out a fellow Outcast. They are only concerned about their own and most probably themselves first. Outcasts have their own secret place in the underground tunnels. Most Outcast do not get along at all but some are willing to put aside their differences long enough to find their missing people and to find out what the Commonwealth is up to. Defective is a very fast and enjoyable read. It grabbed me right from the beginning and didn\u2019t want to let go. I fell into the Outcast world and loved every minute of it. I loved the message that Defective had to tell us. I love reading books where the author has planted a message in the book. This kind makes for the best books to read and will leave you wanting more.

Austin5\u2728 starsTalk about an interesting dichotomy, the setting of this book is utopian to the majority of the people but to the Outcasts it is dystopian. This is the first book in this series with the main characters being Outcasts. The creep factor is high in this version of the world. The descriptions of the city; its streets, buildings, people and those watching and enforcing the rules make my skin crawl.This entire world is divided in many ways. Though everyone is supposed to be equal, except the Outcasts, NYC is divided with each of the Burroughs ranked by wealth or poverty of those living within. This book is both dystopian and sci-fi. The author did a fantastic job at creating this world and the people who live in it. There is much mystery about everything that isn't quite right in this world. This book doesn't end with a cliffhanger but the questions left unanswered will make you want to read the next book. What information is learned just leads to more questions.I would highly recommend this book. Even when it was creeping me out I was drawn into the story deeply enough to keep reading.

It is young, fresh and a real fun read. With \"big brother\" watching over everything, this book is really not that far fetched which adds more intensity to the storyDante is a nice lead character in this story that struggles with the events but stays true to himself and the ones he cares for. He is supported by a few nice characters like Dice, and some you are not yet fully sure which side they are one.When I read the last page I was left on a cliff hanger that left me wanting more.

It was confusing because of the way it is written and a few spelling mistakes. There are many places in the book where the wrong name is written, which makes it confusing. It will say something like \"From the corner of my eye, Dante...\" which is coming from Dante. It should have said Dice.Other than those few mistakes, the story is very interesting. Dante is an outcast, defective because he doesn't conform to society. The society is very clean and perfect. Everybody follows every law to the T. Cleanliness and peace are their main concerns. Then there are the outcasts who don't wear the required silver jumpsuits and stay underground where they are free to be themselves. They wear shirts with a no symbol, so everyone knows they are outcasts. More and more of the outcasts are being taken, but they can't figure out by who or where they're taken. When Dante's girlfriend Kiara goes missing, Dante makes it his mission to find out what's going on and to get Kiara back. The story is based on different classes of society in New York City. Each class is based on money. Dante is part of the Brooklyn outcasts which are a few below the Powerfuls, with the most money. Usually the classes don't get along or socialize with each other, but the search fro Kiara has brought them together.There are 2 aspects of this society that I thought were unique and I really enjoyed. The first being the 3D printers. They can print just about anything with these printers. Dice prints out motorcycle parts to put together and build a motorcycle. They can print food, books, gas, beer, pretty much anything. The second aspect is the ability to live forever by reproducing cells. Any body part that goes bad can be reproduced in minutes. Dante gets a few ribs broken after being in lockup and goes to his friend Doc to be healed. All he does is run a laser over his ribs and they are fixed. Then Dice gets his finger chopped off while in a fight with the Dragons. Doc makes a mold and fills it with stem cells, then a few minutes later it's as if his finger was never cut off. This technology would be amazing.All together this book is a decent read. If you can get past the confusing parts and mistakes, the story line is good.

Having recognized the damage done to the planet, humans have cleaned things up quite a bit. Technology has advanced to the point of immortality, failing organs being replaced by artificial replicas. The world has only one government. The Commonwealth goes to great lengths to ensure the laws are followed. Citizens over the age of 21 follow the laws unquestioningly and there hasn\u2019t been a violent crime as long as anyone can remember. The Outcasts are the exception. They dress and behave however they want, showing emotions other citizens are incapable of feeling. Outcasts either die or go missing by the time they are 20 years old.Dante is a member of the Brooklyn Outcasts, a group called the Bones because of the graveyard in their Underground hangout from back in the day when mobsters ran the area. His girlfriend, Kiara, goes missing on her eighteenth birthday.

Dante does everything he can to search for Kiara, even teaming up with other boroughs of Outcasts.After reading the description for Defective, I was excited to read it. At first, it was a bit hard to follow because the topic seemed to change pretty frequently but once I settled into the story it flowed pretty nicely. The story itself is very interesting and while I had trouble seeing some of the characters as believable, this may be due to the extreme difference in the society of a today versus the society created within the Outcast Series.

I genuinely believed this was a book set in 2073 and was completely immersed the whole time with the separation between the Commonwealth and the Outcasts. The broken up groups within the Outcasts that of course still went for each others' throats underground. The 3D printing and production in everyone's house. The flashbacks that seem inherent in each character. What details weren't given in the text were quickly populated by my mind. And at the same time, there was a strong thread of plot weaving throughout this narrative: Dante's girlfriend Kiara is missing from the start of the book, and Dante refuses to think that she might be dead. She's popular enough among other Outcasts that a wide search goes on, involving more and more people as the story takes place.The biggest thing I didn't like about this book, and didn't feel it did well, was character depth. We knew Kiara really well for someone who was missing. And I guess I feel as though I knew Dante from the fact that this was a first person narrative from his point of view. But everyone other character just seemed like plot devices. The story never paused long enough on any of them, for more than say a sentence or so, to delve into who they were as people, their own feelings or motivations. Even the traumatic flashbacks weren't explained, they just were.It had the effect of making the story seem rushed and a little incomplete despite its strong scene setting."}, {"userName": "Emmyjo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4035155-emmyjo", "userReview": "This book has to be one of my favorite's now.Just for the fact that it's crazy to think about.We learn that in the future people are perfect, they don't like those that think outside the box so to speak.People that are different are defective, they have to wear silver jumpsuits with a no red circle symbol on the front.

HOWEVER, I can shed light on the book cover. Dante, whose girlfriend has vanished, stands by a tunnel with New York City above him. Dante is a member of the Bones, which are the Outcasts from Brooklyn. The series is Dystopian and in this future NYC there are 8 boroughs and 8 different sets of Outcasts, each with their own secret underground.The year is 2073 and Earth is under one government, the Commonwealth. Everyone obeys the rules except for Outcasts who dare to be individuals, creative, and free thinkers. There are no Outcasts over the age of 19 and hoards of them have simply vanished over the years, leaving only 6,000 Outcasts, the minority in a city of millions.The Commonwealth considers itself a world of free will. Hence, Outcasts can dress as they please. However, they must wear a red No symbol on their clothing if they do not wear the required uniform for their age group. The No symbol marks them as Outcasts, meaning they are not wanted and warning the other Commoners, nicknamed Perfections, to avoid them.Right now, the series Outcast is planned for 8 books, along with some prequels. I plan to follow each book with the other and write as fast as I can.Thanks for reading this review."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22079809-josh", "userReview": "Dante is an outcast - a rebellious teen in a perfect work.

The price of immortality though, is conformity. To the Outcasts, this price is too high and their continued rebellion means friends start disappearing. This story follows Dante, an Outcast, and his search for his missing girlfriend. Friends and other Outcasts join Dante in the search for and investigation of missing teens. This leads to a shocking discovery ...B.
