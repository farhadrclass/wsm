Graham has a rare sleep disorder called parasomnia - in fact, their trouble sleeping was how Georgia and Graham met, at a sleep clinic they dubbed Detention - and during the rare times he does sleep at night, he sleepwalks and does strange things. After he crashed through a glass window at a hotel, he lost his position at the university and the neighbours spoke of how creepy the family was in the media. It was time to leave, and Graham had been offered a position at the university in Miami which seemed fortuitous, using his IT skills as part of a team researching hurricanes.Georgia had grown up in Miami, and her father lives there still, with his second wife, Lidia. Lidia's house backs onto a canal, and with his usual tendency towards recklessness, Graham proposes they buy a houseboat. They rename it Lullaby, and tether it to Lidia's dock. While Graham is busy at the lab, Georgia busies herself pruning Lidia's plants and looking after Frankie, who hasn't spoken or made little more than slight sounds since he was eighteen months old. They've taken him to several paediatricians and specialists, but still don't have a diagnosis or much of a plan to help him start speaking again. In an effort to help and keep Georgia busy, Lidia recommends she take up a part-time job as an assistant to Charlie Hicks, a man her father's age who lives in one of the fourteen houses built on stilts in the Bay of Biscayne, called Stiltsville. Georgia remembers Charlie only vaguely; his wife Vivian had been a friend of her mother's, who often had parties at the house when Georgia's father, a musician, was away for months at a time. But everyone knows the story, how they lost their daughter, how Charlie left to live in Stiltsville like a regular old hermit while Vivian's health deteriorated and she ended up in a nursing home. Charlie is a quiet man who prefers solitude, but with the help of Frankie, whom Charlie makes time for, Georgia develops a warm friendship with \"the hermit\", and greatly admires the painstaking artwork he creates.When Graham leaves for what was meant to be five weeks on board a ship with the rest of the scientific team in Hurricane Alley, to test their work, things change in subtle ways. Frankie starts to speak, and Georgia draws closer to Charlie and begins to see that there may be a connection between Frankie's selective mutism and his father's disturbing nocturnal wanderings. As news of a big hurricane - Hurricane Andrew - approaches, Georgia's decisions lead to the same recklessness she sees in her husband, and with an outcome just as terrifying.For the first half or so of this book, I was full of admiration and praise for Sea Creatures. The prose was clean and smooth and unpretentious, the story simple and equally unpretentious, with a focus on Georgia as a mother and wife, trying to find her way and get some firm footing. Yet towards the end, it became more eventful, and the events that occur were not, I felt, in keeping with the tone of the rest of the book. It all got surprisingly melodramatic, and this drama - or we could call it \"Georgia's decisions and their predictable fallout\" - overshadowed and let down the strength of the book as a whole. Perhaps if there had been less foreshadowing from Georgia herself, who narrates from the perspective of, I think it was, eight years into the future, it would have read more naturally. And perhaps if Georgia were less aloof from the reader, someone I could understand and relate to better, her choices wouldn't have seemed so ... tacky. Because I did find that the big drama around the time of Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 was almost cheesy in the way it was presented.Georgia narrates in an omniscient, carefully-crafted storytelling style. She shares inside information about Graham and his childhood, for example, as if she were an author writing a story. It's a bit odd at first, but her ability to shed light on others adds a great deal to the depth of the story, which focuses on the characters and their connections to each other, their secrets and their desire to live a life of their choosing. Each character has the feel of a carefully crafted doll or game piece, each from a different game but occupying the same playing board, moving around like little islands, sometimes gently bumping into each other, sometimes connecting and sticking, like magnets, until something should pull them apart. I don't know how else to describe it, but that was how the characters move through this book. And for the most part, I really enjoyed it.The dynamic between Georgia and Graham and Frankie is at the heart of the story, and Georgia's increasingly unflinching analysis of her marriage and the relationship between Frankie and his father is the main point of the whole novel. Everything that happens is a catalyst or an influence or a bump in the road on this journey of Georgia's. I could relate to Georgia in some ways, as we did have a few things in common - mostly a toddler - but Georgia is an over-protective, second-guessing, hovering sort of mother, so afraid that she's a bad mother or the reason Frankie won't talk that her ability to clearly reflect on her own parenting style or her decisions is clouded by this anxiety. There was no real sense of chemistry between Georgia and Graham, not in how Georgia relates their relationship's early years, though I found Graham to be one of the most interesting characters in the whole novel. Far from black-and-white, Graham both loved his son and was impatient with his speech problem. He was considerate towards him but never really wanted to spend the quality time with him. Likewise, Frankie both adored his father - as all small children do - and feared him. It was Graham I pitied the most, though, when all was said and done. He came out the victim, in the end, I suppose, considering there was nothing he could do about his sleep disorder or what it made him do, the rare times he actually slept. There is another character in this novel, one that Daniel clearly has a keen interest in: Stiltsville itself. Her first novel, Stiltsville, was set there as well, and it features prominently in Sea Creatures. In fact, the setting of Miami - which comes across as a small, somewhat sleepy town - as well as Stiltsville comes across strongly, and was one of the things I enjoyed most about this novel. I've never been to Florida, but the area in all its heat and reptilian glory came vividly to life.The theme of sea creatures, too, was a rather beautiful one, and nicely incorporated. The obvious representation was in the artwork that Charlie Hicks creates, but it radiates out into Frankie's delight with snorkeling and the little sea creature toys Charlie gives him and the paper mobile he makes for him, as well as the scene in which Graham rescues a giant turtle from a lobster net (sharks had already bitten off one flipper). There's the woman who lives across the canal from Lidia who often dives into the alligator-infested waters for a swim (in fact, \"recklessness\" could be another theme of the novel), and the sense that the human characters on land are their own kind of creature, the way they're presented. (Coming back to that analogy from before, of the pieces from different games - different species - all occupying the same game board, in the way of sea creatures occupying the same sea.) There's something poignant and tender and genuinely heartfelt about the sea creatures, and it's also a way into understanding Charlie and humanising him.I have a lot more to say about this book - it would be ideal for a book club discussion! - but my reviews are always too long so I need to wrap things up. Overall, I did like this book, I liked it a lot, it was atmospheric and felt authentic, realistic, without ever being dull. It was easy to become emotionally invested, as a silent, unobtrusive observer, and it was a story I was interested in. But the drama of the ending (not the actual end of the book, but the climactic events that signal major shifts and an ending to the story of that summer) was like an off, jarring note in an otherwise lovely musical performance. I was amazingly disappointed in how things went, because up until then this had been a wonderfully captivating, well-written story.My thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book via TLC Book Tours."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9962199-melissa", "userReview": "When will I learn! \"Literature!\" Another theme done to death - married mid-30s white woman of upper-middle class liberal background with child just can't seem to grow up, frets about child, whines about it for the entire book, and looks for new love because her husband isn't exactly what she wants now.

Ms. Daniels brilliantly captures the full range of emotion that comes with parenthood \u2013 the complete devotion, the frustrations, the constant worry, the fear, the love, and so much more. Georgia\u2019s worries are every reader\u2019s worries, so strong is the evocative language, just as her failures resonate a bit too close for comfort as they provide a stark reminder of just what can happen in spite of one\u2019s best attempts. Every mother knows that it is impossible to protect her child from all possible ills, but that does not stop one from trying. It makes for a beautiful story, if uncomfortable at times because of its accuracy.Sea Creatures does not just shine from the emotional depiction of parenting; it also showcases the ambiguity of real life. Ms. Daniel does not use omniscient narrators, so that a reader only knows what Georgia knows and must speculate the rest \u2013 just like in real life. It is frustrating but so effective in establishing uncertainty and suspense.Another item of brilliance is how Ms. Daniel does not let the hurricane overshadow the drama occurring among her characters. It would be all too easy to let the hurricane become the story\u2019s focal point. Instead, it is nothing more than the backdrop in front of which the rest of the action occurs. This deliberate lack of emphasis on a life-altering storm solidifies the character-driven action of the story and again mirrors life, as Georgia\u2019s focus is not on the weather but rather solely on her son. When it comes to a mother\u2019s love and worry, not even Mother Nature\u2019s fury is a distraction.Sea Creatures is a haunting, thought-provoking story about motherhood and marriage, the compromises we make for spouse and/or child, and the consequences of them. Ms. Daniels\u2019 superb writing personifies every mother\u2019s fears through Georgia\u2019s own struggles to do right by her child while balancing her own happiness. It is an amazing story that will evoke a torrent of emotions and leave a reader breathless."}, {"userName": "Roxane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane", "userReview": "I loved this book.

This book pulled me in from the beginning, with phrases like \"the steeped-tea sunlight of early evening\" catching my eye as early as page nine. In Sea Creatures, Georgia tells her story about her disrupted life after her husband Graham, who suffers from parasomnia, has an incident that costs him tenure and leads to them leaving Chicago in disgrace. To make matters worse, their son, three year old Frankie, has stopped speaking. Most of the character details in this book are fairly eccentric. Georgia's father is a lifelong musician, wandering from band to band, Georgia herself chooses to work for Charlie, an artist but also a hermit, and Georgia and her husband met because they both suffer from insomnia and encountered one another at a sleep clinic. Yet Georgia draws attention to and reflects on how others view her and her idiosyncrasies, saying \"we were referred to as 'eccentric neighbors,' which I never understood. Surely, to be labeled as such, there must have been something other than Graham's parasomnia. Did it have to do with the fact that I hadn't grown up in the area? Was it Graham's prematurely white hair, his all-season bicycling and refusal to drive a car? Was there something about us I didn't recognize, some odd mannerism or behavior? It was more likely sloppy reporting than anything else, but still, I was humiliated\" (138). I like how introspective and vulnerable Georgia seems. She does not seem to take anything about herself from her mother's opinion of her to what kind of mother she herself is for granted.The character that remained the biggest enigma for me was Graham. I never understood what he felt for Georgia, why Georgia was interested in him, or even what Graham was studying in terms of weather patterns. In addition to his odd behavior brought on by his sleep disorder, Graham is reckless and seems to care little for his son. It seems as if a critical juncture in their marriage is reached when Graham and Georgia make different decision while kayaking in the Keys. Graham wants to press on, even in the face of an oncoming storm, while Georgia decides to go back. Motherhood has made her more cautious as she she says \"the stakes, [...] they're higher now\" (130). Georgia reflects on how they have diverged and how their marriage has changed, \"For years, I'd trusted him nearly blindly. Life with Graham had always been filled with small excitements, like walking the frozen lake behind the cottage as the ice groaned and cracked under our feet\" (130). Although Georgia claims to reserve judgment about her marriage until later, it seems as if her choice that day spells out her later actions. However, this book lost steam for me after the first half. The central conflict - what caused Frankie's mutism and what Georgia is going to do about it - seems like not a conflict at all. In a few pages, Georgia shuts the book on that story line, and abruptly decides her course of action, with seemingly little reflection, which seems out of character for her - \"What happened next, I'll tell quickly, because it's difficult for me to do any other way\" (223). Georgia abruptly decides that her sin was marrying a reckless man, and choosing to have a child in a reckless home. I liked the title's relevance to the setting and plot of the novel, and it centered in until the end, with the force of Hurricane Andrew that sweeps through the landscape. Harry, the recluse Georgia works for, is an artist who draws different sea creatures, Harry gives Frankie plastic sea animals to play with throughout the book, the novel is set largely on the ocean or on a houseboat, and hidden demons are confronted. Yet the ocean's involvement in the conclusion of Graham's tale was perplexing to me. It seemed not only slightly improbably but Georgia seems largely unaffected by it. While the writing style and characters of this book drew me in, the lack of coherence of the plot prevented me from awarding this read more stars."}, {"userName": "Jaime Boler", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6103494-jaime-boler", "userReview": "Georgia, Daniel\u2019s main character and sole narrator, was a protagonist I not only liked but with whom I sympathized and empathized. I put myself in her place and understood the great weight she carried on her thin shoulders. I absolutely hated Graham, Georgia\u2019s husband, who suffered from parasomnia, a condition in which he experienced an erratic sleep pattern. He sometimes sleepwalked. \u201cSleep was the yardstick by which all other fears were measured, and everything else dwarfed. It\u2019s the stuff of horror films, sleep terror, but the sleep goblins of film are imaginary. Graham\u2019s problems were real, and all the more alarming for their unpredictability.\u201d SeaCreatures_3DBookshotDespite having parasomnia, Graham scoffed at his son Frankie\u2019s selective mutism. This, I must confess, was the ultimate of his transgressions for me. Graham seemed to want Frankie to be \u201cnormal,\u201d when Graham himself had medical problems.Daniel expertly underscored how parenthood can change a marriage. Georgia just could not understand her husband\u2019s mindset, \u201cSometimes I thought that in becoming a parent, I\u2019d morphed into an entirely different person, while he\u2019d remained exactly the same person he\u2019d always been.\u201d As Daniel\u2019s tale progressed, husband and wife only withdrew farther and farther away from each other.Georgia and Frankie, though, grew even closer. Frankie stole my heart time and again in this novel. \u201cJust as he\u2019d started to speak words, he\u2019d stopped\u2026[The doctors] quizzed me about my marriage and about Graham and his parasomnia, which led me to understand that children in difficult homes sometimes go mute\u2026.\u201d Frankie finally found his voice thanks to Charlie the hermit.I loved the transformation in which Charlie\u2019s character underwent. Like Frankie, he discovered a part of himself that had been closed off for years. Sea Creatures came to dazzling and vivid life whenever Georgia and Frankie visited Charlie in Stiltsville. Those passages just hummed with energy.683af41910938771f187ff55921f44d6I could not help but hope that Georgia and Charlie would develop a lasting romance. Of course, I also hoped she would give Graham the boot. Everything comes to a shuddering climax as Hurricane Andrew approaches South Florida, lending a threatening, uncertain atmosphere to the story: \u201cThe course of a life will shift\u2014really shift\u2014many times over the years. But rarely will there be a shift that you can feel gathering in the distance like a storm, rarely will you notice the pressure drop before the skies open.\u201d Indeed, the hurricane heralded a new chapter for Daniel's characters. For them, everything changed. Just as residents of South Florida cleaned up after the storm, the people in Daniel's novel must pick up the pieces of their tattered and torn lives.Thus, Daniel adeptly weaved together various conflicts throughout her narrative, cleverly moving from man against man to man against himself to man against nature. The plot of Sea Creatures expertly revolved around these struggles.All in all, Daniel\u2019s second book was an absorbing, lyrical journey. Sea Creatures left me spellbound, sleepless, speechless, and completely oblivious to the rest of the world."}, {"userName": "Gayle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241108-gayle", "userReview": "Full review here: http://everydayiwritethebookblog.com/...Sea Creatures by Susanna Daniel is one of those books that makes you feel lonely while reading it. I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way; it\u2019s just that there is a lot of sadness and isolation in this book that permeates even the experience of reading it.Sea Creatures takes place in Miami, like Daniel\u2019s earlier novel Stiltsville. Georgia and Graham Quillian have moved to Miami from their home in Chicago, along with their three year-old son, Frankie. The family has undergone a lot of stress: Frankie has stopped speaking altogether, and Graham, a parasomniac, was forced to leave Chicago because of some incidents that occurred at night while he was sleepwalking. His extreme sleep issues have put a tremendous strain on the family, but they\u2019ve decided to start over fresh living on an houseboat on a canal outside Georgia\u2019s father and stepmother\u2019s house.The first half of the book establishes Georgia and Graham in their new home, and explores their past as well as Frankie\u2019s selective mutism, which Georgia has learned to accommodate. As she gets to the heart of why Frankie no longer communicates verbally, Graham becomes increasingly resentful of her enabling Frankie and, as he sees it, continually choosing Frankie over him. Their marriage becomes more and more distant, to the point where he takes a months-long job on a ship studying hurricanes, and Georgia starts working for an older man with his own troubled past with whom she develops a complicated relationship.Ultimately, Sea Creatures is about parenthood - sacrifices we make to keep our kids safe and mistakes in judgment that sometimes have ramifications far beyond what we feared. There is a lot else going on in Sea Creatures: a lot of sadness and death, marriages and divorce, and the hugely important roles played by Miami and its distinctive weather and neighborhoods and Graham\u2019s sleep disorder. It\u2019s a sad book, for sure, but it\u2019s also rich and thought-provoking. I found it lonely, I think, because so much of it takes place in Georgia\u2019s mind. She kept so many of her feelings to herself, and bore the burden of many difficult things going on around her. She was frustrating at times \u2013 for someone who was so in touch with her son and his needs, she could be oddly lax about things like vaccines and the need for pre-school \u2013 and made some choices that were clearly not well-founded. But of course, that\u2019s what propelled the story and made Sea Creatures the engrossing story that it is.So, if you\u2019re looking for a melancholy, moody read that will also make you want to move to Florida and live on the water (something I\u2019ve never been interested in doing before), give Sea Creatures a try. Just be prepared to feel a little lonely. Incidentally, I think Sea Creatures would make an excellent book club choice \u2013 lots to discuss here."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/657072-elizabeth", "userReview": "The writing style of this book is appealing and immensely readable. The story covers the subject of family intimately. South Florida is also prominently on display. This is the South Florida of houseboats, extreme heat, Coral Gables and well, regular folk. We follow Georgia, Graham and their son Frankie fresh from failure in Chicago back to her hometown, Miami. Graham suffers a raging sleeping disorder and Frankie is a mute toddler, so there are some issues from the get-go. They\u2019re now living in a houseboat tethered in the backyard of her stepmothers home after failed careers and spent savings. Ostensibly, the story is the adjustment to this new life and the changes that occur. It\u2019s also the story of the complicated feelings that are brought when you move back to your home town. And these ideas develop nicely. But it also seems to be a story of the most dedicated mother in the world. Even when things go wrong, and they do, every ounce is focused on Frankie-but not about him as much as her focus on him. Yeah, he\u2019s mute but I guess I wanted the Universe to be bigger. I found I wanted to know about other characters more.That I cared one way or the other what happened is a testament to the enjoyable writing, I sped through the book quite easily. I think the actions of the mother should be characterized as not self-sacrificing to benefit her son but more along the lines of how to create one of the most self-centered only children on the face of the planet. To the extent that toward the end I wasn't really rooting for her or this new life she\u2019s created and thought some of the choices and revelations weren\u2019t liberating but at times, unfair. It\u2019s definitely a book written to appeal to a certain type of woman\u2019s sensibility.

Georgia\u2019s business has failed, and they have has endured a bit of scandal related to Graham\u2019s sleep disorder. To make matters worse, Frankie is selectively mute, a fact that has put additional strain on the marriage.

Given my love for Stiltsville, I was eager to see Daniel return to Miami with her second novel, Sea Creatures.\n The basics: In 1992,\u00a0Georgia's college admissions consulting business has failed. When her husband Graham doesn't receive tenure at Northwestern, they move back to her native Miami, where a friend of Graham's has offered him a job studying hurricanes. Their three-year-old son Frankie hasn't spoken for eighteen months, but there seems to be no medical reason why.\n My thoughts: I foolishly sat down to start reading Sea Creatures\u00a0before work one morning, and it was a struggle to not call in sick. One again, Daniel's writing captured me from the opening page. It's the first print book to capture me with writing and character since I read Curtis Sittenfeld's Sisterland last month.Georgia narrates her story from the future, which gives an air of importance to all of the novel's events. There \u00a0is also a poignancy to her story, one that perhaps only reflecting on the events yet to come for the reader. The result is a brilliantly plotted, masterful contemporary novel. When I turned the last page, I was in awe of how much Daniel fit into the novel. Each character, even the minor ones, are fully formed. Parts of the novel feel like an epic, as Daniel fills the story with past, present and future.\n Favorite passage: \"People speak of strength in times of crisis, as if strength were some great beast that swoops in to gird us, to repair our voices and limbs when it seems they might fail. But to this day, I don't know exactly what we mean when we speak of strength.\"\n The verdict: Sea Creatures is the best book I've read in 2013. It's a beautiful, intelligent, and heart-wrenching novel, and I hope it becomes a modern classic."}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "They fled from the home they had in Illinois, back to Miami where Georgia had grown up.

When Graham takes a job that keeps him away from them for weeks at a time, they can almost forget the problems. The niggle of doubt remains, however.Then Georgia starts working as an assistant for a man named Charlie. Nicknamed \"The Hermit,\" he lives in one of the stilt houses in the bay, and is an artist. Frankie accompanies his mother to the stilt house when she works, and soon is bonded to Charlie and loving the life on the water, as well as the sea inhabitants.As I read \"Sea Creatures,\" I was reminded of the previous novel, \"Stiltsville: A Novel,\" as some of the characters from that novel showed up in this one. I was also drawn into the watery world that defined these characters, the foreboding that precedes hurricane season, and the constant dread about Graham and the threat he might pose.Narrated in Georgia's first person voice, we learn about her, her relationships, and the family dynamics, as the story moves back and forth over the years.And as we follow along, there are questions that are slowly answered. Like why does Frankie stop speaking at the age of eighteen months? What events might have triggered this loss? How can Georgia help her son find his voice again, while still saving her family? What horrible event happens just before Hurricane Andrew that would change everything for her?The story begins by showing what has happened and revealing bits and pieces of the new life they are creating. But always there is that sense of foreshadowing. That feeling that something horrific will happen that will destroy their hope. The characters felt so real, and as I watched them connect and then disengage, I felt such a sadness, as if the losses were my own. An emotional read that will stay with me. Five stars."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281353-patty", "userReview": "Sea CreaturesBySusanna DanielI have always been a reader...a lifelong reader...but one of the first books I read as a blogger/reviewer was Stiltsville by this author. It was overwhelmingly breathtakingly lovely. It was laden with Florida history, it was character driven and throughout it was the ocean...the beautiful powerful scary ocean and all of it's amazing creatures. When I chose this book...I didn't fully realize that it was written by my beloved Stiltsville author! When I finally made the connection...I worried...I worried that I could not love it the way I loved Stiltsville. How silly and wrong I was! This is another book that takes place in Florida...Miami, actually. It is Georgia's story of her life with her young son Frankie...who is selectively mute...and her husband Graham...who has that horrible sleep disorder where you never sleep and where you do horrible things while you are in that sleepwalking phase. Graham has scared neighbors, caused damage and lost tenure because of this disorder. This family needs a fresh start so they return to Miami...where Georgia was raised. They buy a houseboat, Graham gets another research position, Georgia becomes an assistant to Charlie and they try to get the help that Frankie needs to begin to talk again.Charlie...older, hermit like, lives in a Stiltsville house...with secrets of his own. Georgia becomes his assistant. A few days a week she and Frankie boat out to his house with supplies. A bond grows between them. Charlie sees very few people but begins to love seeing Georgia and Frankie. Their relationship is complex but this book is laden with complex relationships. I am learning that Susanna Daniel's books have surprises...surprises that take your breath away...surprises that delight...and surprises that break your heart and make you sob...I loved this book. I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful it is. The characters, the way she writes...just truly wonderful. I know this is cliche but I didn't want this book to end and yet I couldn't put it down. It was beautiful...sad...lovely...beautiful."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "3.5 starsGeorgia Quillian, her husband and three year old son return to her hometown of Miami after some major upheavals in their lives. Her business has gone bankrupt, her husband has a major sleep disorder that results in him losing tenure at his college and her son doesn't speak. He communicates with sign language. They move into a houseboat moored on her dad and stepmom's property and try to start a new life.Georgia gets a job as an errand person for a local artist and her husband gets a job with a research project. Georgia is the epitome of an over-protective mother. She watches her son chew his food so he doesn't choke. She takes all kinds of protection and, yet, in major matters she doesn't protect him at all. She doesn't take precautions of a basic nature and he is hospitalized with major injuries during Hurricane Andrew. And the biggest problem her son has, lives in close proximity to him.The story works out in ways I could not have forseen and kept me interested to the last page. This was surprising considering how irritated Georgia made me. Her poor decision making power really grated on my nerves.

The setting was welcome and the characters interesting.I highlighted this, \"The course of a life will shift--really shift--many times over the years. But rarely will there be a shift that you can feel gathering in the distance like a storm, rarely will you notice the pressure drop before the skies open. That morning . . . I'd known on some level that this was one of those times. I would like to believe that I wouldn't again make the mistake of walking in blindly. Than again, blindly is the only way I would have walked in.\"I thought this wise and true when i read it on page 43. But I found the tragedy in this book to be overly foreshadowed and underly manifest when all was said and done. Her reaction to her husband seemed out of proportion and her son turned out to be fine. Since it was written in the first person, we hear alot of her inner musings, but it seemed like her inner world wasn't often revealed to those around her. The greatest tragedy was for her husband, a sympathetic character who takes the blame and pays the ultimate price."}, {"userName": "Sharyl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18117028-sharyl", "userReview": "I didn't know anything about parasomnia when I read this book, so I looked it up and there's nothing I found to indicate a person with this disorder can go days without sleeping. The book made it seem as if Graham did not require sleep for days at a time. In fact the info I read stated that parasomniacs should try to get a lot of sleep, using some of the tactics that Graham used such as a tether to the bed or alarming the doors. It seems to me that the author and therefore Georgia & Graham had not tried to do all they could to live normal lives with this condition. Maybe it's my ignorance of the disease and he had an extreme case, but this seemed to be one of the big issues in their marriage - On top of the fact that Graham did not want children and Georgia convinced him to have a baby. In addition, how na\u00efve was Georgia to think that her husband had not inadvertently scared Frankie during one of his sleepwalking episodes. Maybe she had been 'sleepwalking' her entire marriage.

BUT... (there is always a but with me)I read most of this book before I established a time period. It was not apparent to me that it was set in the early 90's and I felt like a dolt. I even went back to see what I missed and until Hurricane Andrew was mentioned I didn't see anything else. This annoyed me A LOT.Secondly, I didn't find Frankie to be believable. I have a three year old, and a very smart, vocal one at that, and that kid was not believable as a three year old. A five year old, yes? Three, no. This also annoyed me a lot.I also felt as though Georgia was very flippant regarding the situation with Graham at the end.

I read this book over a period of 24 hours. Its narrative pulled me along and I didn't want to stop.2. The best part of the book is the way Daniel is able to convey intimacies between characters. The conversations and ease between the main character, Georgia, and her friend Sally, her stepmother, and even Marse (from the first book, Stiltsville), are superb. 3. Georgia is multi-dimensional. She has faults and recognizes them in herself.4. I would love to read novels about the people Daniel imagines living in all the Stiltsville homes.5. I have qualms about some of the dramatic turns in the final third of the book.All in all, this is a satisfying and rich novel, a dear companion to the near-perfect Stiltsville."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "A family drama with slightly offbeat characters, this book is a satisfying read.

But the book certainly is full of action. The characters are really likable--even when they start off on the wrong foot in the story, in the end, there just are not any villains. The writing style is smooth, easy reading and skilled. If you are looking for a 'happily ever after' book, you might want to pass Sea Creatures by. There is a very dark element to the story even when most things wash out ok in the end. The author certainly ties up all loose ends just when the reader thinks there are some unanswered questions.

They have left Illinois trailing scandal and disappointment in their wake: Graham's sleep disorder has cost him his tenure at Northwestern; Georgia's college advising business has gone belly up; and three-year old Frankie is no longer speaking. Miami feels emptier without Georgia's mother, who died five years earlier, but her father and stepmother offer a warm welcome-as well as a slip for the dilapidated houseboat Georgia and Graham have chosen to call home. And a position studying extreme weather patterns at a prestigious marine research facility offers Graham a professional second chance.When Georgia takes a job as an errand runner for an artist who lives alone in the middle of Biscayne Bay, she's surprised to find her life changes dramatically. Time spent with the intense hermit at his isolated home might help Frankie gain the courage to speak, it seems. And it might help Georgia reconcile the woman she was with the woman she has become.But when Graham leaves to work on a ship in Hurricane Alley and the truth behind Frankie's mutism is uncovered, the family's challenges return, more complicated than before. Late that summer, as a hurricane bears down on South Florida, Georgia must face the fact that her choices have put her only child in grave danger.Sea Creatures is a mesmerizing exploration of the high stakes of marriage and parenthood, the story of a woman coming into her own as a mother, forced to choose between her marriage, her child, and the possibility of new love.", "title": "Sea Creatures", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248194-sea-creatures", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371569810l/16248194.jpg", "reviews": 332, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3447322.Susanna_Daniel", "name": "Susanna  Daniel"}], "type": ["Contemporary", "Fiction", "Family"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248194-sea-creatures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18662531-sea-creatures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18781336-sea-creatures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8692565-stiltsville"]}
