Ceremonial is a trove of writing which engages the sensual and the spiritual: where the body intersects with music, with pain, with God. These poems are frenetic and clear-eyed. To Miller, anything can be a verb, anything can be made to move.\"A kiss quicks a valley / of thirst, and Lord, never / let them thirst. / Must I saint / myself at the altar / of your thighs...\"from \"Ceremonial Psalm\"I highly recommend this collection."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6815705-ruth", "userReview": "I love the wildness of these poems. CEREMONIAL hums with bee-song and salt, whispered invocations and shoulder blades and the heat of stars. Carly Joy Miller is an original and unforgettable voice. I\u2019ll be thinking about these poems for a long, long time."}], "description": "Winner of the 2017 Orison Poetry Prize, selected by Carl PhillipsIn her debut poetry collection, Carly Joy Miller surprises and enraptures on every page. The visceral poems of Ceremonial figure the body at its most sublime and at its most feral, with equal attention. With an unflinching eye, Miller crafts psalms of petition and praise from the raw material of life.The poems of Ceremonial disturb in such a way as to make us entirely rethink who we are, and where. Ceremonial offers a post-apocalyptic landscape to be navigated by poems that together become a moral compass\u2014the compass Protean, however, ever-shifting, maybe trustworthy, and maybe not. Here, to bless a thing can mean to put an axe to it; the impulse to save what\u2019s broken competes with an impulse to look indifferently away from it; the topography is one of damage\u2014accident or what only looks, or is meant to look, like accident. And yet there is tenderness, too, and vulnerability. The poems variously revel in, regret, and feel strange compassion for the beast of desire\u2014of restlessness\u2014inside us all: \u201cStill I kiss / his jaw wild with yellow // jackets. I shepherd / too long in his furs.\u201d Part of the power of these poems is the coolness of their sensibility, a refusal to back entirely down: \u201cDon\u2019t blink in disbelief,\u201d we\u2019re told at one point, \u201cKill from the chandelier with a pearl strand. Swing the lights.\u201d I stand persuaded.\u2013Carl Phillips, judge of the 2017 Orison Poetry PrizeCarly Joy Miller\u2019s poems are wild, restless creatures. They scare me in the best way, balancing between pleasure and pain, and brokenness and wholeness, with lyricism, intelligence, and disarming composure: \u201cNothing delights more / than his horns. // How they rouge me.\u201d Reading Miller\u2019s thrilling debut, Ceremonial, I\u2019m reminded of what happens when something breaks: there\u2019s a brightness, more facets to reflect the light.\u2013Maggie SmithHere is the poet who knows the sensual art of speaking in tongues. [\u2026] \u201cTo be young and lopsided in faith\u201d\u2014not a kind of prayer one would expect from the young poet in any age, nevermind 2018. And, yet, here it is, the surprise of discovery. The new voice which is instantly recognizable as that rarest of occurrences: the real thing.\u2013Ilya Kaminsky, from the forewordThe current of language swept me up and carried me with seductive grace. I found myself rereading phrases, sentences, and entire poems, eager to experience again how the words were strung together. This fluid linguistic elegance seems counterintuitive, as there is something unbridled at the heart of these poems. They are peopled with spitfire girls in tune with the wilderness of their surroundings. There\u2019s an edgy magic to these characters and these verses, a fable-like quality that still captures the moxie and fire that simmers underneath female coming-of-age.\u2013Lauren Kane, the Paris Review blog", "title": "Ceremonial", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39280264-ceremonial", "average": 5.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1521052885l/39280264.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14016162.Carly_Joy_Miller", "name": "Carly Joy Miller"}], "type": ["Poetry"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39280264-ceremonial", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35858215-like-a-beast", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25588289-read-women"]}
