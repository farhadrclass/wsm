Anyway, as I was saying.I adore Ms. Wright and I have read and will continue to read every single book she writes. That said, this was not my favorite book in this series. In fact, it might actually be my least favorite to date. But, considering my \"least favorite\" is still weighing in at a solid 3-3.5, that's okay by me. They can't ALL be winners. Cause then there would BE no winners. Think about it. Anyexistential.I'm not sure exactly what I didn't love about this one. I guess I just found Gwen and her...situation to be a tad boring. Or maybe I'm just a shifterist and the fact that she was human failed to blow my mind. Who knows. Maybe I will enjoy this more the second time around. I do have a LOT going on at home right now and I find myself somewhat distracted when reading lately. GASP!I know, I know, crazy, right?But that's an indication of how many balls I have up in the air right now. Some are bound to drop.

I would expect no less of Suzanne Wright. She is one of my favorite authors and her books always hit the good spot. I will say that though I enjoyed this read something kept it from being a 5 star read for me. I honestly can't put a finger on what kept this read from wowing me but something was missing for me. I loved Gwen. I thought she was totally bad ass for a human. I liked Zander a lot. I didn't love him but I really liked him. I think I was a little put off that he was kind of standoffish to Gwen at the start. However when Gwen and Zander got together their passion was burning up my kindle. SW writes great sex in her books. I enjoyed the plot as well. I started this book and it kept me entertained the whole time.

I'm obsessed with these shifters and when I heard this book was going to have a human heroine I was ten times more excited. Zander is one of the quiet pack members, which drew me into his characters and made me want to find out all his secrets. I really liked getting to learn more about him and seeing him when he went all possessive with Gwen. She may not have Shifter strength but she held her own with Zander, and wouldn't let him treat her as a weak human. They had a strong connection from the beginning and their fighting each other only added to it and added some of that much loved sexual tension. Suzanne Wright having a human heroine in this series put a new unique spin on it and I was extremely happy with the new direction. I thought it was so different from her other books in that there was only one character who had the animal instincts, which made a big difference. It made it really interesting to see how Zander's wolf felt and then to see how Gwen herself was feeling about being with a shifter. There was a great deal of suspense and action featured as well and it had me on the edge of my seat from page one. Bad guys were coming from every direction making my heart race and then some ass kicking was going on. I couldn't get enough of everything and never had that moments where I thought there was too much going on. This author is one of my favorites and next time someone asks me why I'm just going to point them in the direction of this book.

She writes it...and I read it ;)I have read every book in the\u00a0the\u00a0\"Deep in your Veins\"\u00a0series, the\u00a0\"Dark In You\" series, the\u00a0\u00a0\"Phoenix Pack\"\u00a0series and of course the\u00a0\"The Mercury Pack\"\u00a0series. To say that I am a big fan of Suzanne Wright, would be an understatement.So when I saw this baby on Netgalley, I jumped on it :PNow all these books center around a different couple, so technically they could be read as a stand alone. I would advice everyone to read this series, and the Phoenix Pack series, in order though.I am so glad I did, because I really enjoyed it. Now I have to be honest here and say that I was hoping for Trick or Dominic's story to be next, but I found out they are next in line ;) Doesn't really matter anyways, because all these Alpha boys are fine !!!This time we got Zander and\u00a0Gwen's story.. the first shifter/human couple of both series !Zander is an enforcer for The Phoenix pack. He is the quiet broody type and I am happy to say that, unlike many of his packmates, he isn't a real big manwhore. This is mostly, because his wolf doesn't really appreciate female attention. So no crazy ex hookups in this one !!!Zander's uncle recently died and Zander has to be present for the reading of the will. This is what brings him to a small and \"haunted\" little B&B where Gwen works.Gwen was a pretty awesome heroine. Now I like most heroines in this series, because most of them are pretty kickass, but I really liked Gwen. She may have been human, but she was seriously badass and she could definitely hold her own !!Gwen is having some trouble though. Ever since she went to bat for a shifter, who was being abused by a bunch of humans, she has been the target of some serious harressment herself. This doesn't mean she is giving up though...it only makes her more determined to testify against them.Zander can't help but be drawn to this fierceful woman, even if she makes his wolf go into some kind of hide-out. All he has to do is win her trust...easy right ;)I loved how protective Zander was of Gwen, but I loved it even more, how Gwen stood up for herself. These two were extremely HOT, though I wasn't suprised by this, since Suzanne really knows how to write steamy scenes.There was plenty of action to keep me entertained and I finished this book in one go.I am not going into the story more than this, since I don't want to spoiler the book for anyone. I think this was wonderful addition to the series, and Gwen is definitely one of my favorite heroines in this and the Phoenix pack series.\n\n\n\n\nMy reviews are posted on DirtyBooksObsession"}, {"userName": "Aisling Zena", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18444439-aisling-zena", "userReview": "3.75-4 stars After three books it finally feels like a Mercury Pack book and not a Phoenix Pack extended book. It helped of course that no one from the Phoenix Pack made an appearance. This was strictly a Mercury Pack show even if most of it takes place away from their home.Gwen Miller is human. She and her family run a haunted inn that has a marsh for a backyard. She's a witness in a vile crime, an entitled teenager drugging and beating a female shifter, and she's being harassed over it. But Gwen wont back down and refuses to be bribed or intimidated into changing her testimony. Her need to do what is right and stand up for the shifter is ingrained to her very being. Zander Devlin books a room at Gwen's inn and is soon intrigued by her. When he finds out what she did for one of his kind he wants to help and keep her safe from everything and everyone. But she's not the only one that has troubles. Zander has his own bad childhood and nemesis that has shaped him and his wolf.Zander finds himself drawn to Gwen. Her strength and desire to do the right thing along with a set of killer legs are irresistible to him even if his wolf backs away at her presence. But getting to know Gwen and being with her is no bed of roses and our wolf has his work cut out for him.\n\"To have someone made specifically for you - someone who would never betray you, never hurt you, and would always cherish you- would be something special.\"\"Baby, why is it so hard to believe I simply want to know you? Why does there have to be some sort of technical reason for it? {..} I like what I know about you. I want to know more.\" \"Fuck, yes. I want you with me. I want you in my pack. I want you to be there when I wake up.\" \n Things as always with out wolves are not that easy. Gwen and Zander have enemies gunning for them as well their own personal issues to overcome. But again, as always they have pack and in Gwens case family to support them through it all.So why not 5 stars? Well, first because it didn't feel memorable to me. SW followed her pack formula faithfully and it felt just a teeny weeny samey (I hope the literary gods don't strike me down for my hubris.) And secondly because it lagged a bit in the middle. It felt a bit like spending time until we got to the big event/action towards the end(again, hubris.) But I loved absolutely loved the setting of the haunted inn with a marsh behind it and all the secondary characters in Gwens family. Particularly uncle Donnie. Give me a big Victorian house, tell me it's haunted and I'll be happy to read it. A great addition to the series even with the teeny tiny issues. **ARC courtesy of Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27276528-elizabeth", "userReview": "\u26054.5\u2605\n\"I want you with me. I want you in my pack.\"\nLure of Oblivion is the third book in the Mercury Pack. Although this is the third book in the series, it can be read as a stand-alone. The Mercury Pack is a spin-off of the Phoenix Pack and both packs are full of alpha male shifters and their sassy shifter mates. With each book release, I become more entranced by this world and believe me when I say I will never get enough. \n\"Baby...I couldn't give you up even if I wanted to.\"\n Gwen Miller is a human who has been thrust into a deadly battle. By trying to protect a shifter who was brutally attacked, she has put herself and her family in danger. When enforcer Zander Devlin checks into the inn where Gwen works, he is instantly drawn to her. Although it is rare for a shifter and a human to mate, it is possible. As Zander and Gwen grow closer, the battle between the \"shifter hating humans\" and the shifters continues to escalate. Gwen is in danger and Zander will do whatever it takes to keep her safe and make her his forever! \n\"I'm greedy-I want all of you. I want you with me every day and every night.\"\n Told in dual POV, Lure of Oblivion is another winning shifter read with passion, romance, action, and suspense. Ms. Wright has created a fantastical world full of complex characters living under intense circumstances. I found the human/shifter mating twist to be quite unique and as always with this series, once I started reading, I COULD NOT STOP!

Especially the Dark in You series. I truly love those. So when I started reading this book I had quite high hopes for it. Now, I wouldn't say it's a bad story but I also wouldn't say it blew me away. It's kinda in the middle. At times I felt bored but then again, there were moments where I really got into the story and the characters. I adored Gwen, she so to say saved this story for me. Zander was all right but I didn't feel the connection to him, at least not as much as I did to Gwen. Also, about his wolf, I'm not sure how I feel about him. At first I was confused and a bit weirded out but by the end, I don't know. The change happened a bit fast for me. The secondary characters were also great and I liked seeing the characters from previous books make an appearance in this book. I even liked the 'bad guys', they were sorta pathetic but also funny and at times they even made my blood boil, so that's a good way to make the villain.

IDK, there was just something missing. Gwen being human was a great twist on the true mates idea, but both her and Zander came across as a wee bit flat and one dimensional.

As long as she writes them, I'll read them!I love the world she created and the characters as well. This is one of my all-time favorite PNR series EVER. The formula works and I'm in love with it!In this installment, Zander meets his match! While I'm not a fan of the shifter human relationship dynamic, this one worked better than others. I think the combination of Zander being aloof and Gwen accepting that their relationship was only casual in the beginning helped make this more appealing. Normally, I'm all for mating in the first chapter, but the two of them getting to know one another helped.The book is action-packed, several former characters make an appearance, and the main characters are strong and independent. All major wins in my book.My only minor issues were the secondary characters/villains and the ending. The antagonists grated on my very last nerve! I know part of that is natural. But these douches just plain ol sucked. The violence towards the MCs at the end felt over the top and was a bit too much for me. I get it's fiction and these books are all violent, but having the human on human violence at the end just didn't sit well with me. It wasn't a major detraction, but I felt it was too drawn out.

To have someone made specifically for you\u2014someone who would never betray you, never hurt you, and would always cherish you\u2014would be something special.

This time though it's a story that features a very human heroine but rest assured there's still plenty of chest beating shifter goodness! Gwen is such a vibrant, ballsy heroine and right from the start it's plain to see that it would take a special kind of guy to match up to her. Gwen doesn't go quietly or back down and she's determined to see justice served no matter what she has to do. She might live in a haunted house but believe me her problems are very real indeed . It doesn't matter who threatens her Gwen won't let the female shifter down.Zander and his wolf are frequently at odds when it comes to females but he's never quite experienced his wolf acting the way he does around Gwen . Normally fearless and yet now withdrawing from the human woman is something Zander cannot understand. Still Zander can see that Gwen is a puzzle, a conundrum and he's not one to walk away when someone needs help even if Gwen doesn't quite appreciate his methods! I really liked both characters and it was an interesting situation they found themselves in. Plus the supporting characters added greatly to the fun although I was a little nonplussed by the ghostly intervention. There are truly vile bad guys for the reader to boo and hiss at and yet this isn't my favourite book in this series. I guess my problem is Zanders wolf as everything just seemed to change overnight. I can understand the wolfs caution and the explanation made perfect sense but from out of nowhere things seemed to completely change!

I absolutely loved the latest in Suzanne Wright\u2019s Mercury Pack! It is everything I want in a shifter romance.Gwen is being harassed after witnessing a lone female shifter being beaten by a group of human thugs. Although the female has recanted her statement, due to similar harassment, Gwen refuses to do so. Too many times has she had to keep quiet against injustice and she won\u2019t do it this time.When Zander arrives at the B&B where Gwen lives and works, his wolf instantly backs away from her. The wolf is wary and guarded and confusing the heck out of Zander. After becoming aware of the trouble at Gwen\u2019s door, he steps up to assist her by offering her and her family protection until she is able to testify. Gwen is one tough heroine, able to protect herself in her own way and I loved that she could so easily get under Zander\u2019s skin and drive him crazy. Zander knows that Gwen is independent, but he also knows something she doesn\u2019t and he\u2019s not going anywhere. The way he carefully handles the situation endeared him to me along with his protective instincts and desires.This is a fast paced, action filled story with a couple of storylines running through it that kept me engaged the whole time. The secondary characters from previous books added to the overall feel of pack and family and that was exactly what Gwen needed and I needed that for Gwen.

I had already pre-ordered this one on amazon so it was an added bonus getting to read it early.Zander was a character that the reader doesn't know much about- up until now, so I really liked that we get his full story and also that his mate ends up being a human. Gwen's mental toughness as well as her ability to hold her own in a fight situation with other humans definitely showed her strength as well. This made for a little different story from others in the series and was really enjoyable reading.

I just love the maturity of her characters. I can be pretty picky out heroines. I like my male characters to be pretty dominant but I need the female character to be strong as well. I just prefer reading a female character that stands up for herself and doesn't create more unnecessary drama due to lack of communication. Gwen is hands down one of my favorites. She stands up for herself in every way. She is being bullied and instead of backing down, she stands for what she believes is the right thing no matter the cost to herself. Even handling her very dominant wolf shifter, Zander she allows him to be what he needs, while still being what she needs to be for herself. That seems to be such a rare quality in a female lead lately.Zander was equally as great as Gwen. The dominance you see in his character isn't there to just be in charge. He genuinely needs to protect and care for Gwen and his pack mates. When she does something he doesn't like, these two handled it maturely. I get such a kick out of reading a couple like this. I genuinely can't wait for more in this series. There is just so many good side characters to look forward too. ARC provided by NetGalley."}, {"userName": "M.

I expected a lot more from this story, considering it's the first one with a human as one of the two main characters, but it did not deliver. I still enjoyed it though. Suzanne Wright writes sexy scenes and alpha males like NO OTHER, and on that front, this book did not disappoint. But action and pace wise, it was a bit slow for me. The other two books in this series (Spiral of Need and Force of Temptation) had a lot more action in my opinion. Not much was happening in this one, and certain parts really dragged. With that being said, I'm thinking the next book in this series might be Bracken's so I'm definitely looking forward to that! All in all, still enjoyed it, but my least favorite of the series.

It\u2019s an interesting twist already, and when you add in shifter/human drama, family drama, sizzling hotness, a heartfelt romance and a nice amount of action, this is another great read from Suzanne Wright. Like all of the heroines in this and the Phoenix Pack series, Gwen is strong, smart-mouthed and feisty. But she finds herself in a world of trouble when she protects a lone shifter from an attack by humans and jumps in to defend her, pushing both human and shifter law enforcement to investigate the issue and hand down punishment. It just so happens that the boys who attacked the shifter are from a very wealthy, influential family, and Gwen has been made a target for violence and persecution unless she drops her case. Zander meets Gwen when he stays at the Inn run by her family. He is attracted to the gorgeous human but he doesn\u2019t do relationships, and his wolf reacts strangely around her, retreating whenever she is near. But when he learns of the trouble she is in, he decides to stick around and offer his protection\u2026 allowing them more time to explore the sizzling chemistry between them. I really liked the progression of things between Zander and Gwen. Of course they are wildly attracted to each other, which is always lots of fun, but the shifter/human dynamic brings a new set of issues for them to contend with, and I thought that was really well done. I loved that Gwen was strong enough to stand up to Zander, holding nothing back and being open with everything she feels, and of course Zander is the demanding, controlling wolf that I love about this series, which creates lots of fireworks\u2026 and sizzlingy steamy sexy time. \n\u201cI'm greedy - I want all of you. I want you with me every day and every night.\u201d\n There\u2019s a nice emotional element to their relationship as well. Zander and Gwen have both been through a lot in their lives which leads to them holding back. Zander\u2019s wolf is wary and doesn\u2019t respond well when he gets close to women. And Gwen is all too aware that, as a shifter, Zander has a mate out there waiting for him and she has no intention of standing in the way of that. But despite the barriers, the emotion between them easily and naturally begins to deepen, forcing them to figure out what is important to them and just how far they are willing to go together. \nTo have someone made specifically for you\u2014someone who would never betray you, never hurt you, and would always cherish you\u2014would be something special. \n Alongside the romance, there\u2019s a great bunch of side characters \u2013 old and new \u2013 which add to the story, the side-storylines are really well fleshed out and blend in well with the overarching story, and the action is intense and exciting. And of course there\u2019s a whole lot of snark and banter which is highly entertaining and had me chuckling while I read.\n\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me while I\u2019m ignoring you\u2014that\u2019s just rude.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good at ignoring people, aren\u2019t you, Gwen?\u201d\u201cDude, I\u2019m so good at it, I can make people doubt that they\u2019re actually alive.\u201d\nI really enjoyed this book. I listened to it as an audiobook, and as always Jill Redfield does a great job. I liked Zander and Gwen as a couple, I could feel their connection and wanted their happy ending, and I really liked the way their story played out. And I thought the way that all of the side stories combined was really well done, creating a great read with action, excitement, laughs and a gorgeous romance.\n\u201cBaby...I couldn't give you up even if I wanted to.\u201d\n 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Lover of Romance", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3709091-lover-of-romance", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Addicted To Romance\u00a0Lure of Oblivion is the third exciting installment, of the Mercury Pack series. There is a lot of fun to be had\u00a0 in this story and really this whole series. The story sets off with a exciting thrill to it. Gwen Miller, is human, but when she stumbles across a lone shifter girl being beaten by a pole, she intervened and reported it to the authorities. Now she is being contantly tormented by those boys who once assaulted her new found friend who she protects. But until the hearing from the shifter council, she must stay strong and fight them off no matter how bad it gets. Zander has arrived at Gwen's inn at just the right time, when the violence has escalated and has gained a certain respect for a human defending his own kind when humans rarely do especially at such a great risk to themselves. Zander and his wolf have always been wary of women. However his wolf is somewhat different around Gwen. Wary, but not trying to push women away like normal and Zander doesn't know why Gwen is so different. But he soon realizes that she is his true mate and he must prove to her of his devotion and passion for her all the while making sure Gwen is protected by their enemies.This was such a wonderful story that I easily breezed my way through. Like always with this author, I fell in love with the story and the characters and the action and the romance of course!! It was pretty great to get to know Zander more though. He has always been more reserved and apart from the others. He tends to brood quite a bit. Of course he has some tough history. A twin who is pretty mentally insane and violent and has always been that way. Then we have the three boys who have fathers who always spoil them and protect them and never let them suffer any consequences and boy they are pretty bad villains in the story. I did like seeing the way the story unfolded in a way thouhg. Its slightly predictable, but a book you can easily relax into and just enjoy the ride. I think what I enjoyed most was seeing Gwen and Zander learn to trust and seeing the slow built romance form between them. Even though we have the whole\"fated mate\" aspect going on, we see quite a bit of emotional development that makes you swoon and sigh. If I had to pick who my favorite character it would be Gwen. She is so fearless, and always going to be doing the right thing no matter how dangerous the situation. I respected her so much in this book because we so how much she puts herself at risk for someone else and seeing that they get the justice they deserve."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly", "userReview": "This is the fifth book I've read from this author and while nothing has topped the first one for me, Feral Sins, this was decent. It was nice seeing some of the characters from the previous books make an appearance in this one. I will say that the one reference to Yahoo made me laugh at the author (who doesn't use Google?!) and the shtick of Gwen starting a sentence, stopping halfway, and then saying nevermind and refusing to finish made me twitchy. Ending the book with her doing it yet again was...an interesting choice. For the record if anyone in my real life had this habit, we would have to stop being friends because otherwise I'd be forced to murder you and murder is bad.

This book has a human heroine, maybe she won't be- oh ok cool she's slutty too. I'm not slut shaming. I'm just tired of all the characters being exactly the same!Hero is just like every other hero, grouchy, quiet, surprising everyone when he opens up to the heroine. Even the one male that was always smiling suddenlu became quiet and angry when his book was written. Come on. WRITE SOMETHING NEW!Plot? Exactly the same as the other books. Heroine is in a rough spot. Hero vows to protect her until a hoard of shifter for hire mercinaries distract him and the other pack mates allowing the villian of the story to pounce on the now unprotected heroine.
