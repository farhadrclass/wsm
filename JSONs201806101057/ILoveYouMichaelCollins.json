They play with her cat, Campbell, watch television when they can, read in the cool basement, or more often, run around outside until dinner time. Mamie is enthralled with the upcoming NASA project, and has decided that she likes astronaut Michael Collins more than Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin, and continues her class project of writing a letter to an astronaut even though it's summer vacation. She finds it a good way of dealing with the stresses in her life. Her father thinks the NASA mission is a waste of money, but her mother wants to have a Launch Party. When her father says that she can't, it's the last straw, and her mother packs a bag and goes to stay with his sister. After a couple of days of awkwardly tending to Mamie, her father also goes off to try to reconcile with her mother. Mamie is left in the care of her older sister Bess, who is either sleeping or hanging out with her boyfriend Vinny, and even older sister Eleanor, who has her own apartment and works as a secretary. Mamie isn't too worried about being on her own, and doesn't want Buster to tell his mother. Instead, the two research Apollo 11, and Mamie plans her own party. As exciting as the moon walk is, it also is an event that shows how much life is changing in Mamie's world, and all around her. Strengths: The details of everyday life in 1969 are absolutely perfect. THIS is what we need in historical novels. The constant battle over Froot Loops (How are they better than Cap'n Crunch?), the insistence that children need to be outside all day, the phone numbers written on the side of the phone, the details of watching the NASA coverage (Buster's father works downtown, so will go to the appliance store to watch!), and the idea that a 16 year old who sleeps all day is perfectly fine for watching a ten year old while her parents are two states away-- wow. Tang. Erector sets. Hoop earrings. One fan in the house that moves from room to room. This book used more details to good effect than any I have read recently. On top of that, the story was pitch perfect as well. Mamie's mother is tired of being at home, tired of having to ask permission, and her father was just confused about this. It had always been that way! Why isn't it working now? Told through Mamie's eyes, and including lots of details about the moon launch and talk, this is a fantastic slice of red and blue frosted life at a particular moment in time. Weaknesses: I'm not a fan of epistolographic novels involving famous people (Dear Hank Williams, and it just seems like there are others), but this had such great details about daily life that it won me over. Also, the pitcher for the Tang on the front cover is not quite right. There were about 400 million promotional Tang pitchers, and I'm betting Buster would have had one!What I really think: ADORED this. Buying two copies because it is so perfect for the 1960s unit one of my teachers does."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226292-ellen", "userReview": "I was about the same age as Mamie when the first astronauts walked on the moon, so reading this book was a stroll down memory lane for me. Like Mamie's, my parents told us we had to play outside all day, every day, in the summer and I don't remember ever being bored. Mamie and her best friend and next-door neighbor Buster played together every day and spent a lot of time at the library learning everything they could about that summer's mission to the moon. Told in a series of letters to Michael Collins, the third astronaut on the mission who stayed on the ship while the other two walked on the moon, Mamie pours out her heart and she broke mine a little with her candor and bravery in what was a difficult summer for her. A love letter to friendship and to those who stay behind with the ship, this was the balm I needed for the rough summer I've been having.

As historical fiction for children goes, it was so refreshing to read a story that was tied to the specific time, with period details, and a historical event, that was not Colonial America. And I really liked how it was a part of the story. Regarding one aspect of the story: I think today's readers' minds will boggle at kids being left alone, and honestly even as a very lax parent I thought \"wait, what? why is no one making sure someone is there?\"I thought her feelings were so real and I always enjoy a story told through letters.

And want a friend like Buster. And (regrettably) be reminded that Tang existed.The facts that: the book is fiction, set in 1969, Mamie doesn't exist and I haven't seen Tang since the 80s are all minor points. The feelings remain, as does the beauty of the story.'I Love You, Michael Collins' is one of those rare gems of a novel that not only discusses the fears, hopes and relationships of 10 year-olds (and associated humans), but does so with humour, outstanding voice, and respect for the range and scope of their experiences and feelings.The pivotal importance of your best friend (and particular enthusiastic applause for a girl-boy best friend pairing!), dependability, communication and loyalty are neither sugar-coated nor avoided. Baratz-Logsted doesn't take the easy plot twists either, or escapes, and the novel is all the more exceptional for it.In terms of wordcraft, Baratz-Logsted approaches the fears of Mamie brilliantly, with a deft use of epistolary (for the entire novel), interwoven with historical phrasing and nuance which only highlights the depth of the characters and fundamental relationships in Mamie's orbit. The characterisation of Mamie is skillfully crafted; her differences are revealed in passing, (sometimes with hilarious, sometimes stinging, asides), her motives believable, her pain all the more devastating as a result. I admit it. This book made me cry. It also made me laugh, had me run my fingers over the cover and angle it to better catch the light, remember my own best friend at age 10, and put this to the top of my list for gift-giving this year. I don't care how old you are, this book is humanity, beauty and sheer wonder."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1363258-kris", "userReview": "I loved it.

Ah, letter writing, the social media of Mamie's day and one that didn't involve sharing the pouring out of your guts with the world. Unless, of course you are a character in a book. Yet I don't think it was Mamie sharing her day to day life--including family dysfunction--in this way was what threw me out of the story several times. We all need a way to vent on occasion and pouring out our confused emotions to a stranger, one we will never meet, can seem much \"safer\" than doing so with someone we know. Rather, it was the \"As you know, Bob--or in this case, Michael Collins\" style of storytelling the letter device made unavoidable when it came to providing the necessary background information. I'm hoping readers who didn't live through those historic events won't find it so distracting because the overall story is good. And besides, I have a soft spot myself for Michael Collins."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "This one is a 3.5 for me. For those who think that teachers and their assignments have little impact outside of the classroom on their students, this book provides ready evidence to the contrary. After her teacher assigns the class to write to their favorite astronaut, ten-year-old Mamie decides to write to Michael Collins while the boys write to Buzz Aldrin and the girls write to Neil Armstrong. For reasons that will become evident over the course of the book, Mamie feels a strong connection to Collins who will remain with the space ship while the other two men will walk on the moon. Although she receives no reply to her initial letter and even after school ends for the year, she continues to write to the astronaut, pouring out her heart and revealing the troubles that plague her family as her parents fight and separate. It's a good thing that Mamie has a bet friend, her next door neighbor, Buster, with whom she spends her free time. Buster is an avid reader and someone who is curious about everything, even space and rockets. Because Mamie's story is told through her letters to Michael Collins during the summer of 1969 as the world prepares for this groundbreaking event, readers are able to hear her voice clearly and read between the lines about some of her feelings. While there are points in which that written voice seems too mature and sophisticated and too grammatically correct for a ten-year-old, the author excels at painting a vivid portrait of 1969 with Tang as a drink served as a tribute to the astronauts as well as certain foods, clothing, music, news coverage, effectively capturing a time when the whole world held its breath as the first men walked on the moon. And yes, I still remember the distorted voice of Armstrong as he moved across that landscape after my father insisted on my brother and me getting out of bed to behold history in the making. This title is charming in many respects, providing a glimpse into the way things were way back in 1969. The judgmental attitudes of many toward those who dressed differently from them or held beliefs different from them when it came to politics or the role of women in the home are captured vividly here, leaving readers to form their own impressions from the hints that are dropped. As I always tell my students, those were turbulent times. As her family seemed to be falling apart and everyone was deserting her, I'm grateful that at least Mamie had Buster. There is a lot of truth to the fact that it's those heroes who simply quietly go about doing their jobs and staying with the ship or holding down the fort on the home front who go unrecognized but deserve their own measure of recognition and appreciation."}, {"userName": "Carolyn Deas", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7228231-carolyn-deas", "userReview": "I Love You, Michael Collins is not a true story, but I'm sure it hits home with a lot of people when it comes to the \"celebrities\" that they look up to.In this story, Mamie, is directed to write a letter to one of the three Apollo 11 astronauts. With most students picking Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin, Mamie takes a different route and writes to the main pilot, Michael Collins. Mr. Collins is almost never mentioned by anyone (most people don't know who he even is) but Mamie takes it upon herself to let him know just how great he is.A one time assignment to write a letter becomes a passion for Mamie. She writes him a letter almost everyday until the day he lands safely back on earth. She writes about her family problems, her best friend, Buster, her cat, Campbell, and asks him all sorts of questions about his life and family.What I love most about this book is that she is rooting for the underdog. I'm sure there is a better way to say that, but I can't think of one currently. Mamie learns everything she can about this man and comes to find out that it was a struggle for him to get to where he is. She also realizes that he may be the most important one on the Apollo 11 mission; without him, no one will get home.The emotions that Mamie goes through during the story are vivid in her messages to Mr. Collins. Haven't you ever just wanted to tell someone everything that's on your mind? Although she had never met this man and he didn't get most of her letters before his trip to space, she feels confident that he's reading them and that he cares. Back when a time when there was no social media to connect with people that we admire, letter writing was the only way to go and there are no \"read receipts\" for snail mail.I thought that some of the issues that Mamie had to deal with, like both of her parents more or less abandoning her and her sisters being unaware of how to take care of a ten year old were a little too much for this story. I understand she needed something to write to Mr. Collins about but it just seemed weird and out of place and something that wouldn't actually happen, even in 1969 (but I could be wrong).If you love space, diaries, the moon, and kids becoming friends with adults, then this is a book for you. It will make you smile, laugh, and even cry a little but it's a story with heart."}, {"userName": "Terri Faulkner", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52009804-terri-faulkner", "userReview": "I Love You, Michael Collins is a tender novel set in a richly detailed 1969 small town America, a time in which TV dinners were enticing fare, debates about who was the better Beatle raged, and the nation was captivated by the Space Race and the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. Mamie is the 10-year-old protagonist, the youngest of three sisters (including Eleanor and Bess, all of whom were named after the First Lady at the time of their birth). Her best friend is the boy next door, Buster, and their steadfast friendship guides the story through the events surrounding the launch of Apollo 11 in July, 1969. Mamie continues a school-year class assignment in which she was supposed to write a letter to one of the Apollo 11 astronauts. While her classmates chose to write to the better-known Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin, Mamie chose to write to Michael Collins, the third Apollo 11 crew member, the one so frequently overlooked and the one who must stay with the ship instead of walking on the moon. The book is written in letter style, with Mamie describing her family, her world and the discord between her parents in long letters she send to Michael Collins. She is also fearful for Michael Collins, aware of the very real dangers he chooses to face as an astronaut and the courage he must be summoning to continue forward. Her voice is clear and convincing as a sometimes silly-sometimes wisely observant child, and the parallels between her choices and those of Michael Collins will not be lost on young readers. This is a solid choice, a delightful first-person account of friendship, anxiety and national pride."}, {"userName": "The Dusty Jacket", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56572994-the-dusty-jacket", "userReview": "It\u2019s 1969 and the day before the last day before summer vacation.

I particularly enjoyed the framing device, as a one-sided epistolary novel, with all the letters written to the oft-forgotten third man on the Apollo 11 mission, Michael Collins, who stayed with the ship. It dragged a little at times and students who already know a lot about the Apollo missions will find some of the explanations tedious. Recommended: I'd give it to kids who like character-driven historical fiction. The main character reads pretty young so I'd say about 3rd-6th graders will find the most to enjoy.

I enjoyed the voice of the POV character and found her to be lovable, however, at times I felt this was not a 10 year old speaking, but an older tween. Some of the ideas and thoughts she had seemed too old for a fourth-grader. Overall, I am happy I got to know Mamie and Buster and still have a smile on my face because the ending is so perfect. Michael Collins and Mamie turn out to have more in common than just the love of the space race.Spoiler alert: Even though this was set in 1969, leaving a child home alone who is only 10 for more than just a quick errand or awaiting your return from work after school, is unrealistic and scary to me as a parent. I would never just leave without talking to the responsible person who is promising to be there for my child; based on the loving relationships this author must feel are important for families in her own life (Mamie's own parents are loving and caring people in this book), the leaving seemed too much out of character.

This book really did a great job of capturing the excitement of what it must have been like to follow Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins as they set out to be the first men to make it to the moon. And while not delving too deeply into those topics, it does give a solid nod to other social issues of the time. I enjoyed it and learned a lot along the way."}, {"userName": "Mary Louise Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2315127-mary-louise-sanchez", "userReview": "A school assignment to write to one of the three astronauts going to the moon in 1969 becomes more to ten-year-old Mamie (named for a First Lady) as she continues to tell him the details of her life.

This epistolary novel is told through her letters to the astronaut on that expedition who didn't walk on the moon because his job was to stay with the spaceship. Mamie continues to write to Collins after school ends, telling him about Buster, her neighbor and best friend, about her two older sisters, and about her parents, whose separation may be leading to a divorce. This is a nice mixture of recent U.S. history and family issues from a child's perspective."}, {"userName": "Megan Marvel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4095840-megan-marvel", "userReview": "This book would make SUCH a great pick for a book club. There is so much to unpack within the novel. Discussions could revolve around historical fiction, the space race, popularity, family (separation/siblings), friendship, responsibility, and much more. Poor Mamie's family desert her and leave her home by herself, each thinking someone else will take responsibility and look after her. This occurs during the momentous time of the moon landing. Mamie's story is paralleled with her newfound hero, Michael Collins, who, like Mamie, is the one left behind."}, {"userName": "Isabel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3224477-isabel", "userReview": "In BHHs, you are often asked, \u201cWhat does the author think you know?\u201d In I Love You, Michael Collins, Baratz-Logsted drops the reader into the 1960s during the era of the US\u2019s space race against Russia to be the first to get to the moon. The author alludes to the politics of the era as well as the challenges of being female in the 1960s. This book is a great example of choosing a setting that matches the struggle of the character herself. It\u2019s also written in epistolary (letter) style which means the story is told to us even though the character is writing to an astronaut. This is a surprisingly complex text considering that it is also appropriate for a younger audience.You can go as deep or shallow as you like with this story.Dive in!"}], "description": "It\u2019s 1969 and the country is gearing up for what looks to be the most exciting moment in U.S. history: men landing on the moon.

Only Mamie writes to Michael Collins, the astronaut who will come so close but never achieve everyone else's dream of walking on the moon, because he is the one who must stay with the ship. After school ends, Mamie keeps writing to Michael Collins, taking comfort in telling someone about what's going on with her family as, one by one, they leave the house thinking that someone else is taking care of her\u2014until she is all alone except for her cat and her best friend, Buster.
