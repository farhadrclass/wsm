Many times there have been books that I give one or two stars to and it seems wrong somehow. Because I don't mean \"this book is terrible\" or \"stay away from this\", I mean \"I didn't like it\" or \"it wasn't my thing\". And that's a bit like how I feel about White Space. I feel my rating doesn't say what needs to be said. I also think this book is going to be a real mind-blowing favourite in the hands of the right reader, but I know that myself (and quite a lot of other people I know on goodreads) won't be that right reader. This is my first read by Bick so I can't compare it to the author's other work, but I will say that it's a complex, densely-written mindfuck.I'm going to try to give you some idea of where I stand when it comes to complex sci-fi so you can see if we're likely to think the same. White Space is compared to The Matrix - a movie which I like a lot - but if you found the concept in The Matrix even vaguely complex, you might feel the neurons in your brain starting to explode while reading White Space. Plus, if you ask me, The Matrix is mentioned far too many times in this book; it felt like the author was trying to convince us of the similarities and it didn't work for me. Though I think what makes White Space even harder to struggle through (and struggle through I did), is not simply the complexity of the story, but the fact that the majority of these 560 pages keeps you completely in the dark. There's only so much not knowing that I can take before I lose interest and no longer care. When you don't know what's going on for many pages of a book, I suppose it can go two ways: either your need-to-know is strong enough to keep you reading (as it was for me in Charm & Strange) or your lack of understanding leads to a lack of caring. As it was here.The truth is, the idea behind this story is fantastic. It's mainly about a seventeen year old girl called Emma who experiences \"blinks\". During these blinks, she zones out and finds herself viewing the life of someone else. One of these other lives is the life of Lizzie McDermott who is the daughter of a famous author - Frank McDermott. Frank has been meddling where he shouldn't, using the Dark Passages to travel to what are essentially alternate universes and dragging things from the Dark Passages onto White Space. I'd like to say this makes a lot more sense when you read the book, but that might be something of a lie. Anyway, Frank has become addicted to the Dark Passages and this is, to put it lightly, a very bad thing.Sounds really unique and imaginative, right? Oh, it is. But the cool idea and the interesting payoff in the end didn't make up for nearly 600 pages of dense writing and boredom. The way it was written made the book feel twice the length it was, even forcing me to re-read passages in order to understand what was going on. The constant changing of POVs also meant I struggled to feel a single connection to any character. I felt like I was trying to watch and understand something moving at 200mph but I couldn't make sense of it. New POVs came whizzing in from nowhere and transported me to another equally confusing part of the story. This may be the first time I've used the words \"couldn't put it down\" as a negative because I literally couldn't put it down if I wanted to carry on understanding what was happening. Every time real life demanded my attention, I'd return and have to skim read the previous chapter to work out where the hell I was in the story (and this is coming from someone who regularly reads 3 or 4 books at once with ease).There's some fantastic philosophical questioning going on here when you get into the story and I really do LOVE the idea of it. Bick makes us question the nature of reality and that would normally have me freaking out with happiness. But it's too dense, too all over the place, too many POV changes... the result, for me, was less brilliance and more of a mess. I think readers' opinions will be seriously divided on this one. I read a positive review that said: \"This book exists solely for the payoff at the end\" which couldn't be more accurate. Maybe that statement will help you decide whether this one is for you or not."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "how on earth i managed to forget halfway through that this was only the first part of something is beyond me. but i did.and i wouldn't call that ending a cliffhanger so much as a non-ending. and i don't mean that as criticism, although it sounds like one. were this not part of a series, yes, those would be fighting words, but since there is more to come, i will just say i was\u2026surprised that it ended where it did, and it felt like almost 600 pages of buildup that left me a little stranded.this has been billed as the matrix meets inkheart. i have not seen the matrix. i have not read inkheart. i know what both of them are about, more or less, but i can't tell you how much this book is informed by them. she refers to so many specific scenes from the matrix that i think it would have been helpful for me to have had that in my back pocket o'references. however, she does allude to several other movies i have seen: shutter island, inception, identity (WHY, john cusack, WHYYY?), so just by looking at those movies all grouped together, you have a pretty good sense of what this book is about and the way it is going to play with reality/illusion/artifice.my caution to you: the first chapter/thirty pages is kind of a trial to get through. she thrusts you into an off-kilter situation with lots of white space-specific vocabulary: dark passages, nows, panops, peculiars, thought-magic glass, sign of sure, dickens mirror, monster-doll, hanger-on, and i was very \"it is that kind of book?? i don't yike it!!\" and it's a situation you will not understand until you get further in. the tone of it was very dark-fantasy without footholds and i was fearful that i was going to have to struggle through 500 pages of this kooky world that i just wasn't feeling off the bat. but then it broadens (oh, how it broadens) and you get to enter the story through several characters who are discovering the flexible parameters of the world along with you, the reader, and it is much smoother sailing after that. if you have a more solid background in sci-fi/fantasy than i do, you probably won't even be fazed. but i was fazed. i love dark fantasy when it is set in our world, slightly tilted. my difficulty is in absorbing new fantasy-vocabulary and concepts and i have difficulty with make-believe worlds when the author has not prepared the reader enough with world-building foundations. i have to stick my fingers in the wounds to understand. fortunately, after those rocky first 30 pages, this turned into exactly my kind of dark fantasy. i'm not gonna lie - there were parts that confused the hell out of me, this is mind-bending, physics-defying stuff. but it's completely captivating, and i loved the way she built the feeling of dread throughout and dropped enough breadcrumbs for the reader to experience several \"aha!\" moments and to begin to see the cracks. the journey is worth the sort of dropped ending. i love how into science the girls in bick's books always are. and even though their at-the-ready explanations under pressure are a little alarming and make me think i should have paid more attention in high school physics, it's great to have smart girls leading the pack through these stories. ooh-rah girl power, etc. i also love how much neurological and psychological material finds its way into her books. it puts them a nice challenging step above most YA offerings, particularly in the horror genre.it's a dense book with multiple POVs and if i started talking about the actual plot, you would be as confused as i was reading those first thirty pages. the fun of this book is the journey and the discoveries, so even if i could find a way to explain the situation in a way that would make sense and not go off into hundreds of tangents, i probably wouldn't. it is dense and confusing but there are too many exciting brain-buzzy reader-chill payoff moments to dismiss it on those grounds. i will definitely read the second part, even though i know from reading bick before that she is not going to give a damn about reminding you what happened in the first book, so take notes. you will need them."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8471229-mary", "userReview": "[I'm still unclear on the Dickens Mirror.

I despise any DNF but this book is so damn long I cannot drag myself through any longer.I have a few reasons for flouncing and since I did manage to get 45% in, I'll mention them. First off, the fact that the reader is dumped straight away in a world with way way wayyyyyyy too many made up words/objects.\nImagine for a moment if I said to you:\n\"I'm going to put my badonkadonk into my confuggle and then take the scnogoggle to the farfugizap.\"\nTranslation is:A) Andrea is channeling Dr. Seuss.B) Andrea has lost her damn mind.C) Both A and Bor D)Welcome to the world of White Space.The correct answer is D. If you said B you are also partially correct.Second flouncing reason is way too many POVs. You need a small notepad next to you while reading to keep track of all the individuals. Many of whom die or simply aren't all that important to have their own chapters. I can do multiple POVs, when they are done in a sensible way. Add to this the chapter flow.

I certainly don't need it in the books I read.Made me batshit crazy.Final reason for flouncing. The fucking Matrix referencing every five fucking minutes. I get it. This is comparable to the damn movie. Neo is fucking awesomesauce. Whoohoooo. Morpheus rocks. The (one of million) MC wishes she had the red pill not the blue one like what Neo got. Blah blah blah.\nWell, I have a newsflash. Not everyone lurves The Matrix. Me included. Have I seen it? Yes. Was it my all time favorite movie of all fucking time? Um, nope. There are people in the reading world who don't give a rat's ass about the damn movie or Neo. So, don't reference it a thousand times. This is a book.

Proper review to come later**3.5 starsThank you Egmont USA for sending me this copy. No compensation was given or taken to alter this review.I feel like I should point out that this book will have many many mixed ratings. I for one, have already seen a bucketload of DNFs and another handful of people who gave this 4-5 stars. White Space, is one of those books that start off really crappy and end so amazing you just need to sit down and stare into oblivion for a while. \n What didn't work for me: \nTHE CHANGING OF POVS: We start off with Lizzie, a girl who has some really odd parents. Her family moved into the middle of nowhere after the incident in London. Basically,\u00a0Lizzie's father\u00a0can reach into a mirror and pull out characters and put them into his novels. After these really odd few chapters in Lizzie's POV, we change into Emma's. Emma has been having 'blinks' where her world fades out and she can see through the eye's of someone else, a someone like Lizzie. After a back and forth change between these two character's POV, it was pretty good. The entire book was written in third person which made the changing manageable. That's until we start gettting random POVs of characters, they're so random, we even had new POVs coming in at 50% in of the book. Not only were there more\u00a0POVs\u00a0than the number of fingers on my hand, but also they were short. Once I was actually getting into the story, the POV would switch and I would get completely agitated and detatched from the novel once more.\nTHE PACING: Another factor that contributed into why I was not a fan of this book was the pace of this novel. I see that people are going to DNF this novel, not only because of the changing and number of points of views however also because the pace is painful. It is not to say that I was bored out of my brains but I needed answers. I was so damn confused for majority of the novel it made me want to rip all the hairs out of my head. However, some people are going to love the feel of a heavy blanked draped over their heads. To be honest, I enjoyed the feeling too but after some time, I started to wonder what the point of this book was. Nevertheless, the end redeemed this book. In a way.\n\n What did work for me: \nBASICALLY\u00a0EVERYTHING ELSE: The world Ilsa J. Bick creates is truly crazy madness. It's a lot to stomach however as the story goes on and changes--you get used to it. I love the concept and the way it was executed was close to perfection. Maybe a few more answers to entertain the readers, though. White Space is obviously a plot orientated book despite the quantity of points of views. Surprisingly, White Space is a thought-provoking read. You start to ponder the given facts of life more and more, the further we go into the book. Such as; what is reality? Are we actually just characters from a book?This one is going to be loved and hated."}, {"userName": "Tandie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11494588-tandie", "userReview": "White Space was terribly disappointing for me. It certainly didn't read like young adult fiction. The characters were the right age, but it was more like a super-complicated science fiction novel. I consider myself a fairly intelligent reader and I could barely follow the story. I found myself rereading pages, flipping back to reread whole chapters. There were so many different points of view, it made my head spin. New POVs were being introduced even in the last half of the book. The kicker? This book is almost 600 pages long! This book is touted as being in the tradition of Memento and Inception. I had a huge problem swallowing all the main character's references to The Matrix. \"Who do I think I am? Neo?\" \"Just like Keanu Reeves.\" There were at least 5 unnecessary allusions to The Matrix. I like that movie by the way. Apparently, so does the author. There were also mentions of Inkheart and Inception. Can you guess that this book is about alternate realities? What is real?The first chapter hits the ground running into a world where panops, diddlyhumps, swoozels, arguses, & typhons exist. Words pop into being & you can't even guess at their meaning from the context of the sentence. There is no world building, no explaining. This chapter is from a precocious (smarter than her smart parents) five year old's point of view. Um, nope. The next chapter drops us into high school junior Emma's head. She blinks into other realities. The story jumps all over the place and even when some of the characters meet, we still have no clue what's going on. It felt a lot like channel surfing the TV for hours. I know that the ending was supposed to blow my mind. I think maybe a hard core sci-fi lover might have thought it was clever. Maybe not. Part of the reason The Matrix and Inception were so cool was the amazing cinematography. After all those movie mentions, I think a more reasonable ending would've been that Emma is really a teenager who's watched The Matrix, Memento, & Inception so many times (and maybe partaken of mind altering drugs) that she thinks she's living out all those movies at once."}, {"userName": "Amber  ~ The Reading Addict", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3172251-amber-the-reading-addict", "userReview": "The Matrix meets Inkheart?

If you want to read this with proper formatting go to Ransom Reads Major Selling Points: BookceptionThe whole conept of stories being parallel universes/people that may or may not really exist and the fact that authors pulled the characters and words from those different words onto white space was what really drew me to\u00a0White Space. I wanted to find out how it worked, and the added mystery of \"is what I'm reading real or are these characters in this book actually from another book\" and you know what I mean. I hope.Horror (that actually creeped me out)The summary I read was really short and did not hint to any horror. So I was pleasantly surprised when characters started dying and creepy creatures/things appeared. And I became too scared to read this at night. Swashbuckling: And this is where it starts going downhill... There are many interwoven story lines in\u00a0White Space. All heading toward a main point, and all decent I suppose, but it does get very confusing. Mainly because there's so much going on and it felt like I understood... well not much. This confusion and a lack of connection to the characters, combined with the length, had me dragging my feet through it. Lingo: The writing in this was actually decent, and I feel the voice is unique. It took a bit of adjusting on my part, but after a while I did start to enjoy it. Even highlighted some passages that stood out to me. One of the complaints I've seen about it is the chapters ending \"mid sentence\" (when in reality the final words were the beginning of the next chapter. It was... interesting) Crew: All of the characters (because it's too hard to talk about each individually)I'm not going to write about the characters individually because a) I'm lazy and b) my feelings on each are fairly similar: I sort of liked them, but didn't connect. It felt like a back story of any kind was lacking in detail, were were just given the relevant frame of their lives and only saw their actions which fit in the plot. Each was distinct however, and I never mixed them up in my head which is good. And quite a few died which may not be so good. Swoonability: Romance is another thing in\u00a0White Space\u00a0I didn't particularly enjoy. The main couple was just plain annoying (to me) and though they didn't get together for a long time, when they did it meant time for a make out session at a time they could possibly die. Don't you just love that? The other couple actually looked like it was developing really nicely but then the ending happens and I don't know if it even has a chance anymore.

When it starts it\u2019s narrated by a little girl: with a little kid\u2019s linguistic idiosyncrasies and\u2026 I really can\u2019t explain why, but it makes everything a hundred times creepier.So let\u2019s start: there is a little girl, Lizzie, a mother who dabbled in some really dark stuff, and a father who is dabbling in some really dark stuff.You see, when Lizzies father creates a story he doesn\u2019t just come up with it, he reaches into a mirror and through scratches and gouges pulls out characters from the White Space and into his Now. And sometimes these characters don\u2019t stay in the books. They come outside and hide in the house.When the story starts one such character was doing just that:\u201cA footprint. On the wall. That\u2019s when Mom feels someone watching, too.\u201dLizzie\u2019s mother creates her own characters out of blown glass, the Peculiars. Lizzie tried making one once but she set the temperature wrong and the glass melted into a monstrosity: the monster doll who is not very\u2026 nice.\u201cThe inside of the monster-doll\u2019s head is all gluey-ooky, the thoughts sticky as spiderwebs.\u201dThis is all incredibly spooky; it\u2019s like High Octane Coraline. There is also a cat, Marmalade, who indulges in a time-honoured cat tradition of being an asshole and doing this:\u201cMarmalade sometimes stares, not at birds or bright coins of sunlight but the space between, while his tail goes twitch-twitch. The cat sees something Lizzie doesn\u2019t.\u201dFrom that we jump to Emma\u2019s POV. Emma has a metal plate in her head and killer migraines which announce themselves with spidery cracks into reality and she gets to see Lizzie\u2019s Now. She had also lived with a father-figure painter who pulled creatures from the White Space into his canvas.The plot jumps from Lizzie to Emma and back again, then starts including a bunch of other POVs. Personally, I loved Lizzie\u2019s side of the story, and felt that Emma\u2019s side and all the other characters\u2019, though compelling, dragged a bit. Lizzie\u2019s story was so much creepier, perhaps because, as I said, she was a little kid and saw and described things in a peculiar way that just wormed itself in to the reader\u2019s brain.I\u2019m not the type of reader who appreciates switching POV every chapter, it keeps me from getting attached to the story. Every time you really start getting into it, SWITCH!, you\u2019re reading about someone else doing something else. All in all there were about 7 POVs, sometimes it cuts from one to another in the middle of a sentence. That\u2019s cool for a movie script but for an actual book it\u2019s just incredibly exasperating. I, personally, started to lose interest in several characters. I wished the book was only about Lizzie and her family (which would have been way more than enough!), and had to force myself not to skip ahead when the focus wasn\u2019t on them.But the plot is pretty good! And it brought up a bunch of questions regarding parallel universes, the nature of reality, and space, and time, and who we really are. And when most of the POV characters meet up on the mountain and realise the fog is hiding something\u2026 It\u2019s worth reading!I must admit, I was very frustrated throughout the book, as I said, the multiple POVs really do not work for me, but I was never, ever bored! And while being entertained was enough for me, it won\u2019t be for everyone, you have to go for a really, really long time through lots of confusing questions and questions and questions to get some answers literally when you\u2019ve gone through 88% of the book.If anything this book may be too ambitious, it tried to do too much, too many characters, too many stories \u2013 to be fair, all of them intertwined, but there was too much going on.But like I said: it was never boring.

It opens with Lizzie, a precocious child, observing a conflict between her parents play out. This bit is filled with odd vocabulary and a strange magic, and just as soon as you think you've figured out the rules, a girl named Emma wakes up from her reverie about being Lizzie to recall how she came to be driving through the mountains. And so on, flashing though narrators and their stories and the way they come together.WHITE SPACE is a disorienting experience. It keeps almost coming together into something nice and neat when Ilsa J. Bick throws another curveball in the story's rules. This wouldn't work for most books, but WHITE SPACE is a horror novel. The shifts in the text keep the readers as off balance as the characters. Plus, it is metafictional horror. The characters are, in many ways, threatened by potential monsters fueled by their own fears. The deceptive looseness of the structure makes the amorphous more frightening.I was thrilled by WHITE SPACE. This is a disturbing book, full of imagery that gets beneath your skin, like a shirt wearing a person or crawling through tunnels (filled with things I'll leave to you to discover). It's a book that trusts the reader's intelligence, to remember the details and fit them together, to be able to readjust whenever there is a paradigm shift. It's also populated with strangely likeable characters for a horror novel.I will say that WHITE SPACE goes on a touch too long. It's the beginning of a series, and stands fairly well on its own, although the ending chapters clearly lead-in to the next book. But there is a bit of fatigue before then, because this is one fat novel. I loved the rising tension of the opening, things ever so slightly not right.

I can see how this could have confused, frustrated and annoyed people, but I managed to follow the book until the halfway mark, when it all goes downhill from there.Filled with physics based explanations, story book realities and discussions of the Dark Passages, Dickson\u2019s Mirror and the Fog, at this point of the book I just wanted some answers. Rarely are we given straight explanations about what is happening, with us having to rely on what we are told is real through the different characters\u2019 experiences, and what we think is real. The book blurb gives more clarity for what is happening than the book itself ever does. I was frustrated at the ending, which seemed to be completely deviant from the bulk of the plot itself and felt like a cop out.Emma was the book\u2019s shining character, she\u2019s been in and out of psychological wards as she blinks herself into existence. She\u2019s got Alice in Wonderland syndrome, where she perceives different images of herself and finds herself in completely different lives. Her only common denominator is Kramer, who always has a position of authority over her, and Jasper, her father. Emma is a link between the story book characters, and Lizzie, the daughter of the writer and creator of the stories, and the latter of half of the book converges their storylines together.There were some truly creative ways of describing the gore and horror, which Ilsa J Bick seems to excel at:Whenever she coughed, he kept expecting bloody hunks of gnawed lung or liver or intestine to come flying out of her mouth. When he gave another moist, ripping cough, the spray that spattered the snow reminded him of those red sprinkles they put on cupcakes.While certainly a creative direction to take a book, I think we would have benefited from a lot more answers and less vagueness when it came to the explanations. In order to be emotionally invested, we had to get to know the characters and who they truly were, which was a major barrier for my enjoyment here.White Space wasn\u2019t a bad read by any means, it was just a vague and confusing story that alludes to alternate realities and a blur between fact and fiction. It\u2019s definitely a creative, unique book that reminded me very much of Sucker Punch, except with a lot less action and scantily clad women.I received a review copy from Egmont USA in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Richard Denney", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4588953-richard-denney", "userReview": "This comes out on my birthday next year WOOT WOOT!! :pAnd look at the motherfucking cover! my brain is experiencing multiple orgasms right now.

That\u2019s why I loved this one so much. The worldbuilding is fantastic and so detailed so that all these different parts of the story are hard to follow. This is a story you have to get yourself completely into. It\u2019s not a story you can rush through and it\u2019s everything but a light read.This book is described as \u201cMatrix meets Inkheart\u201d for a reason. It is not only just as amazing, complex and confusing as Matrix or Inception and just as mad as Alice in Wonderland but it also has a lot of actual Matrix references.If you already read Ashes by Ilsa J. Bick you know that you\u2019re in for an action packed story and that you won\u2019t have a single moment to calm down. What seemed rather exaggerated in Ashes in my opinion worked out just fine in this case and makes for a great story.Every single page is chaos, action and encounters with life threatening things. There was not even a single page where the characters got some rest and you could calm your mind in-between this constant epicness.A book inside a book, characters who might not be real isn\u2019t even a new idea I\u2019ve never read about before. The package all this comes with is something unique and thrilling though. Just like the characters I had no idea what is going on, no idea about what is real and what isn\u2019t. This story is completely unpredictable. Even after finishing the book I\u2019m still somewhat clueless. This is a story I might reread a few times to be able to take in every single detail.White Space is a book you should read when you have a lot of time because once you start it, you won\u2019t be able to put it down. It is just one enormous cliffhanger. Every chapter ends in one. There wasn\u2019t even one chapter where I felt like that would be a good point to take a break. There were chapters that ended in the middle of a sentence. Of course the end itself was a cliffhanger too. It\u2019s not only this what kept me reading though. The story itself is addictive and I just wanted more and more and finally get to know what is going on and make sure these characters were okay.There are a few different characters and point of views who all collide at some point or other. I was fortunate enough to like all of them and found them interesting enough to like to read from each pov rather than preferring one or the other. Everyone of them has their secrets I wanted to get to know more about and I worried about all of them all the time.If you don\u2019t like to read about instalove you might stay away from this. I thought in this case it was just fine like this. Ilsa. J. Bick included this in a neat way so that I didn\u2019t mind.Characters from parallel worlds who might be nothing more than characters from some stories have to fight for their lives against different nightmares and maybe the end of their own story. This is a story of epic proportions that will make you puzzle over what is going on and what is real from start to end. Even with over 500 pages I wish there would have been more and I can\u2019t wait to read its conclusion."}, {"userName": "Aimee Meester", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35622829-aimee-meester", "userReview": "WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS BOOK, OKAY. I didn't have very high expectations for White Space, since I'd seen mixed reviews and heck, I picked it up 'cause I thought the cover was cool and I like long books and those hardly ever turn out well. I was totally wrong. One thing you should know about me is that I don't hand out 5-star ratings willy-nilly. The book has to work hard to deserve something like that. But any book that can be 550 pages long and border on being a horror book, and yet still manage to hold my attention the WHOLE TIME, deserves something big. This is the kind of book you have to read several times to get, I think. It's a lot like Inception/The Matrix/Inkheart all mashed together with a good side of horror, and it's so, so cool. It's not for everyone, and it'll leave your head spinning for a long time afterward, but if you like your books dark and scaring and mindblowing, this just might be for you. It takes place within a short time frame, which is odd for such a thick book, but every single page is stuffed with action and creepiness. I read it in a day. I can hardly read 300 page books in a day! But I just coudldn't put it down, which is probably why I didn't understand half of what the heck was even going on.The characters. Oh, the characters. There are a lot of POVs, and that worried me, since so many people complained about it and I've never been a fan of lots of POVs. But the characters are all so distinctive that I never once forgot who was speaking or had any issues transitioning, so points for that! They were all such realistic teens that you couldn't help but feel for them. AND the romance was minimal, because finally someone acknowledged that they're too busy not dying to spend a whole lot of time kissing and such. POINTS FOR THAT. And the twists. OH, the twists.

First it was lightly poached. Then it started to get a bit fried. Then at the end, it was thoroughly scrambled. White Space is one of those novels that I say without a doubt isn\u2019t for everybody, because it\u2019s confusing as anything and requires twisting your mind in about 5 different directions at once and spending the majority of the book not knowing half of what\u2019s going on.If you don\u2019t have the kind of mind that enjoys those sorts of hypotheticals, and throwing a bunch of \u201cwhat if\u201d questions together all at the same time, then much of what makes this book so brilliant for me will be lost on you. It is, however, a fantastic YA horror novel with powerful imagery that challenges the notions of what teenagers can and cannot handle in their fiction, and for that alone I think this book deserves a greater amount of attention. I can\u2019t wait to read the second book of the duology, due out in 2015, and at least this time I\u2019ll know what a head-trip I\u2019m getting myself into when I sit down with it."}, {"userName": "Lorryn Woodward", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10314856-lorryn-woodward", "userReview": "I didn't hate it but I didn't like it that much either.

Bick is easily going to be one of the best fantasy/horror novels I will read all year and the year has just begun!Teenage Emma Lindsay has metal plates in her head, no parents and an eccentric catatonic artist for a guardian. But those are Emma's regular problems, her stranger problems come when she blinks away and drops into other lives and other times. Other lives that have Emma wondering which is real and which is not.The Emma writes a story called White Space about a group of kids stranded in a haunted house during a blizzard. A story that mirrors an unfinished work by a long dead writer known as Frank McDermott. \"...I don't care Frank. Mom shivers as if she just can't get rid of the really bad dream clinging to her brain, but keeps seeing it happen again and again, no matter where she looks. Do what you have to, but kill them. Kill the book. What do you think you just did, Meredith? You can destroy the manuscript or my notes, but it's still there. Dad presses a fist to his chest. The book's inside. You'd have to kill me...\"Frank McDermott's story is about characters who fall out of different books and jump off the page, much as it seems happens to Emma when she blinks. And now, stranded in a blizzard with a group of young strangers, she is wondering if she is doing exactly what Frank McDermott wrote. If her reality has somehow become the story.\"...Frozen in place, she watches the red slink as it seeps across the road, never spreading, never veering, but creeping up the curb and onto the sidewalk, heading straight for the book. As soon as her blood touches the cover, dragging itself like a moist crimson tongue along the edges, curls of steam rise-and the book...quickens. It's like my blink, when I saw Lizzie's dad-Frank McDermott-at the Dickens Mirror. Except it is a book, not a strange mirror, drinking her blood, greedily sucking and feeding, the pages pulsing and swelling, the covers bulging...and then...\"Emma, along with Eric, Casey, Bode, Rima, and a very special little girl, Lizzie must survive the story that is being written around them. A story more real then the world they live in. Their reality is found not in the written words, but in the white space in between them.White Space is imaginative and brilliant. Ilsa J. Bick has come up with a grandiose concept and plotted and scored it well. Characters from various books who end up in one tale, unsure of what their reality is and convinced that they are real people. But the question that truly rise is which reality is true and will they live long enough to find it.Bick often refers to a 2002-2003 movie called Identity with John Cusack and Ray Liotta. The story is about a group of people who end up at a road side hotel ala Bates Motel and begin to be murdered. There is a killer among them but what they don't realize is that they are in fact different pieces of one man's personality with one trying to become the dominant personality by killing the other's off. Pick it up, it is freaking awesome. White Space is very much like that. The lines between what is real and what is not are blurred and bleed freely into one another. In less gifted hands this story would drown in the mire of its own confusion. But Black is too good of a writer to allow that to happen. In her hands it is entertaining and suspenseful. She engages her readers and knows full well that when you write a novel of this size it is a commitment from both the writer and the reader and Ilsa J. Bick holds up her side of the bargain.White Space is the first novel by Bick I have ever read but I will freely admit I was already impressed by this author. I met her last year at the Tucson Book Festival, she was signing her books and greeting her readers, most of them young adult readers; all with her arm in a cast and sling. But she was there. In the Arizona heat, taking time to care for her readers. White Space by Ilsa J Bick is a terrific read!"}, {"userName": "inga", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4853594-inga", "userReview": "DNFI am loath to but I can't help prematurely throwing the towel and abandoning White Space. I tried. I really did. I gave it an honest chance to wow me. Sadly, it didn't manage to.Giving up on it especially pains me because I had been anticipating White Space for a while, and because I am always reluctant to abandon ARCs.Judging by its premise, Bick's novel has everything going for it. To every ardent lover of reading, the concept of characters jumping between the lines of books must inevitably be fascinating and mesmerizing. To me at least, it was. Unfortunately, however, I stopped reading at the 20 percent mark. Let me elaborate why.The reader is dropped into the story medias in res, without being giving any explanation what is happening. Made-up words are thrown around, never explained, and the reader is expected to follow suit. It doesn't help matters that the narrator of the first chapter is a five-year-old girl, whose line of thoughts was extremely hard to keep track of, a bit reminiscent of stream of consciousness, and some of the things she says seemed like gibberish to me. I read the whole first chapter--which can only be described as cryptic, but which, I assume, will retroactively make sense to the reader--my face a big question mark, trying to get a grip on things. I wasn't, however, discouraged just yet, and so I went on reading.Contrary to what the synopsis claims, White Space isn't just about one girl, but rather about a bunch of characters. So when the second chapter focused on a different character, I was relieved. My relief wasn't meant to last. The second point-of-view-character that is introduced is about ten years older than the first one, but like the five-year-old, she keeps digressing, and jumps from thought to thought. What's more, immediately after being introduced, we jump back in time and are given the character's back story, even though that could have been saved for later in the book.Anyhow, I had problems connecting to the character, mostly because her voice is really flippant, and she jokes about the dead and about death tauntingly and disrespectfully; basically, her brand of humor made it fairly hard to sympathize with her. Her voice is a forced kind of upbeat.Following the next jump of point of view, I found it increasingly hard to focus, and my interest in White Space started waning. Because instead of receiving any kind of explanation as to what is going on, the reader is introduced to more and more characters. In addition to that, after the very first peek into the head of point-of-view-characters, we are immediately given their life stories and how hard done by they are all. But my problems didn't stop there, because every character's voice sounds the same, all utilizing the same kind of forced and not particularly funny humor, and the same kind of flippant remarks are made. In short, there are too many characters introduced in too short a span of time, and the book jumps too much from head to head, for the reader to actually settle in and keep track of what is going on.I want to enjoy myself reading, not try to discern and figure out what in the world is going on and puzzle about what is actually transpiring. Sorry, I'm sure White Space will appeal to patient readers, but it did not particularly do so to me.I received an ARC of White Space in exchange for an honest review via Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Bethany Miller", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237525-bethany-miller", "userReview": "Several of my students read this book before I did and when I asked them what they thought, all of them said the same thing, \u201cIt was confusing\u201d (See below for one 12th grade student's take on it). I decided to read the book to see if my superior intellect and extensive education would allow me to better understand it. After powering through 550 pages, I came to the same conclusion as they did. It was confusing.There\u2019s a lot of shifting going on this novel \u2013 shifts in time and place, shifts from dream to reality, shifts from fiction to real life. There are a lot of characters and the novel jumps from one to the next without any transition or indication of how they are connected. Also, the supernatural elements of the story are mentioned frequently but not explained until the middle of the book when a giant info dump occurs. Not that everything needs to be explained on page 1, but this reader needed to feel more clued in. The Peculiars, the White Space, the Dark Passages, the Dickens Mirror\u2026what does it all mean?! Though the book has some standard horror novel tropes, it fails to deliver any real scares or thrills. As a true scaredy cat who won\u2019t watch horror movies and rarely reads horror novels, I thought I would have to leave my nightlight on and avoid my dark and drafty basement until I was finished reading. On the contrary, I wasn\u2019t terrified, scared, or even mildly spooked. There were some gross out gory moments but that was about it. One of the author\u2019s methods for creating suspense was to abruptly end chapters with a cliffhanger. The stylistic choice to end a chapter in the middle of a sentencefelt very gimmicky and did not have the intended impact of making me want to keep reading. At 550 pages, this book requires a time investment on the part of the reader. The fact that there is no satisfactory conclusion is disappointing. While there are a lot of interesting ideas here, none of them really get fleshed out in a satisfying way. Recommended as an optional purchase where this author has a loyal following.Student Review (12th grader)Grade Range: 9-12Genre: Horror/FantasyRecommendation: Ok- The book will be okay for some people, but not a lot.Literary Merit: Written well, but confusing.Characterization: Characterized well, but in a confusing mannerWhite SpaceWhite Space is a novel with a great idea for a story but is very confusing. There is little to no background knowledge of the family and their life at the beginning of the story. It starts out with the main character remembering a scene of a creepy lady hiding in the corner. Then it goes on to talk about how the main character has a notebook that creates things from imaginary ideas by them being written in it. The characters are not tied up at the end which is probably the result of the book being a part of a series. I think if you want to get into a series and follow through, read this book."}, {"userName": "apollo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28758877-apollo", "userReview": "*Spoiler freeWhite Space is definitely not your normal YA book. I would even go as far as to say that this is not a YA book at all; the only elements that make it a YA book is that the protagonists are under twenty years old, but most importantly this book provides concepts and ideas few authors who claim to write for the teenage audience has attempted to bring into a story.ProsThe characters are believably and likable most of the time, and the plot is interesting enough to make you want to stick with the story. I liked the multiple POVs because it makes the story seem three-dimensional, and it allows for multiple story arcs to happen simultaneously. White Space is a long, detailed book with a lot to say, therefore having multiple POVs I believe really shortened it up. ConsThe writing got a little funky at times, the most indecipherable parts were located at the beginning on the book. I felt it could do without the made up words and the constant references to The Matrix. Bick's descriptions of the environments in White Space were inconsistent, sometimes they were cryptic and it took me several attempts to figure out what was going on, other times they were so detailed I could pick up a pencil and draw them just from reading the text.I feel that this story has so many ideas and concepts being thrown into it that the author never got her thoughts organized before putting them on paper, which changed the book from being a potentially AMAZING story into merely \"interesting.\" Unfortunately interesting is about as far as it goes, and most of the attempts made by the author to make it more than interesting gives the sense that the author is trying too hard to improve the story. This is especially evident at the end, which was so redundant with recurring flaws it was hard to figure out what was happening. These attempts sometimes even gave away key plot devices because they were so desperate in trying to make the story mindblowing, and because of this the story starts to get predictable, making any attempts at plot twists not as surprising as they could have been.OverallDespite the cons you see above I liked White Space, I enjoyed reading it and I want to read the sequel. There's no doubt that I'm going to re-read it, for there is probably a lot that I missed on just my first time reading it. I recommend this book to any one who's fancied the idea of a multiverse, and even more so to those who haven't. I do not recommend this for the squeamish however, this is a violent book with detailed depictions of gore, sudden character deaths, suicide, cutting, mutilations, and things of that nature."}, {"userName": "Chloe", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32102851-chloe", "userReview": "Rating: \u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d (5 stars)White Space is beautifully written, has a cast of characters I am in love with (specifically my darling Casey), and seriously messes with your head. But a lot of people will tell you it\u2019s confusing. Which it is. But not enough that, at least for me, I couldn\u2019t figure out what was happening. Also, it helps add to the story, because ALL the characters are confused and have no idea what\u2019s going on. But, I will admit, there were some things that happened and I was just like how the heck did they get from here to here? What just happened? If the book wasn\u2019t so well-written, maybe this would\u2019ve bugged me. But I adore her writing, so I think this definitely played apart in helping me overlook this book\u2019s flaws. I don\u2019t think anyone should stay away from White Space just because it\u2019s confusing, however. Because it is a really, really great book and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as popular as I think it should be. I agree that the confusing aspect doesn\u2019t make this a book for everyone, but I still strongly suggest everyone at least try it. Just make sure you read slow if you\u2019re worried about this so that you\u2019re absorbing all the words. Like I said before, (multiple times), the writing is just amazing. I think it \u2018s probably my favorite writing style that I\u2019ve ever read. Ilsa J. Bick\u2019s words just flow so smoothly, and her descriptions are so full and filled with rich vocabulary. She also does this thing where she ends a sentence without finishing the thought (usually at the end of the chapter) and completes the sentence in the next chapter, usually with a different character. I just LOVE this. I think it definitely shows just how closely-linked all the characters are. Also as previously stated, this book seriously messes with your head. It\u2019s a bit like Mara Dyer, where at points you\u2019re unsure what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. It also makes you wonder. How would we know whether or not our lives were \u201creal\u201d? What makes something real? All in all, this is a pretty phenomenal book, and I urge everyone to try it out! Don\u2019t be put off by other reviews!

Literally until the halfway mark (and this book is quite a hefty one), I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Constant point of view changes with incredibly short chapters and very random unexplained events had me in a state of perpetual confuzzlement.However, another thing I can say about White Space is that it's a major contender for the most creative book I have ever read. When the truth about the earlier confusing events is revealed, just...wow. The premise behind the story is incredibly compelling.It is sort of like Inkheart, as you may have gathered from the blurb (if you've read it. If you haven't read it, don't. It's better to go into it without reading the blurb because it's kind of spoilery) and also somewhat like Inception (a book within a book? haha) but really, I think I'd class White Space in a category all in its own- both frustrating as well as enthralling to the last word- this is a book like no other.Honestly, it's difficult to review this book properly, and that's mostly because of how differently I view the first half of the book compared to the second half. I, quite frankly, really disliked the first half. If I were to rate the halves separately, it'd get 2 stars, simply because I had no idea what was happening. The only reason I kept reading was to see whether things would finally be explained. And, man, was it worth it. The second half is incredible. Anyone who reads this book thinking that the beginning is crappy, I really urge you to persevere with it, because the second half is completely worth it. I really don't think I've ever read another book where the second half has changed my opinion of a book so drastically.Well, I've said pretty much nothing about the actual content of the book in this review, and I think it's for the best. This is one book that is best read while knowing hardly anything about it. Stick with it, because it's truly worth it."}], "description": "In the tradition of Memento and Inception comes a thrilling and scary young adult novel about blurred reality where characters in a story find that a deadly and horrifying world exists in the space between the written lines.Seventeen-year-old Emma Lindsay has problems: a head full of metal, no parents, a crazy artist for a guardian whom a stroke has turned into a vegetable, and all those times when she blinks away, dropping into other lives so ghostly and surreal it's as if the story of her life bleeds into theirs. But one thing Emma has never doubted is that she's real.Then she writes \"White Space,\" a story about these kids stranded in a spooky house during a blizzard.Unfortunately, \"White Space\" turns out to be a dead ringer for part of an unfinished novel by a long-dead writer. The manuscript, which she's never seen, is a loopy Matrix meets Inkheart story in which characters fall out of different books and jump off the page. Thing is, when Emma blinks, she might be doing the same and, before long, she's dropped into the very story she thought she'd written. Trapped in a weird, snow-choked valley, Emma meets other kids with dark secrets and strange abilities: Eric, Casey, Bode, Rima, and a very special little girl, Lizzie. What they discover is that they--and Emma--may be nothing more than characters written into being from an alternative universe for a very specific purpose.Now what they must uncover is why they've been brought to this place--a world between the lines where parallel realities are created and destroyed and nightmares are written--before someone pens their end.", "title": "White Space\n      \n          (Dark Passages #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13449631-white-space", "average": 3.25, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383505535l/13449631.jpg", "reviews": 375, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/143691.Ilsa_J_Bick", "name": "Ilsa J.
