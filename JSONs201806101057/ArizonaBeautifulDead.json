THEY'RE FUCKING ANGELS, GREGG, READ THE DAMN BOOKS\nThe second book in this absolutely beautiful series. I won't say too much on this until I reread it, because I already put everything in my review for \nJonas\n - read that here.The writing is simple, but the plot line is beautiful. The characters have development and feel mostly real, and they're wonderful, wonderful characters. I have no qualms that I remember about this book, and I highly recommend it! It's a beautiful young adult series, and it's simply stunning. One of those that changed my life and brought me joy and happiness. Let it have the chance to bring you that joy and happiness as well."}, {"userName": "Kirsti", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5581493-kirsti", "userReview": "Alright, so this is the second in the beautiful dead series, and slightly better than the first.So the author still hasn't gotten over her focus on weird names. We have to accept that everyone in the town refuses to consider calling their children 'John' or 'Mary'. Oh no, everyone likes Arizona, Phoenix and Raven. Once you struggle through this, the plot reads almost identical to the first. Darina discovers the murderer, confronts him, and the person who lost someone they cared for kills the murderer. Only difference is I'm not sure if Kyle loved Arizona, or was just using her, but maybe some small part of him did. He did seek justice after all, before his memory was wiped.Flick through all the pointless scenes of Darina and Phoenix making out that has nothing to do with the story (we've established their love is true love, forever and forever blah *eyeroll twitch*) and we have the same story as the first, I'm just more used to the names now.*shudder* I have the third in this series still from the library, but no the fourth and final 'Phoenix'. Do I dare read Summer, and see a third rehash of the same plot?

Darina is once again enlisted by Hunter, Limbo overlord to solve the circumstances surrounding her death. But Darina starts hitting brick walls, Arizona was a secret keeper with a secret love affair and a secret brother. However, when she finally breaks down the barriers in her way, she may face some serious troubles and her own life, as well as Arizona\u2019s autistic brother\u2019s life too may be in danger. Arizona, in Jonas, kind of pissed me off a bit. Pardon the language but in this book she really really grew on me. She seemed, actually almost human in this one. She cared so much about her little brother and even in death, she would protect him beyond belief. I really liked that. She really spoke to me in this book as the voice of reason as Darina was a little bit of butter in the sun, i.e. a melter. She annoyed me so much, along with Phoenix.*tour guide voice* And on your right you\u2019ll see Phoenix being a grade A prat and Darina taking this emotional abuse from him. She was simply worried about the new guy Lee being in pain but Phoenix decides to believe that she doesn\u2019t love him anymore. Whatever. Hunter even grew on me a little bit in this book, if you\u2019ve read my previous review, you\u2019ll understand that I do not like the man one bit. He is inconsiderate to Darina and he\u2019s annoying in his cockiness. However, we get a little bit of an insight into his past in this book and I really liked it, I liked making him seem more human in my head and it left me not hating him completely for a change.The ending was again, rather bitter sweet but my issue is that it was essentially the exact same story as Jonas. Person dies in mysterious circumstance, Darina finds suspicious people, dead person/other person kills their killer. It\u2019s all just too similar and I really hope Summer is different because she\u2019s my favourite character and if her book is awful I might just scream.

This time Darina is helping solve the mystery surrounding the death or Arizona, another one of the Beautiful Dead. Arizona isn't all that forth coming when it comes to helping Darina. The clock is ticking and the time is running out. How long will it take for Arizona to let down the wall? Will she do it in time for Darina to find out how she died? In the end Arizona has to choose between finding eternal peace, and keeping her secrets.So while this book is alittle better, it's not by much. Every time I think I am finally getting drawn in then someone says something stupid. For example: \"Then Pheonix used his zombie powers on him and zapped his mind.\" I was really enjoying the action/suspense scene, but when I read that it was like a reminder saying \"hey this isn't believable\". Yes I am well aware that it is a paranormal book, and therefore NOT real, but come lets be honest. When we get sucked into a good book the line between reality and fanasty get blurred. You get the butterflies in you stomach, the chills up you spine, sometimes it even haunts your dreams. This book just doesn't do it for me. It really is a shame because it could have been such an amazing book if only the dialogue was better. The other issue is that this book ended the same way the first one ended. I don't want to give any spoilers but I will say this...it is almost the same story. I would have liked to see a different outcome or a new twist along the way. Also the ending is very nice and neat. It doesn't leave you needing to jump right into the next one. No cliffhangers and if the first 2 are any indacation then I am pretty sure that I already know what is going to happen in the next one.I will read the next 2 books only because I already own them, but sadly I'm not expecting anything different.

It took me forever to get through it- not because it was hard to read (it was very basic) but it was just so incredibly boring and the characters really annoyed me. No character has ever annoyed me as much as Darina. She's so completely self-absorbed it's sickening. She spends the whole time saying how stupid her parents are (for things like asking her how she is) and being horrible to her only friend. At one point, her step-father is in a car accident and she actually says ''Him being in an accident isn't top of my priority list'' and puts it out of her mind to go hang in her bedroom with her boyfriend.

Parece que la autora recibi\u00f3 mejores consejos y fue capaz de quitar todo ese empalagoseo y aire atormentado que se tra\u00eda Darina en la primera parte. No s\u00f3lo estamos ante una obra mejor, sino que el misterio es mayor, la tensi\u00f3n es mayor, la intriga es mayor. La muerte de Arizona es mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de resolver que la de Jonas, no s\u00f3lo porque la propia Arizona no parece demasiado dispuesta a colaborar sino porque todos dicen que fue un suicidio, pero alguien que conociera m\u00ednimamente a la glacial Arizona sabr\u00eda que eso no habr\u00eda sido propio de ella, adem\u00e1s, si fuera un suicidio, ella no ser\u00eda una de las Almas Elegidas.Cuando Darina empieza a averiguar cosas sobre Arizona se da cuenta de que no es lo que parece ser. Detr\u00e1s de esa chica distante hay una joven dedicada a un hermano peque\u00f1o autista y tambi\u00e9n una chica enamorada, quiz\u00e1s del chico equivocado. Las cosas para Darina no est\u00e1n f\u00e1ciles porque una sospecha se cierne sobre el pueblo y parece que todos est\u00e1n asustados, sobre todo por lo que cuentan que sucede en la cresta, y su madre no parece dispuesta a seguir dejando que Darina campe a sus anchas. Pronto las sospechas recaen sobre una persona y no van a parar hasta saber qu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3 el d\u00eda que muri\u00f3 Arizona. La muerte de Arizona sorprende m\u00e1s que la de Jonas, que parec\u00eda estar bastante clara desde la mitad del libro. Sin embargo, hasta el \u00faltimo momento no sabemos qu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3 realmente con Arizona, quien, quiz\u00e1s, despu\u00e9s de todo podr\u00eda haber decidido adentrarse en el lago en el que muri\u00f3. De todos modos, se ve que el cuerpo policial del sitio no es muy... \u00bfefectivo? porque el tatuaje de alas de Arizona estaba en la nuca, y eso no tiene sentido cuando has muerto ahogado.Darina en esta ocasi\u00f3n no es tan insoportable como en la primera entrega \u2013gracias, Eden, gracias\u2013, pero de nuevo, el supuesto protagonista masculino es un adorno para alegrar los d\u00edas de Darina, aunque aparecer\u00e1n los celos porque llega un nuevo chico a las Almas Elegidas. Arizona, por su parte, es un personaje interesante y complejo, su actitud fr\u00eda resulta ser una fachada que esconde una chica que vive en un hogar algo problem\u00e1tico y tiene que lidiar con lo que es tener un hermano autista. Hunter resulta interesante y enigm\u00e1tico, y parece tener alguna especie de fijaci\u00f3n con Darina, lo cual pone la cosa interesante.En esta ocasi\u00f3n, la narraci\u00f3n es mucho m\u00e1s atractiva y adictiva, se podr\u00eda decir que Maguire ha aprendido y se ha debido aconsejar bien, porque elimina todos esos elementos que hac\u00edan de Jonas un libro flojo y ha convertido Arizona en una novela que no es una maravilla pero es muy agradable de leer y que deja m\u00e1s claras ciertos conceptos que rodean al universo de Cuatro Almas. De todos modos, hay fallos bastante gordos que la autora ha tratado de solventar, pero que poco pod\u00eda hacer ya habi\u00e9ndola cagado en el primer libro.Si te gust\u00f3 Jonas, Arizona es imprescindible. La mejor\u00eda es notable en todos los sentidos y yo, personalmente tengo much\u00edsimas ganas de leer el tercer libro y de descubrir qui\u00e9n es realmente Hunter y por qu\u00e9 existen las Almas Elegidas. Algo diferente y fresco que espero que mejore con cada libro."}, {"userName": "Petra S\u00fdkorov\u00e1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4413166-petra-s-korov", "userReview": "Po del\u0161\u00ed dob\u011b se mi do rukou dostalo pokra\u010dov\u00e1n\u00ed obl\u00edben\u00e9 s\u00e9rie o Kr\u00e1sn\u00fdch mrtv\u00fdch, o zomb\u00edc\u00edch, kte\u0159\u00ed p\u0159i\u0161li zp\u00e1tky z limbu a maj\u00ed rok na to, aby zjistili, jak a pro\u010d v\u016fbec zem\u0159eli.Edenino pojet\u00ed zomb\u00edk\u016f je dosti netradi\u010dn\u00ed.

Dette forts\u00e6tter hun med i denne forts\u00e6ttelse, hvor det er pigen Arizona der er den n\u00e6ste i r\u00e6kken. For snart et \u00e5r siden begik hun eftersigende selvmord ved at drukne sig selv \u2013 Men ingen ved endnu hvordan hun overhovedet kom ud til s\u00f8en eller hvordan hun klarede at holde sig under vandet, l\u00e6nge nok til at d\u00f8 af det. Arizona selv husker ikke meget og det er derfor op til Darina at hj\u00e6lpe hende med at finde sandheden \u2013 P\u00e5 kun ni dage.Igennem denne 2\u2019er bliver den r\u00f8de tr\u00e5d denne gang bevaret hele vejen, samtidig med at flere sm\u00e5problemer dukker op undervejs, som man m\u00e5ske ikke lige havde regnet med at opleve. I det hele taget finder jeg denne bog mindre forudsigelig end sin forg\u00e6nger og det egentlige problem bliver da ogs\u00e5 f\u00f8rst l\u00f8st til allersidst, lige f\u00f8r bogens sidste side. Det g\u00f8r at bogen bliver mere sp\u00e6ndende, fordi du godt nok har f\u00e5et svar p\u00e5 punkt \u00e9t, men ikke p\u00e5 punkt to fra listen. Alts\u00e5 bliver du n\u00f8dt til at l\u00e6se videre, hvis du vil have hele l\u00f8sningen p\u00e5 mordg\u00e5den.Sproget er stadig let-l\u00e6seligt og og flydende, men til geng\u00e6ld med masser af detaljer og gode beskrivelser hele vejen. Man f\u00f8ler virkelig at denne serie er forfatterens hjertebarn og at der er blevet k\u00e6let for hver detalje. Det kan godt v\u00e6re at denne bog er tilegnet Arizona, men de andre glemmes aldrig og bliver aldrig ladt i stikken. Man er hele tiden med p\u00e5 sidelinjen, hvor man opdager at de stadig er der og har det godt. Eller s\u00e5 godt som en d\u00f8d engel, nu engang kan have det.I denne bog s\u00e6ttes endnu flere samfundsproblemer under luppen og tages op til en debat for de unge. Denne gang er der fokuseret p\u00e5 skilsmisser, hadefulde for\u00e6ldre, misundelse og popularitet og selvf\u00f8lgelig stadig den f\u00f8rste k\u00e6rlighed, som er sv\u00e6r at slippe. Netop denne sidste ting m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 siges at v\u00e6re bogens svage punkt, ligesom den var i 1\u2019eren. Man ved at Darina og Phoenix har haft et stormende og hedt forhold til hinanden f\u00f8r hans d\u00f8d, men ved endnu ikke pr\u00e6cist hvorfor eller hvordan. Dette g\u00f8r at man godt nok f\u00e5r alle Darinas f\u00f8lelser ind under huden i hendes kamp for at bevare sin elskede, men de s\u00e6tter sig stadig ikke helt fast, s\u00e5 de bliver h\u00e6ngene n\u00e5r man lukker bogen. Man mangler stadig den sidste brik, for at kunne forholde sig til alle de store f\u00f8lelser. Indtil da, er de der kun p\u00e5 halvt blus og virker bare aldrig helt trov\u00e6rdige eller dybt r\u00f8rende\u2026L\u00e6s alle anmeldelser her"}, {"userName": "Charlotte Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5643108-charlotte-phillips", "userReview": "I am very much enjoying this series of books. for its originality, and its mysterious essence that it seems to contain. For me the book just seems to hold many messages for its readers, in that it really makes you think about the attributes of life, and the consequences that come from our actions. After all we can be the nicest person on earth, but we can still die in unknown circumstances, where a bit of our memory is blanked so we never know what has happened. I like the fact that the novel represents that second chances are not always avalible and at hand, but that when they are, they are time limited and we should use it wisely in order to understand what has happened, and how we can make the correct changes.The book is almost like a discovery of the self, where the characters have to go back over their past to figure out what has happened to them, and that whilst they are doing this they begin to understand what sort of person they were, and how they made others, around them feel. I love the drama that the book contains for it seems that there is always something happening and going on, which means that you never get bored, because there isn't a dull moment in the book. The thing between Darina and Logan though is starting to drive me a little around the bend, because although you don't want her to fall in love with someone else because she has Phoenix, you also want her to, because why should she spend a life alone. you get this feeling that at some point in the books it is going to happen.However in this novel, it was Arizona's stuck up attitude that really grasped me and made me smile. It just seemed to have been written perfectly, in that although a person acts big headed and important, it does not mean that they have the perfect line. I just felt that the author really made the reader sit back and take a look at the aspects of her life, because she made the reader feel for her. By showing that her life was complicated, that she had a lot of things going on in the background, you realize what it is that people do in order to make themselves feel better and alive.I loved the story and I look forward to reading the next two in the series for I feel there is much potential for them and that many young adults will love them.

I reckon I must've been around 14-16 years of age at the time.This was one of the first novels I added / rated when I first joined Goodreads in 2012. Initially, I gave it 5 stars, but alas, I've decided to have a change of opinion. These are my reasons from going from 5 stars to 2.5:- Reflecting back on my 15-year-old self I remeber being a very enthusiastic reader and not the least bit critical. This has certainly changed over the years. Well. I'm still enthustiastic, but I'm definitely more critical as well and I'm sure my rating of this novel (if I were to read it again) would not be anywhere near the 5 stars I initially rated it. However, I don't wish to lower my rating too much, as this novel, at the time, was partly what got me so invested into the hobby of reading.- I remember some elements of this book, but not many stand out in my memory. And I understand that I'm no longer able to give a full, detailed and critical review since a couple of years have passed since I first read this novel.- I have no intention of re-reading this novel; I kept this book on my bookshelf just to remind myself to re-read it someday (in order to write a proper review) but this year, I've come to realize that it's never going to happen as it not longer sounds appealing to me. I've completely lost interest, so much so that I can't even coax myself into picking it up for another try. The plot honestly makes me cringe slightly--it just sounds so cheesy and... young*.*as in: too young for a 19-year-old"}, {"userName": "Victoria Burke", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3131381-victoria-burke", "userReview": "I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to catch on with this book because it is the second one in a series and I will admit I didn't read the first one Beautiful Dead Jonas. It was very easy to catch on the story line and I'm pretty sure if you read or didn't read the first book it wouldn't matter. Each characters has their own story and needs help finding out how their life ended.I loved the main characters and the small characters each with their own unique personalities. They all left me wanting more and wanting them to be happy.In this Beautiful Dead book, Darina has to help Arizona fine out how she died. Arizona doesn't make it easy or helps. That is till Darina discovers Raven, Arizona's Autistic brother. I loved Raven and the relationship him and Arizona shared. She was his shadow and would do anything to protect him from anybody. Arizona had such a strong personality and it shows. I cried when they found how she died. Not so much how but the story behind it and how emotional it was.I love the relationship between Dariana and Phoenix. Phoenix is her boyfriend and part of the Beautiful Dead. They were in a relationship before and now after he died. I love how he protects here but lets her do things her way even if he doesn't like it. I think they make a strong powerful couple.Then there is Hunter, the Beautiful Dead leader. I found him quite strange how he talks about the way he died and his wife with Dariana. But he is also very strong and powerful, it comes through a lot.There were twist and turns in this story, that I didn't see coming. Some I was shocked, and some not so much.

I see them more like enhanced ghosts with special powers and wings and I still love the investigative angle the stories take.This story is looking at the death of Arizona, someone who I didn\u2019t feel very warm towards in the first book but oh my, their are some big reasons in there which explain why she felt she had to come across in that way and as the book moved forward the more and more I warmed to her and actually liked her by the end, especially as she began to open up to Darina about her life.Talking about characters I was surprised to see how strained Arizona\u2019s home life was, I don\u2019t want to give too much away but I don\u2019t think I would of liked to live there. This being said I think kind of understand where they were coming from. Darina was as cool as ever and her relationship with Phoenix was still present \u2013 but still I feel it\u2019s secondary to the main story (at the moment at least).For me the story was a little slow to get going but once it picked up it was quite hard to put down especially as new elements were added and the investigation got into full swing, so much so that the eventual ending did take me by surprise \u2013 even making my hair stand on end in places.I think you could pick Arizona up without too much worry about being lost in the plot as much of the backstory which is actually relevant to this book is weaved reasonably seemlessly into the story which is helpful if (like me) you read Jonas a little while ago.I enjoyed Arizona and I loved the investigative elements and I think anyone who likes a lot of supernatural and a bit of romance will find them an enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "T.

It was filled with new plot twists and I discovered a lot more about certain characters.Considering this novel focused on Arizona, it was great to be able to read more about her history. There was so much going on in her life that I didn't know about, and it really made me understand and like her more. Learning about all of Arizona's secrets was surprising and the mystery surrounding her death kept me guessing all the way to the end. I never saw that coming!These books are always filled with suspense and excitement. I'm constantly on the edge of my seat and wondering what's going to happen next. The plot of this series is so unique and I love being able to experience everything with Darina. She is a head strong and independent main character, and works so hard to make sure all the Beautiful Dead are safe. Her relationship with Phoenix is stronger than ever and their connection is amazing. A lot of new characters are introduced in this book, many of which I liked. Raven was especially great. I'd never read about someone with his condition before and his relationship with Arizona was heartbreaking.Eden Maguire has a great writing style and I had a hard time putting this down once I'd gotten into it. There are so many plot twists and this series is so different from anything I've read before.I definitely recommend picking this series up. It may not be for everyone, but I do enjoy it, and you can understand what's going on even if you haven't read the first book.

I'm happy to report that enjoyed it way more than the first. Even better, the word Zombie wasn't even mentioned once in this one.I do have to point out that this series seems to have some glaring faults. The first being, I'm sure in a sane world, an autopsy would have been performed on Arizona. And the placement of her wings tattoo doesn't make a lot of sense when the description of what actually happened is revealed. In my eyes, she technically did drown. Also, I don't understand what the beautiful dead for 18 months. Darina gets about a week to help them, but even she doesn't do much. Hunter is the one who actually solves the mystery. Why can't he do that all along?Despite all that, I really like the story this time. I think it's because I liked Arizona more. Her life leading up to her death was way more complex that I thought possible. She's hiding so much from everybody, and it's interesting to watch all the facts unfold. And what really happened was crazy. Not to mention the events that occur right after we learn the truth. I don't think justice was truly served.I also liked Phoenix and Darina's relationship in this one. It seemed more real and not nearly as rushed. I also think Darina is starting to build more character, although I really wish there would be more of a connection with her mom. Plus, the other character are starting to have more life.

In the fast pace second installment of the Beautiful Dead series there are surpises, twists and turns. There wasn't a slow moment in this book.From what you learn of Arizona in the first book in the series she's your typical snobby girl, who has nothing to hide and nothing to lose. She literally made me crazy while I was reading, she was so NOT helpful to Darina, but then she shows you a different side of herself and I wanted to hate her but couldn't!It frustrated me beyond belief.Phoenix and Darina's relationship makes me absolutely lovestruck. They are literally the perfect couple, minus the fact that Phoenix is dead. They face more obstacles in this book and I long for them to be together, and for Phoenix to be alive so he and Darina can be happy without a time limit.There was a surprising amount of violence in this one compared to the first, but Maguire twined it flawlessly into the story. New characters are introduced while Darina is solving Arizona's mystery and some of them come at your too fast and I found it a little hard to keep track of some of the characters and how they fit in but it wasn't so bad that it took away from the book at all.I had to tell myself to close my mouth once I finished, I really can't wait for the next book in the series.
