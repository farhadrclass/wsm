It is how I got started reading Christian fiction, one problem with it, is that some how I seem to have started with the best and often have a hard time finding anything that really meets the par. Things are great and enjoyable, but not quite as exciting as those first  Liz Curtis Higgs or  Tracie Peterson and even  Francine Rivers'  Redeeming Love. Well, boy is that not the case with Mary Connealy! Welcome to my favorites' shelf! (Literally I do have a favorites' shelf, if my mom didn't have half my books from it, I'd post a picture). (Ugh, it was a library book... I'll have to get a copy to put on my favorites' shelf....)Petticoat Ranch is everything that a good historical fiction should be, and I'm glad to have read it. I'm a southern gal through and through, and I'd like to think myself a Southern Belle. I'm really invested in my genealogy, and I have my family tracked for years to the late sixteen century in the Carolinas, and Virginia, and then later Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Texas. I guess one way to put it, is to say that I'm completely biased. I love the bumper sticker that says \"North 1 South 0 Half Time\". Not that I'm saying \"yay to slavery\", but I know the stories, and have read journals of my own family members and have seen how cruel some of the North was against them. Not saying the South were angels, but I'm partial to my rebels, as they are my own blood. With that said... It's often hard for me to ever feel much for a story with Norther ties and empathy.Not at all the case with this book. I so feel for the characters, they are completely real to me, and I'm fully on their side! This book was incredible. I cannot count the times that I giggled, or rolled my eyes. I have no recollection of how many times I scoffed or said, \"MEN!\". I am quite unsure of how many times I snickered and had a little evil laugh, feeling I'm sure the emotions of Sophie and her girls. In all cases, it was plenty, and I definitely was smiling through out this novel. That is, when I wasn't scowling and wanting revenge for my own self. The sermons were perfect and powerful, and so true to how God works. The reactions of the characters was real, and the men were not overly flowery, but were such \"men\". (A problem often found with women authors, but not so with this book in my opinion. With that said, usually male authors have problems with their female characters in my mind too.) Sophie is such a strong woman, struggling to keep it all together, and I just love her personality. The girls are fabulous, and I really giggle and evil giggle with Beth loving what she's up to. I really cannot praise this story enough, now that I think about it. So many different personalities are captured within the different characters, and the main two commandments of Love from Jesus Christ reverberate through the pages. Even the most stubborn of a person can see a little insight into themselves through these pages."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3450884-barbara", "userReview": "I\u2019ve never read a book by Mary Connealy before, and after slogging through this western romance, I probably won\u2019t read another.The book begins by introducing us to Sophie, a widow with four daughters. She hides out in a small run-down shack to avoid the man who killed her husband, Cliff. When another man rides past her shack and over a cliff (!) she and her daughters rescue him. Turns out, he\u2019s Clay, Cliff\u2019s identical twin brother. There\u2019s a thing called willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn\u2019t work her. In the span of 48 hours, Clay who fell off a cliff and survived rides into town. Why isn\u2019t he bedridden with broken bones or a concussion? And how, in the span of only a few days, can Sophie give up her independence for a marriage of convenience to Clay? Clay buys back the family ranch in order to move Sophie and her daughters there, but then the vigilantes who killed Cliff return. The characters are flawed and unlikable. The daughters are capable when under Sophie\u2019s direction but otherwise are whiny and simpleminded. Clay is very na\u00efve when it comes to marriage and dealing with women. Considering that he\u2019s well-traveled, it seems strange that he doesn\u2019t understand the first thing about women. Sophie vacillates from being dependent on Clay\u2019s kindness and strength to being independent and wanting to take care of her daughters alone. The Christianity in this book isn\u2019t subtle, and I\u2019ve read other books that do a much better job at showing (rather than telling) the message that Connealy seems to be trying to get across. For fans of this author only."}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5633520-heidi", "userReview": "3.5 stars Sophie Edwards is recently widowed and now finds herself a single mother doing the impossible. Raising four daughters on her own, in the 1800's, in the state of Texas. She's an amazing mother, and a strong, capable, independent woman. Clay McClellan is on a mission to find his long lost twin brother and instead discovers his brothers widow along with a whole passel of little adorable girls. This book had one of the most intriguing beginnings of any book I've read in a very long time. It definitely grabbed me from the start and I had a really hard time putting it down for the first half. I loved the story-line and the humor of our poor hero thrown into the family of a bunch of girls. So cute. Clay is completely clueless but it is entirely endearing. I absolutely adored the first half of this book and all of the characters. The second half did drag for me and I found it quite predictable, though still enjoyable. It does become quite preachy, but the author fits it in well with the story and it becomes pretty crucial to the ending.

It was an interesting turnaround for both main characters--one with no experience with females, one with some negative experience with males. Of course, the timeline shortened dramatically the amount of time both had to make the necessary changes to their hearts and minds, but it is amazing what one can do and how one can change when one determines to live life God's way. I loved the relationship between the girls and their mother, and how they used their own imagination to expand upon what she was taught. I also appreciated the way the author dealt with the intense anger that would be normal in the circumstances she described without weighing down the entire story with heaviness and hopelessness. I can't wait to read more of this series."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1718434-ruth", "userReview": "Sophie Edwards is used to taking care of herself and her four daughters after her husband's death. Her constant prayer is, \"Help me, Lord\" while she does what needs to be done in the small shack they live in. Then one night, a stranger shows up and almost dies. She and the girls rescue him and find out he is Clay McClellan, the twin brother of her deceased husband. Feeling obligated to care for the woman and children his long lost brother left behind, he corners her into marrying him. She puts up a fight but decides to go along with it in order to have her ranch back. However, there's trouble brewing. Judd Mason wants that ranch and makes a plan to kill them in order to get it. Meanwhile, Clay feels inferior to his brother who seems to have done everything right while he (Clay) keeps messing things up. Sophie is determined to do the chores and fix up the place as she's always done, and her daugthers, who adore Clay, pretend to be helpless in order to soothe his ego. So Sophie and Clay constantly butt heads and argue, but even in the midst of it, there's humor. Mary Connealy does a remarkable job with comedy, and this light-hearted book will be a fun read for anyone in the mood for a little romance and suspense."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919132-linda", "userReview": "Others have reviewed it so I'll just tell you why I didn't care for this book. I hate to be the negative one here but I found it hard to believe that the strong widow and mother Sophie, who has managed on her own for several years can meet, marry, start a sexual relationship, and not communicate well with her new husband.... and this all happens in a span of a few days. And if Clay was as bad off from his injuries, how did he manage to suddenly ride into town when 48 hours before he was near death? I really wanted to like this book.

I've been wanting to read something by Mary Connealy for awhile after checking out a couple google previews. I wasn't too impressed by this one, though. The action was good. It was suspenseful enough to keep me interested. The romance, however, wasn't so great. I don't need loads of romance in a book for me to like it, but this just seemed rather...rough. There is no build-up to the main characters falling for each other. Pretty much Clay tells Sophie they're going to get married, they get really mad at each other a few times, she gets pregant and suddenly they're in love.

It was a fun mix of romantic comedy, mixed with classic western, swirled with a bit of The Goonies! A romantic-comedy-western-super-hero(ine) almost comic-book style of story. I kept seeing it as a movie in my mind. Some unsatisfied reviewer said it was hard to suspend their disbelief, but this book wa supposed to entertain not be realistic! I loved the device used at times when say, Clay would end a section with the thought that it was the best day ever, then Sophie would begin the following section with the thought that it was her worst day ever, or vice versa...this and other things elicited several out loud chuckles during reading, I can tell you! The only reason not to give it five full stars would be that there were patches of uneven writing where it took a couple of seconds to figure out how the scenes had switched, but other than that, So.

He was so totally insensitive, and, goodness, he was so demanding! He did have his sweet moments, though I was unfortunately informed they weren't completely sincere. He seemed more protective in the end and that was more endearing, albeit somewhat irritating. That was kind of sad how he thought he couldn't measure up to his deceased brother. I thought his rules were annoying but, at the same time, cute. And hilarious. And that was funny how he thought he'd figured out women. No man that has ever walked this earth ('cept for Jesus, of course) has ever understood women.Sophie was pretty awesome. She was strong, determined, sweet, and, well... awesome. Western Super Woman. I was right beside her with her irritation at her brother-in-law/husband. He got downright infuriating at times. But she was so cool, standing against those outlaws and ruffians. And the traps she'd rigged was so amazingly creative and sneaky.The girls were so endearing. Mandy was sweet, and wise for her age, and so like her ma! Oh my word, she was so great fast at hogtying! I had no idea! Beth was so in control, and practical. She's awesome at the traps as well. From reading Doctor in Petticoats, I thought she was older than Mandy. She just seemed older, more mature. Sally was impossibly adorable. I love how she latched onto Clay; that was so sweet! That was so cute how she refused to believe that Clay wasn't her pa. And that was so utterly tragic how they thought Clay didn't love them anymore when he raised his voice. Boy, their dad must've been a two-faced jerk!Judd - What a lowdown varmint! Oh, he was infuriating! I really liked Harley Shafter in the end. I think he really will change. I'd like to know more about him.I absolutely loved Luther! He was so sweet, and protective, and strong, and wise. I'd noticed him in Doctor in Petticoats, but I didn't know he was so sweet. Adam was nice too. I don't blame him for his anger. That is so cool how they could hear her prayers. I really liked that.I really felt sorry Miss Grace Calhoun. She does need to get down off her high horse though. Her proper this, proper that, proper everything was annoying at best.I decided to read this book because it was on hand and because I needed my history straight for the Sophie's Daughters series.While I did enjoy this book (it was by Mary Connealy, of course I enjoyed it), the romance was out of character. Mary's known for writing Christian romantic comedy. I think she might have forgotten the romance in this one. Yes, it did have romance in it, but she passed up a few would-be romantic parts that she's clearly taken advantage of in other novels (Kincaid Brides Series). For example: Sophie agrees to marry Clay. A few months later, she suddenly discovers she's expecting. It doesn't say a word about her married life. Because of the lack of information, I had supposed they had separate bedrooms. And she doesn't really explain the couples\u2019 feelings much when it comes to romance.Once again, it was a great read, but I really missed the romance."}, {"userName": "Jessica Lindenberg", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63163251-jessica-lindenberg", "userReview": "It was not very entertaining.

Needless to say I found myself shaking my head a couple times while trying to read this first book in the Lassoed in Texas series. As a note I actually read the last book in this series first and it didn't really make a difference.Sophie is a widowed women with four young daughters. She's been hiding out in the bush after her husband's lynching to protect herself and her daughters from the townspeople out to marry her off over the freshly dug grave. But then, on a stormy night, a man who looks just like her husband ends up in her care after a fall. Its his long lost twin brother Clay and he decides to do right by the family and marry Sophie. He buys back his brother's old ranch and that's when the problem starts. A band of vigilantes who have been up to no good killing people and now they want the ranch one way or the other.The characters were pretty awful in this book. I might give a way a little bit but some of this stuff just made me so incredulous. For one, the daughters are a whiny crying mess all the time, yet when its just their mother with them they are capable and cool headed. While I realize different people react differently around certain people, it was just too much of a difference to be believable. Then there was Clay. He was a complete idiot when it came to all aspects of life and marriage and considering the way he traveled around, it just didn't seem like he would be that naive about everything that came to women and their feelings or even interacting with people in general. Sophie was ok. She bounced back and forth between being dependent and independent and I was never quite sure where the motivations for her actions came from.The plot was actually decent; had the characters been able to pull it off. There was a lot of intrigue and excitment. But then there came the \"call\" that was put out by Sophie for help that men hundreds of miles off were supposed to be able to hear. I know this is Christian fiction but really? It just seemed pretty far-fetched. The Christianity in this book was also very preachy, down to the fire and brimstone preacher sermons they all attended. Some of her other books do a much better job at showing rather than telling the message she's trying to get across.Not a very good book by Connealy.

I have wanted to go back and read how it all began and finally a few months back the Kindle version of the whole trilogy was released. What I liked: Sophie and her girls are great you can\u2019t help but fall in love with them. They are strong Texas ladies and letting a man into their life was quite fun to read. I also enjoyed meeting some of the side characters. Plus the story of Sophia praying to God for help which in turn had people coming from 100\u2019s of miles away to help her was really neat and a cool way to show how God is always their for us.What I did not like: The one thing that kind of bothered me was the rule Clay made with the girls about no crying. I know its part of the story line and parts of that carries over to the series about them, I just thought it was kind of stupid. But watching Clay run every time a girl cried was funny! Over all this was a great book and I really enjoyed it and can\u2019t wait to read the other two books in the series. I just love Mary\u2019s writing style and how she tells her stories. I really can not get enough of her and can see myself going back and rereading her books at some point which is not something I do a lot.

The best part of this book is the humor. I cracked up at the way she wrote things. And the idea of the story is pretty good. It was heavy on the sermonizing but a good deal of that occurred in church so you'd have to expect that right? I liked the theme of justice instead of vengeance and while it seemed over the top that every sermon seemed to scream directly at the two main characters I have experienced that myself so it isn't really far fetched. I also liked how God answered Sophie's prayers very directly through other people since that is how things generally work in life. Her help was pretty profound and maybe answers aren't always so obviously given in most people's lives but help usually does come through other people. One thing I didn't like was how the story suddenly switched to people who had not been introduced to the story and I had no idea who they were and if they were good guys or bad guys. I got confused and kept wondering what I had missed in my reading. and maybe I did miss something. Clay was certainly annoying in his asserting power over Sophie and her girls especially when the girls had been so self sufficient before he showed up but there is something to that in the time period. Women were expected to obey their husbands. But the whole, \"Don't worry your pretty little head Darlin'\" attitude is terribly condescending in any time period. While Clay was annoying in insisting on everything being his way, he was also very sweet about having all those girls in his life. I'm glad he started figuring out how to deal with them by the end of the book. Spoiler: I thought the daughters pretending they didn't know how to ranch to make Clay feel manly was pretty hilarious. And his \"teaching\" them did give them some one on one bonding time so it could be counted for good.Spoiler: I wasn't really convinced about Harley's change of heart happening so quickly.

While there is an element of romance, and it is indeed set in Texas, there is a lot more to it than that. The story centers around a young widowed woman raising four girls on her own. After her husband died, Sophie Edwards was forced to leave her home and move her four young girls into the wilderness. Though having always been a tough woman capable of survival, Sophie was forced to expand her skills, and instill the survival instinct in her daughters.One night a stranger is badly injured nearby.
