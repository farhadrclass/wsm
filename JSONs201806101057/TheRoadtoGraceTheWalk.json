South Dakota has the smallest Jewish population in the U.S....under 400! Mr. Evans writes that Leszek didn't come to the U.S. until his wife died 9 years ago. That in itself is a rarity for a holocaust survivor...most certainly would not go back to Poland. He said he came to be with his son who is now in California. How did the son come to be in America? Why did Leszek remain in South Dakota? Too many questions surrounding this character that appeared to be dropped in just to bring a basic awareness of the holocaust. I wished Alan spent some more time with this humble man and developed his story a bit further. Still, I seem to care about Alan and wonder if he will ever see Analise again. And after the ending of this third installment, next spring seems like a long wait to find out how Alan will fare with his latest setback."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2073368-angie", "userReview": "This is the third installment in \"The Walk\" series. This book was definitely focused more on the walking: he walked this many miles, ate this, slept here, saw this, etc. Which, though interesting if I were also traveling along there, became rather tedious after a while. I really liked the second book, which was were Alan spent most of the book recovering from a stabbing that he incurred at the end of the first book, and so there was more in depth character development and story line.But that said, the message in this book was very powerful---on forgiving---which I would have rated the full five stars. We learn that \u201cto forgive is to unlock the cage of another\u2019s folly to set ourselves free.\u201d (pg. 125) I've got my own issues in life, in trying to truly forgive a family member for some deep hurts. I know in my mind that I want to forgive and am trying my best to feel that way, but it's hard to always feel at peace and not let the bitterness, anger and hurt seep back in again, once you've thought you let it go. I also loved the thoughts that to learn Grace is to discover God. It is way too difficult, if not impossible, to truly forgive someone without the grace of God. Because, if we continue burden ourselves with a heavy load of not forgiving, \"we chain ourselves to what we do not forgive.\u201d (pg. 115)This is my favorite quote about grace: \"What we fail to realize is that grace is more than our destination, it is the journey itself, manifested in each breath and with each step we take. Grace surrounds us, whirls about us like the wind, falls on us like rain. Grace sustains us on our journeys, no matter how perilous they may be and , make no mistake, they are all perilous. We need not hope for grace, we merely need to open our eyes to its abundance. Grace is all around us, not just in the hopeful future but in the miracle of now\"...

I do not remember why I decided to buy this book. More than likely I heard about it in another book I was reading. I started reading it without reading the outside cover, which I always do. So for the first 90 pages or so I thought it was a true story, but it turns out to be a novel. The book is actually a series. It is so interesting. The author makes me want to go on a walk like the character in the book. The character (Alan Christoffersen) starts out in Seattle, WA, 2 days after his wife (McKale) dies and starts walking to Key West, FL. He meets several different and interesting people along the way. He also describes many historical, fun and tourist attractions. The places he describes had me goggling them to find out more information. He describes them very well in the book. Each chapter starts with a quote (these represent thoughts Alan is writing in his journal), which I have listed below. Some of these quotes you will not understand until you read the book. This is the 3rd book in the series and I will be reading all of the other ones. Here are the quotes for each chapter:I had a dream last night that McKale came to me. \"Where are you?\" she asked. \"South Dakota,\" I replied. She stared at me without speaking and I realized that she didn't mean my location. \"I don't know,\" I said. \"Keep walking,\" she said. \"Just keep walking.\"One can never know what a new road will bring.There are people such as Benedict Arnold or Adolf Hitler, whose names become synonymous with evil and more adjective than proper noun. For me, \"Pamela\" is such a name.I don't know if poltergeists or ghosts exist, nor do I care. There's too much I don't understand about the world I inhabit for me to worry about a world I haven't been to yet.To say that one doesn't know when to quit is either an insult or a compliment, depending on the outcome.Last night I dreamt I was kissing McKale. As I pressed my lips against hers I was filled with the most exquisite joy. Then my joy turned to horror when I realized that I wasn't kissing her, but giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.My stalker has forced my hand.Once you have opened the book to another\u2019s life, the cover never looks the same.My father used to say, \u201cPity is just a poor man\u2019s empathy.\u201dAs we walk our individual life journeys, we pick up resentments and hurts, which attach themselves to our souls like burrs clinging to a hiker\u2019s socks. These stowaways may seem insignificant at first, but, over time, if we do not occasionally stop and shake them free, the accumulation becomes a burden to our souls.My hair is getting long. I\u2019ve got to find a barber before someone mistakes me for a rock star.Heroes and angels usually arrive in disguise.Leszek [my favorite part of this book] has taken me into his home to care for me. Would I have done the same for him? I\u2019m ashamed to answer.Whether cautionary or exemplary, there has not yet been a life lived that we cannot learn from. It is up to us to decide which ours will be.To forgive is to unlock the cage of another\u2019s folly to set ourselves free.I once heard a preacher say, \u201cThe reason we sometimes connect so quickly with a complete stranger is because the friendship is not of this life, but is the resumption of a friendship from another.\u201d I do not know if this is true, but sometimes it feels true.I have discovered the ladies of the Red Hat Society. Or, more accurately, they have discovered me.One cannot judge someone by the city they\u2019re from, any more than one can judge a book by which bookstore sold it. Yet, still we do.The trapped are less concerned with rules than escape.She is a rose, blooming amidst cornfields.You can always trust a man wearing a John Deere cap.The man who robs a corner convenience store is a thief. The man who robs hundreds is a legend. And the man who robs millions is a politician.History bears witness that our lives are far more influenced by imagination than circumstance.Today I met a self-described tramp with a most unfortunate view of God.Life is not to be found in a cemetery.What\u2019s wrong with me? Something\u2019s broken.D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.To learn grace is to discover God.I recommend this book to everyone!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine", "userReview": "In this third instalment of the series we once again walk with Alan Christoffersen, eight months into his pilgrimage, this time through the Dakotas and Missouri. Once again there are a few adventures along the way and most assuredly the heartwarming tales that Mr. Evans is famous for. I have read all three in The Walk series and enjoyed them. It is Alan\u2019s story and with him I enjoy the people he meets along the way. This one is no different, although I was not pleased with the ending. Kind of saw it coming, but now have to wait until next Spring to know the outcome. But, alas, that is the sad reality of reading a series. If I were forced to note one bad thing about this book it would be that it had a little bit of a \u201ctravelogue\u201d tone to it that the first two did not.

This book entertained as well as inspired I guess would be a good word. As I get older my tastes change and Richard Paul Evans writing fills part of my plate with a taste of let me say Grace. His stories let me see part of people that I may otherwise miss because one can't see inside another mind but this writer lets us do so if for just a little while. I'd like to think Mr. Evans may continue his saga for I would like to go with him from the comfort of his writing. I don't know who may read this maybe no one but myself but again it is my belief that a 5 star rating is a rare thing. Maybe if there were a way to go 1/2's I would have done so beyond the 4 I have listed. I look forward to more of Mr. Evans writing as well as some of my other favorite writers. At age 56, I guess I'm making up for lost time of not reading as a kid because I had to. Now I read because of want and delight in a good book such as this one. Hopefully this may help inform some person and introduce them to Mr. Evans style which I find comforting. I have yet to be disappointed in any of his many books."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/925478-kristen", "userReview": "This book wasn't nearly as good as the first two in the series. It's beginning to feel as if Evans is trying to draw out the series on purpose...perhaps to earn a better paycheck? No. That's not fair. It was a lovely book, though it felt a little disjointed to me. I'm also finding that I really like the supporting characters much more than the hero himself. I'm wondering when some sort of personality is going to show up. It's difficult to get a sense of who he is, what he stands for, etc. Of course, that may be part of the author's ultimate tactic. It almost seems that Alan is a bit of a chameleon, his personality and character changing with each encounter. Quite frankly, that is beginning to annoy me a bit. Still, it is fun to read about the different locales he visits. But seriously, these last page, cliffhanger endings are driving me nuts! I'm invested in the series and look forward to the rest of the journey, but I'm hoping the next books will be on the same level of excellence that I found in books one and two."}, {"userName": "Janean", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483819-janean", "userReview": "I loved this story about forgiveness and grace.

Each time I read the next installment, I find a renewed desire to go for a long walk myself, to take a few days (or weeks or months, if I could afford the time away) to wander the country and experience the world at a slower pace. I think is is one reason I would rather travel by motorcycle than by car. Even though it takes the same amount of time, by bike it seems that I experience the world more closely...I am in it, and not just watching it go by. I smell the fragrances of roadside windflowers, feel the breeze and the sun (or rain), all of my senses are engaged. Some day I would love to take a few months to walk the Appalachian Trail, or the Camino de Santiago, or just to pick an interesting region and wander. Evans' books engage my imagination in that way, but they do more...they bring to life ideas and feelings and convictions that I have felt, but perhaps don't fully understand. In pondering upon his characters' experiences and thoughts and conclusions, I find my own understandings expanded. I am sorry for those who, in their reviews, described it simply as mind candy.

He\u2019s got gumption, drive and once he makes up his mind to do something, nothing can stop him.Knowing how caring Alan is towards everyone he\u2019s met, I was a little thrown off by his reaction to Pamela. His whole loving demeanor changed when it came to her. I know that there were deep hurt feelings where she was concerned, but I felt he should have been a little more welcoming to her, considering how far she went to get him to talk to her. But in the end, he did forgive her and they both got closure.The encounter that Alan had with Analise threw me for a loop. I understand the emotional state they were both in, but the way things went between them just didn\u2019t feel right to me. That being said, it made the book even better for me. People aren\u2019t perfect. We do things we shouldn\u2019t do and mess up from time to time. It made Alan seem more human to me. I like a few blips here and there in the books I read.

He has his support system in place and each mile walked brings new people and new revelations.As he is leaving a hotel one morning, a woman calls his name, she looks vaguely familiar but Alan cannot put a name to the face.

In real steps, lays out a path for anyone to follow to find grace. Reveals the life-giving, soul-renewing water of forgiveness. I especially like the descriptions of how to forgive and why it is important to do so. When we do not forgive, we give the perpetrator of harm (thief, manipulator, murderer, cheater, self, and so on) the power to control at least one aspect of our lives. And with just one part of our lives under their control, we can never be free to complete our journey, enjoy or journey, or live our journey. The victim that refuses to forgive is worse off than the perpetrator.I also liked the description of things that happened in Sydney. How some people's \"love\" becomes a prison for those they love. And the importance of presence and touch and closeness. Without the entanglement of sex. There are times when what feels so right just isn't. The sorrow and grief must be walked through. Sometimes with others. Sometimes alone. But it cannot be assuaged or numbed by sex. Or other pain killers.

The author has a way of telling stories in the main story that have morals and lessons that can help the reader in their own lives.You continue to follow Alan as he walks cross country on his trek to Key West,Florida. He meets many different kinds of people and gets to know some more than others. Some leave lasting impressions that help shape his character and try to find his place in life after losing his wife, his business and his house. A definite read! But start with book #1 and work your way through. #4 A Step of Faith will be release May 7, 2013."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28637701-laura", "userReview": "RPE keeps surprising me, and I just can't put his books down. I'm so moved by the main character, Alan, and both laugh and hurt with him. I'm really looking forward to the next two in the series and will be disappointed once I'm through.I would recommend these to anyone who is questioning their faith and/or is grieving the loss of a loved one."}, {"userName": "Summer Vespestad", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17036071-summer-vespestad", "userReview": "I like the way Richard Paul Evans writes.

Join one of America\u2019s beloved storytellers on a walk like no other: one man\u2019s unrelenting search for hope. Reeling from the sudden loss of his wife, his home, and his business, Alan Christoffersen, a once-successful advertising executive, has left everything he knew behind and set off on an extraordinary cross-country journey. Carrying only a backpack, he is walking from Seattle to Key West, the farthest destination on his map. Now almost halfway through his trek, Alan sets out to walk the nearly 1,000 miles between South Dakota and St. Louis, but it\u2019s the people he meets along the way who give the journey its true meaning: a mysterious woman who follows Alan\u2019s walk for close to a hundred miles, the ghost hunter searching graveyards for his wife, and the elderly Polish man who gives Alan a ride and shares a story that Alan will never forget. Full of hard-won wisdom and truth, The Road to Grace is a compelling and inspiring novel about hope, healing, grace, and the meaning of life.", "title": "The Road to Grace\n      \n          (The Walk #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12275907-the-road-to-grace", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1332451732l/12275907.jpg", "reviews": 1140, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/46097.Richard_Paul_Evans", "name": "Richard Paul Evans"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Inspirational", "Christian Fiction", "Adult Fiction", "Christian"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12275907-the-road-to-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13545250-the-road-to-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11337912-the-prisoner-of-cell-25", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161361.The_Christmas_Box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12988089-rise-of-the-elgen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7187395-the-walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6517407-the-christmas-list", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
