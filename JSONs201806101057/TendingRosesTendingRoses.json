I read a lot of really awe-inspiring books this year but this book \"Tending Roses\" will stay with me.Lisa Wingate has written perfectly (at least for me) a book about family relationships, the wonderful and also the not so great. She created a grandmother that was wise but also contrary and sometimes down right mean. A real person...I read this with the eyes of a grandmother, but a grandmother that also (with my husband) worries about mother-in-law who has health problems, who is wise and also sometimes contrary and down right mean.I also see my children and their families...A book that can make the reader think and contemplate as well as entertain and leave the reader feeling good is extraordinary and this story did that for me."}, {"userName": "Loraine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922494-loraine", "userReview": "SUMMARY: The lessons that most enrich our lives often come unexpectedly. That\u2019s what Kate Bowman learns when she moves temporarily\u2014with her husband and baby son\u2014to her grandmother\u2019s Missouri farm. The family has given Kate the job of convincing Grandma Rose, who\u2019s become increasingly stubborn and forgetful, to move off her beloved land and into a nursing home. But Kate knows such a change would break her grandmother\u2019s heart.Just when Kate despairs of finding answers, she discovers her grandma\u2019s journal. A beautiful handmade notebook, it is full of stories that celebrate the importance of family, friendship, and faith. Stories that make Kate see her life\u2014and her grandmother\u2014in a completely new way\u2026REVIEW: This book definitely made on to my list of 2015 favorites. I loved how Grandma Rose's journal magically appeared and had the perfect entry to address Kate's problems at exactly the right time. The entire story line was so beautiful and full of love and faith. The emphasis on the importance of placing focus on family rather than on bigger, better and more materialism resonates in today's world. This book was so filled with gems of wisdom from Grandma Rose that I will let these nuggets of favorite quotes show you how amazing this book is. I look forward to reading the other 2 books in this series.FAVORITE QUOTES: (I actually had 19 but will post about half of them!)\"Grown up life has a way of doing that to you--taking up a little more and a little more of your time until you're never together, and when you are together you're exhausted.\"\"My father used to say: 'The man who buys what he does not need will often need what he cannot buy.\"\"But is life a success when it doesn't include time for after-school talks, and curling up to read books on winter nights, and weaving daisy chains in the summer? Is it a success when you have all the big things but none of the small ones? Is it as it should be when everybody grows up and moves to opposite coasts and doesn't care if they ever see each other?\"\"Raising children is an occupation of self-sacrifice, but these days young people don't want to give anything up.\"\"You must remember that when people are unkind to you and try to make you feel as if you are less than they are. Your Father in heaven made every strand of hair on your head and every ounce of flesh on your bones. You are perfect, and beautify, and just the way you are intended to be.\"\"I wished it were that simple for Ben and me--just read a map and suddenly we would know where we were meant to end up and how to get there. But growing up is never that easy, no matter what age you are.\"\"Young parents, hold your children a liottle longer today. Kiss them when you put them into bed tonight, say their prayers with them,sit by them while they fall asleep. Your children are the greatest gift God will give to you, and their souls the heaviest responsibility He will place in your hands. Take time with them, teach them to have faith in God. Be a person in whom they can have faith. When you are old, nothing else you've done will have mattered as much.\"\"Sometimes when you're doing good for other people, good things happen to you too.\"\"Sometimes it's easier to have sympathy for strangers than it is to have sympathy for your own family.\"\"When you feel burdened, listen to the laughter of your children. Take delight in them. They will make your load seem light.\"\"The secret to a happy life is not in getting what you want. It is learning to want what you get. Don't waste your time crying over what you're not given. When you have tears in your eyes, you can't see all the beautiful things around you.\""}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/826559-jen", "userReview": "I needed to hear the message of this book. As a homemaker and a full-time mom it really inspired me to slow down and really savor the fleeting precious moments of motherhood. I am normally very passionate about learning new things and can easily get caught up in my own interests. This book helped me to remember that I'll have my whole life to devote full-time attention to them. While I do take time for myself, I take great satisfaction in nurturing the passion for life and learning in my children.

She asked Kate to take her shopping but had to stop at the church to do something first. Kate was peeved with her husband and didn\u2019t want to see him at the church where he was using the internet, working. She knew they needed to talk but she just didn\u2019t want to deal with him. She was ticked. As they were heading there, Grandma asked what this road was that they were on, and where it lead. Kate answered her. A few moments later Grandma asked the same question, and Kate, confused, answered her the same way. A few moments later, the same question, only this time Grandma asked if they had gone that way yesterday, to which the answer was yes, they did drive that road. By this time Kate is thinking she had to take Grandma to the doctor; that she was losing it. Grandma then asked if they will go back that way, and the answer was yes, they always go back that way. Then Grandma, looking straight ahead, asked the neighbor girl in the back seat, \u201cIf we got on this road trying to go somewhere else, how would that be?\u201d, to which the little girl laughed and said that would be stupid. Kate, looking to her right, realized her grandmother wasn\u2019t out of her mind, but that Kate was being reeled in like a guppy. Grandma said that going down the same road expecting to end up somewhere else would be disappointing, and not very smart. Ah, I love that story.

They want to put the grandmother in a nursery home and this mother is on maternity leave and so she goes and stays with her grandmother until the family can decide what to do. The family hasn't been really close since their mother died 6 years ago. The grandmother leaves a journal in places that her granddaughter can see. At first she thinks that she is snooping and reading the journal but then she looks forward to the times that her grandmother leaves it for her to read. There is so much wisdom that comes from the grandmother. I enjoyed reading it and have done so several times. I have given out to many people and everyone loves it. There are other books that follows in this series that were good and continues the story. Lisa Wingate has another series that I have heard is superb as well.

So far I have read it three times and I still am not tired of it! I especially enjoy Grandma Rose's character. She is real; down-to-earth, not merely a 'fluffy do-gooder Grandma' type, but also able to offer stability and advice to her granddaughter, Kate. The author does not gloss over Grandma Rose's faults but because they are so realistic (for example, the piles of clutter in her home that she defensively pretends to be 'normal' and does not want her family to notice), endear her to the reader all the more.In a society that more and more devalues the elderly and commitment within marriage, this book has been a refreshing read.A book that emphasizes the importance of family, relationships, and working through differences, presented in a good story setting."}, {"userName": "Brandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/936713-brandy", "userReview": "Some people may say that this book is on the boring side. I personally loved it. It is about a young lady who goes to stay with her aging grandmother. They don't have the best relationship. Not your typical grandmother/granddaughter relationship. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that I loved it because I read it shortly after my grandmother passed away and I didn't have the greatest relationship with her either. The book didn't make me have any regrets but it did create alot of emotions that were good to work out. Even if you didn't have a relationship like the one in this book with your grandmother, I think it is a worthwhile read and would recommend it to anyone looking for another good read."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/313885-lori", "userReview": "Bleh.

Grandma Rose is such a wonderful, memorable character, sometimes cranky, but always loving and wise.

It was a nice read to start during Christmas, since the book takes place during that time as well. I wasn't too sure about this book at first, but any doubts I had flew out the window shortly after I started reading it.Tending Roses is about a couple, Kate & Ben, who go to stay with Kate's Grandma during the holiday season with their four month old boy, Joshua. Kate's presence at her grandmother's home is more of, make sure she doesn't burn the house down. The rest of Kate's family, her sister, dad, and aunt will be there shortly before Christmas to tell grandma that they are moving her to a home.However, while Kate is there and learns more of her grandmother's life the more she realizes taking her grandmother away from her farm would be a mistake. Although this is an important realization the one she has about her own life and family is by far more life changing.I am thinking of buying this book for every new or young mother out there, because at the heart of this book it is a warming tale of the uncertainty we face in life, but how in the end if we keep faith, things may just work out for the best."}, {"userName": "Jenny Bates", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/982529-jenny-bates", "userReview": "Okay, I am going to say outright that I did not read this whole book. I skimmed it. I know the general gist of it... I did open random pages throughout the book and read a couple of pages at a time. But I just could not bring myself to waste my time with the whole book. It was silly. I did not care for it at all. I get it... we, as a generation care too much about things. We should be staying home with our kids instead of working so we can have luxuries. I already believe this. Lesson was not needed. So, I close the chapter of my life that included this book... it was more like a sentence, rather than a chapter. No, I would not even dedicate an entire sentence.

Kate learned valuable lessons from her elderly grandmother. The book was a bit predictable,some details were lacking, and some things were rather unrealistic - but it was still good.

In the \"sandwich generation\", she is also taking care of her four month old son with some help from her husband. I really appreciated the way Ms. Wingate portrayed Ben, her husband. Although life was not working out the way they had expected while living in Chicago, he manages to roll with the punches, usually with a grin, although he is not perfect. Thank goodness! Ben and her grandmother's stories are what make this book resonate with humor, sadness, hope, and love. I only wish there had been more, especially where she and her Dad were concerned. I would have liked to see them work through their problems in more detail. Overall, a lovely book.

You expect a lovely warm grandmother-granddaughter tale, but this grandmother is not always very lovable! But with a series of stories in a journal about her life left for her granddaughter Kate to find, Grandma Rose shares lessons she has learned and regrets she has about the way she has lived her life. As a young mother, Kate is struggling with decisions about the kind of life SHE wants. She learns to look past Grandma Rose's prickly exterior and sharp words to really see the scared aging woman. It serves as a great reminder to look past hurts and slights by family and friends to find the core of our love and caring.
