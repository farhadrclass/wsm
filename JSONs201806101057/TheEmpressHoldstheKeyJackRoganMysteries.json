This is a masterpiece in its genre. The historical research behind is very well reflected in all the author\u2019s books, so well described, it captures you from the beginning. So many turns in the plot, twisted ventures, action a must, trips to many cities,keeps you on your toes throughout the book. The background of the characters is superb, giving you an insight worth the read. The prose sometimes is so poetic, it transports you to the time and place realistically. I\u2019ll defin read all his books!"}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6604348-carla", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. But it moved from past to present, from country to country so often that I got a bit confused at times. Still, it was a good read."}, {"userName": "Melissa Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15977297-melissa-lee", "userReview": "The Empress Holds the Key is a very faced paced suspense-thriller that keeps the reader intrigued from start to finish. The amount of research that must have gone into the writing of this novel is quite impressive. To be able to tie in so many different time periods (from biblical times, ancient Egypt, to the Knights of the Templar, World War II and finally present day) shows the true dedication and knowledge of the author.Even though this is said to be the second book in the Jack Rogan Mysteries, it can be read as a standalone novel. In fact the plot follows other characters more than it does investigative journalist Jack Rogan. Most specifically Officer Jana Gonski and lawyer Marcus Carrington. However Jack does play an important role in uncovering the mystery.Apart from the World War II era storyline, I must admit that the other time periods aren\u2019t something I would generally read about. However I became so drawn into this story and the suspense of it all, that I often had a hard time putting it down.I would recommend Gabriel Farago\u2019s The Empress Holds the Key to fans of Dan Brown\u2019s Robert Langdon series and those who enjoy suspense novels."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229150-peter", "userReview": "Thrillers tend to be plot heavy and character thin. Usually, however, the primary protagonist is more complex by necessity since he must drive the plot like a race driver behind a Peugot.Gabriel Farago\u2019s history based thriller, The Empress Holds the Key, is unusual in that instead of a single protagonist, he gives us half a dozen main characters. As a result, each character of necessity is secondary to the underlying story, which is not always a blessing. In several instances Farago\u2019s plot moves past a character so fast loose ends are left behind. Jack Rogan, an investigative reporter, seems to be the primary protagonist early on along with Jana, a woman he dated in the past and who comes back in his life with a case that interests both. Someone is out to hurt Jack for a reason he either doesn\u2019t know or refuses to share with Jana. His car is scratched and side-swipped, and when that doesn\u2019t scare him off, he\u2019s beaten up so badly he\u2019s hospitalized. Then two inexplicable things happen: Jack submits an investigative piece from his hospital bed despite suffering from a concussion and broken bones and Farago never explains who did it or why.With Jack out of the way (for the moment), we think Jana is the novel\u2019s protagonist, but her turn passes to an attorney who is an amateur Egyptologist, who then shares the stage with a violinist composer who is a Holocaust survivor. Additional point-of-view characters include a Egyptian police detective and several of the antagonists. In addition to Nazis, Holocaust victims, Vatican officials, Islamic terrorists, and Knights of the Templar, there are plenty of minor characters who come and go\u2013\u2013sometimes quite violently.As for the plot, which begins with the discovery of artifacts that link a prominent Australian banker to Nazi Germany, the story\u2019s complexity often gets in the way of logic. What makes the story even more complex is that we\u2019re several hundred pages in before we discover that the plot revolves around a search for the tablets on which Moses wrote the ten commandments. Needless to say, Farago strains logic from time to time in order to make it all hang from the same hook. The most extreme example is the violinist/composer\u2019s origins and connection to the underlying mystery. It seems he\u2019s not really Jewish after all since his father was a Catholic priest who sent his son to be raised by a Jewish family with a secret that he didn\u2019t know he was carrying. Here\u2019s how the author explained the connection to me in a private email: \u201cThe Abb\u00e9 Berenger Diderot is a central character. He is a French priest who discovered the famous Templar archives hidden in his church in the 1890's. . . Diderot had an affair with a famous French opera singer, Francine Bijoux, and they had a son - also called Berenger after his father. The boy was put up for adoption and ended up with a Russian Jewish couple, the Krakowskis. . . Berenger Krakowski is the father of another one of the central characters, Benjamin Krakowski, the famous violin virtuoso and composer, who escaped from the German concentration camp with his brother.\u201dAfter you\u2019ve memorized the above, you still may get hung up on Farago\u2019s method of disposing of characters. Jewish characters in particular are vulnerable to quick demise. There\u2019s the Holocaust survivor who falls asleep while Jack and Jana interview her, the Jewish husband of the Nazi\u2019s daughter who disappeared, and the Jewish clock repairman who is executed by the Austrian police for reasons it\u2019s hard to fathom. Now for the good news. Farago has put a lot of research into this story in order to create an aura of plausibility; he also writes well. I didn\u2019t encounter any typos or grammatical errors. So, if you aren\u2019t bothered by twists that occasionally miss their turn, you probably enjoy the ride. Thrillers after all are supposed to take you to another reality. To that extent, Farago succeeds."}, {"userName": "Karen greer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40644685-karen-greer", "userReview": "Simply wonderful book.

The author takes the reader on a ride from the middle ages to WWII to now developing the main characters into very believable people.
