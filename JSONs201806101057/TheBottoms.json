Harry grew up in East Texas along the Sabine River area. An area where more is picked up at the local store than groceries. \nHarry and his sister Tom find the body of a black woman who had been mutilated and tied up with barbed wire. His father Jacob is the constable/barber/farmer in the town and he takes the body to the black section to have a black doctor have a look to see what happened. This unleashes racial tension in the area because the black people don't want trouble stirred up and some of the white people don't care if a black woman is dead. Then more bodies start turning up. Lansdale brings this to life much better than my piddly review but I wanted to just get the basics across.  Harry was that curious boy who believed and had seen the legendary \"Goat Man\" following he and his sister in those woods.\nHis dad Jacob reminded me of Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" He stood up for what he thought was right no matter what. There is a lynching scene in the book that I had nightmares about after reading this last night. (trigger warning for some of you) Then there is Grandma: I want to be her when I grow up.\"I love and miss Grandpa, but I'm glad he's dead.\"\"Don't say that!\" Mama said.\"Was he in a lot of pain?\" Daddy asked.\"No. No. Thank goodness for that. But he took to singin' gospel songs. He'd just burst out in one from time to time, and he couldn't carry a tune in a syrup bucket with a lid on it. It was miserable. And you couldn't shut him up. I figured it was time for him to go just so I wouldn't have to listen to that. I ever start talkin' to myself, or heaven forbid sing a goddamn gospel song-\"This book as a mystery novel would have scored a 2 star from me, but it's more than that because if you spin me a tale involving a coming of age story and throw in some folk lore and you have me entranced. This is what Joe Lansdale does with this book. Just a short time before I had been a happy kid with no worries. I didn't even know it was the Depression, let alone there were murderers outside the magazines I read down at the barbershop, and none of the magazines I read had to do with this kind of thing."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\n\u201cOnly the past seems to matter now; only it seems to be alive; only it can support my soul.\u201d\nI finally got around to reading this over the weekend and have been debating ever since about how to write a review. This is one of those books that if too much is given away, then everything might as well be given away. It also has a blurb that is about 112 pages long so go read that if you want way too much information. As for me? I\u2019m going to let the book do most of the talking. This is the story of Harry Collins \u2013 a man who is near the end of his life and is recalling a monumental time when he was just a boy . . . \n \u201cI\u2019ve got the memories of then, nearly seventy years ago, and they are as fresh as the moment. It all happened, as I recall, in the years nineteen thirty-three and thirty-four.\u201d \nThis was a time when Harry and his family lived in East Texas, specifically near the Sabine River bottoms . . . \n \u201cThe bottoms themselves were beautiful. The trees lush, the leaves heavy with rain, the blackberry vines twisting and tangling, sheltering rabbits and snakes. Even the poison ivy winding around the oak trees seemed beautiful and green and almost something you wanted to touch. But like the poison ivy, looks could be deceptive. Under all the beauty, the bottoms held dark things.\u201d \nThe dark thing Harry and his sister Tom(asina) had always been afraid of was someone known as the \u201cGoat Man,\u201d but when Harry was 11 years old he discovered the true evils of the world in the form of murdered women and the reality of what kind of person would automatically be suspected of such heinous crimes . . . \n \u201cMy people, they like chaff, boy. They blow away in the breeze and ain\u2019t no one cares.\u201d \nThe book also delves into the battle of conscience Harry\u2019s father, the constable, had to face throughout the process . . . \n \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve opened this box and I don\u2019t know how to close it.\u201d \nFor months now friends have been trying to get me to read Lansdale. I finally caved and my first selection was a classic B-Horror Movie type of story with The Drive In. I was convinced to read this one next when a certain monkey-wielding book fairy forced it down my throat. I can\u2019t express how happy I am that she did so. I\u2019ve been terrified to read Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d release and decided to stand firm and maintain my memory of the original which has kept its place as one of my favorites of all time. Color me shocked when I discovered that the author who is famous for the antics of Hap and Leonard would also be the person to write a coming of age story that was so reminiscent of To Kill A Mockingbird. If you were a fan of Scout and Jem or found Atticus to be as close to a superhero as you would probably ever meet in real life, I can\u2019t recommend The Bottoms enough. This was a real thinker about how little some things have changed, it's written so well you'll think you are in Texas during the Great Depression and it is guaranteed to make you feel allllllll of the feels . . . . \nDon\u2019t trust me?

Lansdale. \u00a0In truth I think I may have come across a short story or two in one anthology or another, but this is my first novel. \u00a0It will not be my last.The story unfolds on a farm, set deep in the woods by the Sabine River in East Texas during the depression era of the 1930\u2019s. \u00a0\u00a0Our narrator is Harry Collins, an eleven year old boy who lives on the farm with his parents, younger sister Tom ( short for Thomasina) and his trusty dog Toby. \u00a0They also have a mule, Sally Redback for ploughing and such. \u00a0\u00a0Harry\u2019s father farms his land, owns a barber shop where he cuts hair and is the local constable. \u00a0Wearing so many hats was not uncommon in those days and went a long way in helping to make ends meet. \u00a0\u00a0One day while out in the woods with his younger sister, Harry and Tom stumble upon the corpse of a naked, coloured woman. \u00a0She had been badly cut upon and was all bloated and tied up in barbed wire.While Harry and his sister are making their way back home in the dark, after having made their grisly discovery, they have the chilling sense that they are \u00a0being watched and followed. \u00a0Lansdale describes this and the Bottom land of the Sabine River country so effectively it is as though you are \u00a0actually there, on high alert with these kids as they swallow their fear and navigate through brambles and bushes enroute to the swinging bridge that will take them across the Sabine River and to a \u201csafe\u201d route home.The bridge was some cables strung across the Sabine from high spots on the banks. \u00a0Some long board slats were fastened to the cables by rusty metal clamps and rotting ropes. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know who built it or how old it was. \u00a0Maybe it had been a pretty good bridge once. \u00a0Now a lot of slats were missing and others were rotten and cracked and the cables were fastened to the high banks on either side by rusty metal bars buried deep in the ground. \u00a0\u00a0In places, where the water had washed the bank, you could see part of the bars showing through the dirt. \u00a0Enough time and water, the whole bridge would fall into the river.When the wind blew, the bridge swung. \u00a0The boards creaked and ached as if in pain. \u00a0Little bits of rotten wood came loose and fell into the river below. \u00a0Down there was a deep spot and the water ran fast, crashed up against some rocks, fell over a little falls, and into the wide, deep, churning water. . Lansdale is a gifted storyteller. \u00a0The Bottoms reads as though Harry were right there in the room with you recounting those days. \u00a0More bodies of unfortunate women will be discovered in the days and weeks to come and they will not all be women of colour. \u00a0Harry\u2019s Dad, Jacob, being the local constable takes steps to learn more about this first woman. \u00a0He cannot count on the white doctor in town to give him an unbiased appraisal of how she met her death or for that matter even care much about such things. \u00a0Frustrated Jacob seeks the counsel of a coloured doctor that lives and practices within a settlement of mostly coloured folk not far from his own community. \u00a0This does not set well with the white people of his community or the local members of the Klan. \u00a0Primarily The Bottoms is considered a mystery but where it really shines is as a coming of age story. \u00a0Given the racial divide and the role Harry\u2019s father played I was reminded often of Harper Lee\u2019s classic as well as McCammon\u2019s Boy's Life. \u00a0As you approach the end of this book Lansdale pumps up the volume and infuses every word with nail biting tension. \u00a0I could not take it in fast enough, my eyes, \u00a0independent of will, were racing ahead chasing down each sentence, leaving no time to digest, imploring my fingers to come on already, turn the page and let them loose. \u00a0At some point I suddenly gasped for air, unaware that the whole time, I had been holding my breath. Whew! And Woot!. \u00a0Highly recommended. \u00a0You really will not want to miss this one."}, {"userName": "Paul Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7553206-paul-nelson", "userReview": "The Bottoms by Joe R. Lansdale The Bottoms by Joe Lansdale is a rousing atmospheric murder mystery with an abundance and it has to said, more than its fair share of tension and thought provoking issue. The Bottoms won the Edgar award in 2000 and is definitely a book that will stay resolutely in your thoughts long after you've finished.\u00a0The story is an unforgiving coming of age tale for eleven year old Harry Crane set in the 1930's who along with his younger sister discover the tortured body of a dead woman in the Bottoms of small East Texas town, Marvel Creek.\u00a0'In that moment, something else changed for me. I realized that a person could truly die. Daddy and Mama could die. I could die. We would all someday die. Something went hollow inside me, shifted, found a place to lie down and be still, if not entirely in comfort.'\u00a0Harry's father is the town constable and he begins an investigation that delves deeply into the racial divide prevalent in the era, nearly breaking him in the process. Caught smack bang in the middle are the two children who insert themselves into the forefront of proceedings as the murders increase and the town seek justice.\u00a0The characters virtually leap from the page and sit snugly on your shoulder whispering their intent, leaving an impression of the story permanently etched in your mind. Eliciting disbelief at attitudes, questioning morality and leaving you firmly rooting for a family that face exorbitant trials and tribulations.\u00a0There's even some of the Lansdale humour littered sparingly within, some anxious store-bought teeth.\u00a0'Once in a while be wore store-bought teeth, but they clicked and clacked and slid around when he talked, as if they might have some place to go and were anxious to get there.'\u00a0The Bottoms is a delightful story that brings back fond memories of classic stories such as To Kill a Mocking and McCammons Boy's Life while still remaining unique and quite gripping in its own way. The characterization and the feelings inspired by this story are simply breathtaking at times, perfectly highlighting how times have changed. I did guess the killers identity from the various suspects tossed into the mix but it didn't detract from a wonderful story that deserves to be appreciated by all."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "The Bottoms: Joe R. Lansdale's Edgar Award Winning Mystery\nThe Bottoms by Joe R. Lansdale was chosen as a group read for February, 2016, by members of On the Southern Literary Trail. Special thanks to Jane for nominating this novel.\n\nJoe R. LansdaleJust a few weeks ago my neighbor handed me a copy of By Bizarre Hands, the first anthology of short stories by Joe R. Lansdale. My neighbor is a professor of literature. I take his recommendations seriously. It was my first exposure to Landsdale. I was impressed.I finished the anthology a few days before travelling to Texas. I usually travel with a book set in my destination. I chose The Bottoms to take along. While some may question my classifying this novel as a work of Southern Literature, Texas is a mighty big State. It consists of distinct geographic areas, populated by very diverse people. Cross into Texas from Louisiana and you find yourself in East Texas, marked by huge tracts of pines, riversswamps, and the bottoms of the Sabine River.The area is decidedly \"Southern\" as opposed to Cowboy country. It is the land of \"The Big Thicket\" that covers miles of territory which was known as a place in earlier days into which one could go and rarely be found if that was the traveler's intention.\nThe Big ThicketLandale's novel is narrated by Harry Collins, now in his nineties, the resident of a nursing home. Recognizing his mortality, he tells the tale of life with his family in the Great Depression of the 1930s.Thirteen year old Harry was the son of a loving mother and father, and doted on baby sister, Tom, short for Thomasina. Yes, Tom is a tomboy. Harry and his family are better off than most. His father is a farmer, a barber, and most important, the town constable. Both his parents have a strong moral code stressing the value of human life no matter the color of another person's skin.Should the reader think this is sounding familiar, it should. This is Lansdale's move of To Kill a Mockingbird from Alabama to Texas. As Jem and Scout were intent on bringing Boo Radley out of hiding, so Harry and Tom are fascinated with an elusive figure known as \"The Goat Man.\"\"The Goatman\" is a well known Texas folklore legend. Outside of Denton, Texas, stands the old Alton Bridge, built in 1884. A black goat farmer Oscar Washburn lived nearby. In 1938, for reasons unknown, he was dragged from his family home, and lynched by hanging from the Altmon bridge. When the Klan came back to check on the their handiwork, Washburn's body was gone. Through decades, the Goatman has been sighted on the Alton bridge, sometimes as a figure leading herds of goats, sometimes carrying the heads of two goats, and sometimes as a figure half man and half goat.\nThe Goatman's BridgeKnown also as a writer of horror, it comes as no surprise that the Goatman appears as a central figure of interest courtesy of Joe Lansdale. The only change being that the bridge has been transformed into a deteriorating swinging bridge. Come on, it's near Halloween. Just go with it.\nThe Goatman of Texas LoreHarry and Tom are accompanied on their adventures by an unforgettable dog named Toby. Although severely injured, Toby is indestructible and a loyal companion to his kids.While out squirrel hunting, Harry and Tom find the body of a black woman, mutilated, and bound in barbed wire. Their discovery becomes the first of a series of murders. Constable Collins doggedly pursues the killer, although the white population shows no concern. Of what value is a dead black woman who was nothing more than a prostitute?Racism rears its ugly head. Following in the footsteps of Atticus Finch, Collins is determined to solve the murders. His white neighbors dub him a \"nigger lover.\" Things rapidly turn uglier when a white woman becomes a victim of the mysterious killer. The Klan comes out and lynches an innocent black man. Jacob Collins crawls into a bottle when he is unable to prevent the Klan from carrying out hanging Oscar, the man in the wrong place at the wrong time. Poor Mose has lived alone since the disappearance of his wife and brain addled son years ago.The town settles down until another white woman is found dead. This victim is no prostitute, but a respected member of the community, sought after by many suitors. Think \"Miss Maudie.\"Jacob Collins wreaks vengeance on the ring leaders of Mose's killers. He climbs out of the bottle to bring the real killer to light. Harry and Tom begin their longest journey one night, just as Jem and Scout did. Tom is the killer's intended victim. And the Goat Man comes out just as Boo Radley did.The Bottoms is a satisfying read. However, I would have found it more satisfying had it ended with Jacob sitting up in Tom's room, knowing he would still be there the next morning.There are flaws in this book. There are numerous sub-plots setting up other possible suspects that Lansdale's solution is to wrap them up in an extended epilogue by Harry which borders on the tedious. I found Harry's lengthy conclusion less than satisfying. I leave it to the reader to make their own determination.Perhaps this is Joe Lansdale's homage to that masterpiece of Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird. I'll give him the benefit of a doubt. This novel is an expansion of his young adult novella,Mad Dog Summer found in Mad Dog Summer: And Other Stories. Lansdale is currently producing a film of The Bottoms, starring Bill Paxton.Joe R. Lansdale is a prolific writer. The Bottoms captured the 2001 Edgar Award for best mystery. He has won the British Fantasy Award, the American Horror Award and has scooped up nine Bram Stoker Awards, and was voted a World Horror Grand Master. He is the author of the popular Hap and Leonard Series. His latest novel is The Thicket. Lansdale, born in Gladewater, Texas, now lives in Nacogdoches, Texas, where he is the writer in residence at Stephen F. Austin."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[9/10]We have no Halloween traditions in Eastern Europe, but since I read so many books published in the US I got into the habit of picking up in October some titles that don't usually migrate to the top of my reading stack. I don't mind horror: it's not my favorite genre, but I have found some real gems in the past. 2014 is the year I tried my very first Joe R Lansdale story, and I have chosen The Bottoms both because I noticed it received some literary prizes and because it is a standalone, not part of a series. My reaction is quite enthusiastic, mostly about Lansdale storytelling talent, equal in my opinion to the likes of Stephen King and Robert McCammon. Speaking of McCammon, The Bottoms has as the main narrator Harry Crane, a young boy who needs to come to terms with death and with racial prejudices, reminding me of Boy's Life. Harry has a little sister, a tomboy named Tom, and she is not the only aspect of the story that pointed me in the direction of the classic To Kill A Mockinbird. There's also the strong father figure, the mysterious neighbour called here the Goat Man, again the racial tensions and the lessons that will last for a lifetime. Lansdale though cannot be accused of imitating these other writers : his story is darker, scarier, and the real monsters are sadly not some supernatural creatures from the swamp, but the people living next door.The setting is as much a part of the story as the humans. East Texas during the times of the Great Depression was a backward place, sparsely populated and almost isolated from the rest of the country, a swampy place of poor soil and tangled forests where the easiest transport was by boat on the river: We lived back in the deep woods near the Sabine River in a three-room white house Daddy had built before we were born. We had a leak in the roof, no electricity, a smoky wood stove, a rickety barn, a sleeping porch with a patched screen, and an outhouse prone to snakes. For Harry Crane and his sister the Bottoms are a place of constant adventure, a hunting ground for squirrels and rabbits, a fertile source of scary stories passed down from generation to generation. There are rumours of a Goat Man who hides in the forest and only comes out at night to steal unwary children, and of a travelling bluesman who made a pact with the Devil in order to be able to charm the audience with the tunes of his guitar. The bottoms themselves were beautiful. The trees lush, the leaves heavy with rain, the blackberry vines twisting and tangling, sheltering rabbits and snakes. Even the poison ivy winding around the oak trees seemed beautiful and green and almost something you wanted to touch.But like poison ivy, looks could be deceptive. Under all that beauty, the bottoms held dark things ... Once, when the two siblings are caught up late in the forest, they came upon the dead body of a woman, horribly mutilated and tied to a tree on the banks of the river. Childhood and innocence are about to be terminated for Harry as his father, the local constable, is unable to make any progress in the investigation. On the contrary, it soon becomes apparent that this was not an isolated case, but the work of a serial killer. The fact that the victims are black prostitutes only serves to underline the deep social division between the white and the black communities, the power that the \"Kluxers\" still had in that period to intimidate, to persecute and ultimately to kill while good people were afraid to speak up. As Miss Maggie, an old coloured friend of Harry, explains: It ain't gonna be. You can rest on that. My people, they like chaff, boy. They blow away in the breeze and ain't no one cares. Whoever done this have to kill a white person if he gonna get the big law on him. Lansdale merit in tackling segregation and hate is in how strongly he makes the issue personal, not some political or philosophical debate, but a choice you have to make at one point or another in life and then to practice what you preach, even if it gets you isolated and attacked by the bigots and the bullies. Harry's education is written not in schoolbooks 9the school is actually closed for lack of teachers), but in the blood of the innocent victims of prejudice and in the even more painful lesson that adults are not infallible, when the father he worships has his own moment of despair and resemnation. Just a short time before I had been a happy kid with no worries. I didn't even know it was the Depression, let alone there were murderers outside of the magazines I read down at the barbershop, and none of the magazines I read had to do with killers who did this kind of thing. And Daddy, though a good man, sincere and true, if briefly distracted, was no Doc Savage. In the same vein, maybe I'm repeating myself, but these things need to be said out loud, today as much as in the 1930's: It's easy to hate, Harry. It's easy to say this and that happens because the colored do or don't do one thing or another, but life isn't that easy, son. Constablin', I've seen some of the worst human beings there is, both white and colored. Color don't have a thing to do with meanness. Or goodness. You remember that. The plot is not a simple murder investigation or a story of racial hatred. If it were, I don't think it would stay long in my memory. What I really got from the book was a sense of the place and of the people living there, of the importance of family and traditions, and of the importance of the strong moral backbone, of the integrity and honesty that will see you through even when you live at the bottom of the social ladder. The adults around Harry are imperfect, even the closest to him have their secrets and their weaknesses and their moments of doubt. There's also a way out: Harry loves to read. It's mostly pulp magazines and cheap comics in the beginning, but the boy will soon discover the pleasures a lending library can bring even into the most backward of places.Regarding the prose of Lansdale, all I can say is that it has a natural flow, a rhythm borrowed from the oral traditions. For local colour it uses a lot of colourful similes that show a streak of healthy peasant humour : My Daddy used to say there were skeeters over there big enough to carry off a man and eat him and wear his shoes. another example, about some rednecks bullies: They had, as Daddy said, the manners of a billy goat. I once heard him say to Cecil, when he thought I was out of earshot, that if you took the Nation family's brains and waded them up together and stuck them up a gnat's butt and shook the gnat, it'd sound like a ball bearing in a boxcar. Lansdale can also write whimsical and poetic passages, when the story requests it, as when the elderly Harry Crane contemplates the changes brought about by several decades of progress to his bottom lands: But the beautiful woods are all gone now, cut down, cemented over with car lots and filling stations, homes and satellite dishes. The river is there, but the swamps it made have been drained. Alligators have gone away or been killed off. The birds are not as plentiful, and there is something sad about seeing them glide over concrete surfaces, casting their tiny shadows. All in all, an excellent choice for Halloween and for fans of crime or Southern literature. I will probably read next the Hap and Leonard books by Joe Lansdale, as I am pretty sure that he can continue to deliver the goods."}, {"userName": "Tom Mathews", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews", "userReview": "Every time I finish a Joe R.

Having just finished The Bottoms, I am really, really, really determined to make Joe Lansdale one of my best friends. This standalone novel, written in the guise of an old man\u2019s reminiscence, is an exceptional combination of murder mystery and coming-of-age tale set in East Texas during the Great Depression. Harry Collins, 14, lives with his family along the banks of the Sabine River. His father, Jacob, has donned many hats (farmer, barber, town constable) in his struggle to stay afloat during the lean years of the Depression. One day while hunting with his sister, Tom (okay, Thomasina) they find the mutilated body of a black woman tied to a tree near the river. Soon more bodies turn up and the hunt is on for a killer. While Jacob is searching for a human killer, Harry and Tom are convinced that they have already seen the killer, the legendary Goat Man, rumored to stalk the river bottoms in search of prey. Things get complicated quickly when one of the victims turns out to be white and the local Klan gets involved. Although this is an original tale in its own right it also has many undeniable similarities to To Kill a Mockingbird which I found inexplicably entertaining. Ordinarily I would find copycatting Harper Lee presumptuous in the extreme and earn the author a good horsewhipping. Lansdale, however, gets a pass from me because his remarkable character building skills and storytelling ability kept me fully engaged all the way through to its bittersweet ending. On the downside, the whodunit aspects of the story aren\u2019t as challenging as they could be so readers who consider the author\u2019s skill at concealing the killer\u2019s identity important, you may not be too impressed. If you are like me, however, and are just along for the ride, you will likely find it enjoyable. 4.5 stars (rounded up because, well damn it, because I can and I want to!)FYI: On a 5-point scale I assign stars based on my assessment of what the book needs in the way of improvements:*5 Stars \u2013 Nothing at all. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.*4 Stars \u2013 It could stand for a few tweaks here and there but it\u2019s pretty good as it is.*3 Stars \u2013 A solid C grade. Some serious rewriting would be needed in order for this book to be considered great or memorable.*2 Stars \u2013 This book needs a lot of work. A good start would be to change the plot, the character development, the writing style and the ending. *1 Star - The only thing that would improve this book is a good bonfire."}, {"userName": "J.K.

He tells of his growing up in the family farm in the Bottoms, of their struggles during the great Depression and the grizzly murdered women that they discover in the Bottoms. He tells of his wonders of his youth and his delight in learning of those around him during his coming of age, of his quest and mystery in search of the identity of The Goat Man. His poor Dog Toby a limp but courageous dog that you'll never forget and his equally brave and lovely sister Tom. That loving kind ma and his grandma really a character to remember his father a stand up righteous kind of guy, a tough law man that wishes to see beyond skin colour. They faces problems with K.K.K members in the search for the murderer. As the story progresses more peoples true colours start to show. The Bottoms be a place you would love and hate to live, mark my words it sure is a place and a story to remember of as long as you live. It pays homage to the great novel To Kill a Mockingbird, has everything that story stood for and leaves the reader with a similar awe. Well deserved of the Edgar Award. This story is just as good as his new novel Edge of Dark Water also taken place during the depression era with equally wonderful and memorable characters.The story is presented before you in easy flowing storytelling way, a poignant tale of human endeavour against odds, yet another Joe Lansdale great story with wonderful prose. A joy to read full of heart and horrors, a fully immersive reading of a great story.Once completing this story you would be in regret due to no longer being in company with these characters just as the main protagonist mentions in his recollections... \"Each time i visit now, close my eyes to go there, i hope when i awake i will no longer be of this world, but one where Mama and Daddy, Tom and Grandma, perhaps even Mose and the Goat Man, and of course good old Toby, will be waiting for me.\"Watch out for a movie adaptation that is going to be released, this would be a really good movie especially starring with Bill Paxton as an actor.\n\"Just a short time before I had been a happy kid with no worries.

Lansdale in the \"Southern Authors I need to keep an eye on\" file (if I may be so bold as to lump someone from East Texas into the \"South\"). I was consistently delighted by my first encounter with his work, the creepy cool 1930's-era Texas Gothic thriller The Bottoms. Much as I found Wiley Cash (another Southern author I've discovered recently) a straightforward, no-nonsense storyteller, Lansdale's style doesn't make room for ornate prose. It's all about establishing setting, creating characters the reader wants to know better, engaging with uncertainties. No flowery gewgaws or cheap devices to be had here: just smart storytelling.I had reported in a status update that this reminded me quite a bit of To Kill a Mockingbird, though it's probably not fair to compare them; there's not too much overlap storywise. Rather, the feelings Lansdale tale left me with were not unlike those that of Harper Lee's beloved fictional (but very real for the day and time) account of racial injustice. Much like Ms. Lee's Jim Crow-era'd Alabama, The Bottoms has as its backdrop the racial divide in Depression Era East Texas. The story is capably recounted in flashback by octogenarian Harry Crane of his life in the Bottoms (a briar-y mucky morass along the Sabine River) of gruesome goings-on back when he and his younger sister Tomasina ('Tom') were kids. One day while exploring the neighboring Bottoms, Harry and Tom encounter a badly decomposed body of a 'colored' woman strung up with baling wire. This news, after reported to their father (constable Jacob Crane), was met with a collective shrug by most of the white populace ('oh, another N----- whore kilt, big deal' was the prevailing attitude). The black folks were naturally more fearful, yet sanguine, throwing around the \"Goat Man\" or \"Travelling Man\" (hobo) lore around to attribute the murder to. The kids (and naturally their constable father) just wanted justice for the killed woman. As a few more brutally murdered corpses start turning up around the Sabine, however, they realize that justice is not going be swift or blind. As allegations by Constable Jacob start flying, the Ku Klux Klan (and its supporters) start meting out justice of its own. As murder mysteries go, this one wasn't all that taut (even idjit me had this figured out by about the midway mark) but you'll probably overlook that in favor of the sweaty sordidness of the wretched tableaux Lansdale's painted for the reader. He puts you right there in the thick of it, bushwhacking through the brambles, sweating as the protagonists sift the Bottoms for the truth. I devoured this quickly, but I'm certain it will stay with me for quite a while. He's got many novels and short stories under his belt before and since this 2000 release; I can't wait to explore them all."}, {"userName": "Britany", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany", "userReview": "East Texas, 1930s, Racial tensions, add in a serial killer and the legend of the \"Goat Man\"...Harry is just a little boy growing up in Texas where racial tensions still run thick.

I did see a few similarities, as the father in the story Constable Jacob Collins is charged with trying to uphold the law at a time when aiding a black person could result in the KKK burning a cross in your yard, and it's told in a no nonsense form which is similar to some Faulkner's tales.

Lansdale is predominantly known as a horror writer, but lookie here: The Bottoms won the Edgar Award (Mystery) for best novel. Now, despite being a mystery, there weren't any big surprises for me, but where the novel truly shines is as the coming of age story of a 13 year-old boy in the early 1930s.I was surprised at what a quick read this was. For some reason I was under the impression that this was a denser read, but in no way was I disappointed at that. I'm a big fan of less is more. Lansdale writes in a very economical fashion, but I was totally drawn in to the sense of place and time in this story. The characters were well developed, and the description and feel of racial tensions are worthy of Harper Lee's classic.The only thing that could have been better was maybe being rocked orblindsided by a revelation at the end, and for this reason only, my rating will fall only a smidgen short of awesome. On second thought, as I write this review, images from the story are still flashing through my mind, and there are feelings that I think will continue to linger for a while yet. I love books that will do that to me. So, 5 stars it is. It's such a fast read, but it'll take a long while to shake the feeling of East Texas in the 1930s.

This one had been on my radar for the last couple years. I decided to grab a copy from my local library, and I'm glad I did. While not as perfect as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (Harper Lee), THE BOTTOMS is definitely in the same ballpark of great American literature. An amazing cast of characters are brought to life and tossed into this excellent tale of murder, mystery, and the evil that men do. Based down south back in the 1930's, a young boy, Harry, and his sister Tom, find a brutalized body barbwired to a tree down by the river. Their father, Jacob, the town constable, sets out to try and figure who could have done such a thing. Race plays a major role in the story adding depth and tension to an already poignant piece. More bodies turn up, and the town, led by a Klan loving bastard named Nation, is convinced the killer is black and set there eyes upon an old man living in a shack in the bottoms. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout. Harry's part in all of this makes for a great coming-of-age story, as well. We see plenty of what is so wrong with America (then and now), but Lansdale also reminds us that there is goodness, even in those we think are among the lost.My thoughts:A terrific novel, filled with intrigue and suspense, wonderful descriptive narratives, characters you won't soon forget, and that old life lesson\u2013never judge a book by its cover.I did know who the killer was fairly early on, but that did not take away from my enjoyment of the book.

The story is narrated by 11 year old Harry Collins from his rest home bed many years later. There are issues of race and the KKK play a role throughout. Life in The Bottoms, a deprived and poor area of East Texas, is described wonderfully by Lansdale, and though the subject matter is often dark his characters have humour and warmth. The strongest part of the novel is the last chapter, the climax, and there is a section following that lets the reader know what went in to happen to the cast - a welcomed feature that is almost read with a tear in the eye.

It is also a murder mystery, a story of a family trying to make ends meet in the small town of Marvel Creek, a morality tale of how to be in the horrific world of the Jim Crow south and a portrait of a very specific place and time in history. Most of Lansdale's writing is described as Southern Gothic and I only had a feeling of what that meant. So off to Wikipedia, which defines it as:Common themes in Southern Gothic literature include deeply flawed, disturbing or eccentric characters who may or may not dabble in hoodoo, ambivalent gender roles, decayed or derelict settings, grotesque situations, and other sinister events relating to or stemming from poverty, alienation, crime, or violence.I've only read this and Lansdale's Edge of Dark Water, but both fit this definition perfectly. Lansdale creates vivid descriptions of the look and smell of the East Texas landscape, builds suspense that keeps you turning pages, writes with wisdom and humor and pays homage to To Kill a Mockingbird and other classics of the genre. I loved the characters and their responses to the events of that year along the Sabine River. I burned through this book in just a few days, finding it hard to put down.

Lansdale in 2000. I was interested in reading it the n, but never quite got around to it. The book stayed on my 'to-read' list, and on my shelf, year after year. Now I've finally read it and I ask myself, \"What took me so long??\"This is quite simply one of the best suspense stories I have ever read. The suspense was real, the characters compelling, and the story moved right along so that before I knew it, the pages had flown by.The story is told as the reminiscence of an old man who as a boy lived in the deep woods of east Texas in the 1930s. The low-lying woods, with its river full of water moccasins and moss-laced trees, are known as 'the Bottoms'. It's a perfectly eerie place to set a murder mystery.The boy, Harry, and his little sister, Tom, find the mutilated body of a woman tied with barbed wire to a tree next to the river. Their father is the local constable, so Harry tries to taga long as his father looks for clues to the murderer's identity. The murdered woman was black, but her body was found in the predominantly white area. Racism is rampant in these parts, so there is a lot of racial tension. More grisly murders occur and the story gets more complicated.Who is committing the murders? The Goat Man, a devil creature believed to live in the woods? Mose, the black man who lives in a shack by the river? Red, the prejudiced white constable of the next town, a man who also has ties to Harry's father and mother? Or one of the Nation boys, known to torture small creatures? The suspects are many and the clues are few.I was really impressed with Lansdale's portrayal of his characters, especially Harry's father. Not being able to clear up the murders really takes its toll on him. Other characters show real emotion and empathy. This isn't a cozy story, and bad things do happen to good people.The suspense in this book is great. If anyone had tapped me on the shoulder while I was reading this I would have jumped out of my skin! From crossing the rickety 'swinging bridge' over the river, to running through brambles at night with an unknown person or creature following, the outcomes were filled with trepidation.Lansdale has written many other books, although this is the first I've read.

Agree to disagree."}], "description": "The narrator of The Bottoms is Harry Collins, an old man obsessively reflecting on certain key experiences of his childhood. In 1933, the year that forms the centerpiece of the narrative, Harry is 11 years old and living with his mother, father, and younger sister on a farm outside of Marvel Creek, Texas, near the Sabine River bottoms. Harry's world changes forever when he discovers the corpse of a young black woman tied to a tree in the forest near his home. The woman, who is eventually identified as a local prostitute, has been murdered, molested, and sexually mutilated. She is also, as Harry will soon discover, the first in a series of similar corpses, all of them the victims of a new, unprecedented sort of monster: a traveling serial killer.From his privileged position as the son of constable (and farmer and part-time barber) Jacob Collins, Harry watches as the distinctly amateur investigation unfolds. As more bodies -- not all of them \"colored\" -- surface, the mood of the local residents darkens. Racial tensions -- never far from the surface, even in the best of times -- gradually kindle. When circumstantial evidence implicates an ancient, innocent black man named Mose, the Ku Klux Klan mobilizes, initiating a chilling, graphically described lynching that will occupy a permanent place in Harry Collins's memories. With Mose dead and the threat to local white women presumably put to rest, the residents of Marvel Creek resume their normal lives, only to find that the actual killer remains at large and continues to threaten the safety and stability of the town.Lansdale uses this protracted murder investigation to open up a window on an insular, poverty-stricken, racially divided community. With humor, precision, and great narrative economy, he evokes the society of Marvel Creek in all its alternating tawdriness and nobility, offering us a varied, absolutely convincing portrait of a world that has receded into history. At the same time, he offers us a richly detailed re-creation of the vibrant, dangerous physical landscapes that were part of that world and have since been buried under the concrete and cement of the industrialized juggernaut of the late 20th century. In Lansdale's hands, the gritty realities of Depression-era Texas are as authentic -- and memorable -- as anything in recent American fiction.", "title": "The Bottoms", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102113.The_Bottoms", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348765461l/102113.jpg", "reviews": 654, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58971.Joe_R_Lansdale", "name": "Joe R.
