Very easy to read and absorbing. The kids are adorable and funny! Actually, quite like the time skip, which is surprising, since I usually don't.

I find it fascinating that in focusing on small group of people who are really trying to just survive and help one another Foner is able to continually utilize and develop engaging characters that the reader just enjoys. I think the reason I enjoy his books because the underlying mystery behind them is that of how the universe works, which is a concept anyone can connect with. The characters are humans who are trying to make their way (and find their place) amongst a galactic ecosystem that has been going on for thousands (or hundreds of thousands!) of years.If you've never read any of the EarthCent stories, start with the first book (Date Night on Union Station). But if you have enjoyed any of them, this is another fun continuation of the ongoing saga of the zany but likeable family of characters."}, {"userName": "Dave Weiss", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4103478-dave-weiss", "userReview": "Read this one while on a weekend trip. It is yet another great book in this series. I've read six of them this year, and will continue for sure. They are just fun books\u2014slices of life in a sci-fi world. They are clean, not-at-all violent and just interesting as all get out. Foner does such a great with characterization that you really care what happens with these people and wonder what they will experience next."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7172504-chelsea", "userReview": "Fun, lighthearted series This series doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, and I love that!

More TroubleThis series continues to be a blast. Ambassador Kelly starts a quiz show to promote understanding between alien species and to help human relationships between them all. This does not work out as expected after the show's producers make a few changes. Also a multi-alien group shows up called the Wanderers and basically extorts repairs and money from the various alien governments, threatening to visit their home planets if aid isn't extended. There is also a look into the mind of Beowulf, the reincarnated Huravian Dog, who is becoming quite a character in this series. In fact a lot of new background information is presented concerning the Makers, Styrx and others. Start with the first book and read in order. You might as well get them all, they are original and worth it."}, {"userName": "Jacque Holst", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7878238-jacque-holst", "userReview": "The family is growingThe third generation of humans are being born on Union Station. They're still the new kids on the block so to speak, but they're making friends and a place for themselves. Technically they may never catch up with the other aliens, but their naivete and honesty amuses the others who feel deception is better than war and 'fixing' anything from votes to contests is perfectly honorable. Besides the Stryx never let things go to far. Also in this book we find out why the Makers made the Stryx."}, {"userName": "Kathy Bryson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21755785-kathy-bryson", "userReview": "This entire series is brilliant, but this installment takes the madcap madness to a whole new level! A vagabond troupe of freeloading hedonists descend on the station, striking terror in the hearts of the experienced diplomats. The children of Union Station are the ones who learn what living like a bum entails, a challenge for them as they grew up under Styx tutelage and mastered not only barter, but empire-building in their childhoods! Ambassador Kelly might have been worried except the kids can handle themselves and she's got her own problems with a fledgling career in game shows!"}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34732365-rob", "userReview": "Wandering why/ Wanderers was a nice little tale to fit in a lot of background information on the A.I. Stroud from their maker ,who is being interviewed by Kelly ,the Earth ambassador. The wanderers bring a little newness to the station, with some new characters added. There is a new little girl character that needs some help and her storyline starts in this tale that I would like to see additions too.
