Now: Cass is stuck in a basement with her middle school arch-enemy, Heather, while they work on sets and costumes for \"Super Sweet Ninja Death Squad,\" the musical Julia had barely finished just before her death. Has Heather changed? Has Cass?  This was a subtle, melancholy, poignant story about loss and love, just as the title promises. The theater plot was fun and added some much-needed occasional humor to the sadder bits.

But as far as I know, this is Horner's only book, and not gonna lie, my expectations were not super high. But I think I would've liked this book a lot even if they'd been higher. Now I'm mad at myself for not reading this earlier, because it's something I could've been recommending for years while f/f YA fleshed itself out - a book with road trip and theater elements, plus a best friend/romance confusion element, and an enemies-to-lovers romance, all in an alternating timeline story? There was a lot for me to enjoy here, and I hope Horner ends up writing more someday."}, {"userName": "Raina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1640308-raina", "userReview": "It took me a minute to warm up to this book. It seemed a little TOO custom-written for me. And I like to defy expectations.But I read the last half in less than 24 hours. The story flips between Then and Now. Then is a selection of memories of her friend, as well as of her cross-country bicycle trip to honor her friend. Now focuses on the production of Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad, the musical written by her friend, and her romance with another member of the team putting it on.There are too many great quotes in this book. About figuring out who you are, about questioning your sexuality (SO many extra stars for not portraying sexuality as a binary), about mourning the loss of your closest friend. I really appreciate the way Horner acknowledges the importance of friendship. It's definitely a story which resonated with me, all the way down to the Quaker appearances. It's kinda hard to talk about, actually."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1676535-lauren", "userReview": "Don't you just hate it when a book you've been pining over for the last year or so ends up disappointing it you? Well, I do, and sadly enough that is what happened with A Love Story Starring My Dead Best Friend and me. I've been looking forward to this book since it was titled Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad, a title I loved and still do, and after hearing the most amazing things about this, I was even more excited. So when the time came to read this, I couldn't wait to gobble it right up. The beginning of this was great. I loved the premise, which had to do with Cass and her friends putting on their dead best friend's supper secret play. I loved the fact that it was altering between section titled \"Now\" and \"Then\" because you got to see what occurred before the accident and of Cass's bike trip, as well as current time. And, lastly, I loved the friendship between Cass and Julia, which was sweet and relatable, as well as the budding romance between Heather and Cass. The middle, however, left a lot to be desired. Since missing was the funniness and uniqueness I loved, instead it was switched with boringness that I detested. Suddenly, I was not at all awed by Cass, nor could I find her particular likable. She was just there and, I have to say, I found her to be a bit annoying. Plus there wasn't nearly as much info about her and Julia's friendship; the plot dragged in a pace that made this novel unbearable at times; and character development was lacking. Though I did like some parts of this, such as Heather, my favorite character, and the messages that came with Cass's journey to find out who she was without Julia. Then something particularly AMAZING happened. What was that per say? Well, the last four chapters. All of sudden my faith in this was restored. I was smiling giddily, laughing, and going \"Aw!\" at was happening, as well as beginning to understand Cass in a way I couldn't before. If based on those and the beginning alone, I would have loved A Love Story Starring My Dead Best Friend, strangely enough. Though I can't, so overall it was okay, not great, not amazing, not spectacular, just okay. I can see promise in Horner, even if it wasn't displayed as well as I would've liked in this novel. So even with the disappointment this brought, I still will be reading more by her, possibly. Grade: Very, very, very low C. A D+ most likely."}, {"userName": "Elise (TheBookishActress)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elise-thebookishactress", "userReview": "I'm going to read this... someday...

She's gone off like this, by herself, because Julia's boyfriend has cast her middle school nemesis, Heather, as the star in the musical Julia wrote before her death. When she gets back from her trip, Cass starts helping produce the musical, and gets to know Heather much better.I just loved this book. Cass and her friends are all engaging characters to me, especially Julia. How can you not love a girl who writes a musical called Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad? How can you not love a group of friends who put their summer on hold to put that play on for her? The romance between Cass and Heather was built very subtly and naturally, and I enjoyed seeing things develop between them. The one major word of complaint that I have is that the book alternates between chapters set during Cass's bike trip (Then) and chapters set during the production of the musical (Now). It can be a little jarring, and I don't think it was necessary. I think we would have seen a much more satisfactory character arc, for Cass, that way. I suspect that it's because an awful lot of Then is spent with a solitary Cass thinking to herself, and that might have weighed down the first half of the book.But I really loved this book anyways. I also liked that Cass and her family are practicing Quakers, a religion I haven't seen much at all in YA. I didn't think it was particularly preachy, either, which is also nice."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2675749-amanda", "userReview": "This is one of those books that I wish had come out a decade ago, because I could really have used it back then. I saw a lot myself and the people I knew in high school in this book, and I suspect it will resonate with a number of teenagers I know today. Don't get scared off by the beginning, which is sort of weird and irritating - the rest of the book is great.Cass's best friend Julia dies in a car accident, and A Love Story Starring My Dead Best Friend follows Cass and her friends as they attempt to pick up the pieces, move on, and memorialize Julia as best they can. Cass memorializes her dead best friend in two ways: she takes the trip out west that she and Julia had planned, and she participates in the production of the musical Julia had been working on before her death. The road trip takes place during summer break, and the play is staged early on in the school year. The novel skips back and forth between the two stories, which normally bothers me, but here, the stories just work better this way.The great thing is that both stories are equally engaging. I love road trip novels, and I really love Route 66, so I enjoyed the chapters about Cass's struggle to bike from Chicago to Los Angeles. Watching Cass return to the \"real world\" and attempt to navigate her changed relationships with Julia's friends - and enemies - is equally compelling. Horner's portrayal of this gang of grieving teenagers rings true for me - I know plenty of kids, especially theatre kids, who watch a lot of obscure horror movies and would do anything for their friends.I never got any real sense of what Julia was like - for all that the novel happens because of her death, we don't know very much about her life. She liked theatre, was really into her boyfriend, was great at writing music...that's about all we know. And that's okay. This book is so not about Julia, and I like that. Instead, we get a smart, sympathetic portrait of smart, sympathetic Cass as she works through her grief by making mistakes, getting in trouble, and maybe even falling in love."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372701-sarah", "userReview": "Let me tell you what I liked about this book:1. I suppose technically it's a coming out story but I didn't feel a whole lot of OMG MY LIFE IS OVER B/C I'M GAY meme2. The main character has multiple complicated imperfect romantic plotlines going on. It's not just \"I saw her and, reader, suddenly my whole world shifted and that's when I knew I was gay. I came out to my family and friends and hoo boy was that dramatic but nothing could stop the trueness of our love! There's no one else for me but her!\" No.3. Cass's relationship with Julia, her best friend, is deep and complicated. They're not just acquaintances who do things together in the way that a lot of friendships are portrayed. They actually have a friendship that has problems and develops and changes without being over. Also all kinds of interesting questions are raised about the blurring of lines between friendship and attraction and commitment.4. ROAD TRIP!5. \"Evil\" person seeks redemption! People are not solely evil or solely good! Bad people do good! Good people do bad! Everyone is complicated! Hooray non-essentialism!6. It came \"highly recommended\" by my penguin rep.Things I didn't like:1. Um, Cass goes to a school without any people of color apparently?2. She bikes from Chicago to Oklahoma and doesn't have a single scary encounter with some skeezey person? I'm sorry I just find that really hard to believe. Especially when she makes friend with a random guy in a band and then gets picked up by a girl in a pickup truck (who just happens to be gay, in the wilds of Missouri).3. Too many flat characters. Too many drama friends. I couldn't tell them apart.4. Occasionally the back-and-forthness of the narrative was a little confusing.5. Sometimes there was just a little bit too much of my life in this book.But overall, really awesome!"}, {"userName": "Anita Pogorzelska", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54133132-anita-pogorzelska", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

Funny, touching, and relatable - this is one of the best YA debuts I've seen in a while. I'll mention the couple of (minor) problems I had: the letter at the beginning was cheesy and almost had me putting the book down; I'm not a huge fan of books that skip back and forth in time because it is extraordinarily difficult to do well enough that it actually benefits the story; the cross-country road trip was unrealistically free of skeevy/scary experiences (I can't even travel across town without some of those, let alone hundreds of miles!); and the ending was maybe a little too tied up with a bow perfect. On the other hand, though, Cass was a fantastic character: complex, introverted, still figuring herself out but basically relatable and likable. Musicals may be one of the new big things in YA lit, but Ninja Death Squad was fun and meaningful and I totally want to see it. Friendship and love and sexuality are all presented as a big tangled up mess that can be confusing and scary and wonderful all at the same time, which is pretty much true for everyone in high school. I liked how Heather didn't fit into the mean girl role neatly, because she was actually a person, not just attributes, and there were reasons for her actions even when the reasons and the actions weren't commendable. In other words, I liked how this book gives teens credit for being able to see and appreciate nuances in feelings and behaviors and people. Life isn't straightforward, even if YA books frequently write it that way. And, of course, I always appreciate it when authours write great queer books for kids - especially for all those queer girls in high school. Right now, the gayboy YA outnumbers the girls by around 3 to 1, and I'm constantly having to give \"but\" recommendations. You know, \"This is a great book, but it's a little dated.\" Or \"This is a sweet story, but the writings not all that great.\" Or \"I really like this book, but none of the characters actually identify as queer.\" Or \"This book is about a queer girl, but she goes crazy/has a shitty life/tries to kill herself/is abused/etc.\" So I am so excited to see books coming out (ha!) that I can recommend without any caveats.

There's a lot that I wanted to say and I wish I had written my thoughts down when I was reading it, but I didn't. I'll do my best, though. First, I want to say that this is not a perfectly polished, perfectly written book (I will not add \"for a teen novel\" or \"for a YA novel\" because there are a lot of extremely sophisticated, beautifully written books for teenagers out there and I, myself, hope to complete and publish one someday; in other words, I'm neither a lit snob nor a pretentious douche-bag that can't deign to read a book for young people without being self-deprecating about it). There were pieces of dialogue that went on without attributing them to anyone (just a \"she said\" would have sufficed for me) and I got confused by them at times. But aside from small details such as this, I found myself completely in love with this book, which is the author's first (i.e., it's allowed a few flaws). There are flashes of true, heartfelt insight in these pages. I couldn't help but be enchanted by the descriptions of the open road (the lead character, Cass takes her dead best friend's ashes on an ambitious road trip from Illinois to California...by way of bicycle!) and by the characters (Cass's friends reminded me of people I knew: quirky and funny, nerdy and ninja-loving theater kids). The book is also a bit of a coming-out story - Cass discovers that she likes girls, that maybe she was even a little in love with her friend, Julia (whose death in a traffic accident is what compels Cass to take to the road) and that, despite their history as bully and bullied, she may be falling for a girl named Heather, who is cast in the musical that Julia wrote before she died. It's a lovely book and I applaud Emily Horner on a wonderful debut novel."}, {"userName": "Jill Guccini", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180500-jill-guccini", "userReview": "Really want to give this one a 4.5. I felt genuinely moved at the end of this, which made me realize I hadn't felt genuinely moved by a book in quite a while. And by moved, I mean it Made Me Feel A Lot Of Things.

So.I was obviously more drawn to the trying-to-bike-across-the-country-with-your-best-friend-who-you-were-secretly-in-love-with's-ashes storyline, because who wouldn't be drawn to that storyline. But the Ninja Deathsquad storyline was helpful in having some more light-hearted moments, which are always necessary but not always as prevalent as they should be in YA. Because I mean, teens are brilliant and creative and funny, which Horner is able to capture. If anything I felt like maybe some of the emotions so wonderfully described by Horner were actually too complex and mature for these kids. I mean, this is one mature protagonist. But I feel like that's always a tricky thing to navigate with evaluating YA, because who the hell are we to say what's too complex and mature for teens when teens are all so different?Anyway.

It was unwarranted. Horner's first novel is ably plotted and well-done. There were more than a few laugh-out-loud moments, and I liked the narrator very well. She was achingly believable and so adolescently stupid she could have stepped right off the page. I loved the long-distance bicycle trip. I loved the growth in the characters throughout the story. I loved the way the friends close ranks when it becomes important. There's a lot here to love.For all that I loved it, I recognize that it's a first novel.

The two parts don't have a large gap of time between them, but are just set apart by a couple of months (keep in mind, Cass's road trip takes place during summer break -July to early August-, as well as her work on the play -Mid-August to September-). For some, this alternating switch of time-periods between each chapter might be irritating. But personally, I found it to be alright, as it just takes of matter of time to adapt to this style of storytelling (or the ability to have a open-mindedness about reading in said way).Readers get to follow Cass and her process of slowly growing up and learning to cope with the issues in her life. Her pride, bitterness, self-pity, and her tendency to not take responsibility and blame everyone for her problems is evident throughout the novel, but as the two parts of the story are told and begin to coherently come together, we can also see Cass changing as well.Cass's journey through the summer break (mostly when she was rescued from almost not being able to finish her quest) has also made Cass finally face what she'd been trying so hard not to think about; what her relationship with Julia really meant to her. Her successful journey also helped Cass face Heather and eventually to give her a second chance.Though I wasn't surprised during events such as when Cass's bike was stolen (which, I thought was very likely to happen), I WAS unexpectedly taken aback when Cass did manage to reach California (with her friends in tow -or, rather, Cass in tow-). I wasn't expecting her journey to actually be fulfilled; I thought that when her bike was stolen, it would be the end of her escapade, and she would have to swallow her pride and return home not being able to finish what she started. It was nice for all her friends (not just Ollie) to cram into his car and be a part of Cass's road trip to California (though, obviously it would make sense for ALL of them to take part in this for Julia).I've been mostly talking about only one part of the novel; Cass's road trip. But there is the other part of the novel, as equally as important to the plot and growth of Cass's character (which I won't go into detail about)! :)"}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2279830-kristin", "userReview": "I was very skeptical about this book before I read it. This year I have read 3 books that included some sort of performance art to mark the climax of the story; and while they all served their purpose, the chosen event seems exhausted. I felt a little uneasy knowing that the original musical, Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad was the main event of this book. But, it turned out not to be, but actually so so much more. I was only going to give A Love Story 4 stars because sometimes the dialogue felt clunky and too mature for 17 year olds; man, they are complicated! I was also unsure about the alternating \"Now\" and \"Then\" chapters. Cass, the narrator, is preparing for the early school year performance of Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad during the \"Now'; and recounting a doomed bicycle journey to honor her best friend, Julia, during the \"Then\". But, it is clear they are complementary parts creating a bittersweet whole. So, 5 stars it is.As for the actual story: Cass may or may not have been in love with Julia since their friendship began in grade school. Julia died in a car accident right before their senior year of high school, but she left behind the script for the original muiscal, Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad and her friends decide that they must put it on. Ollie, Julia's boyfriend, resents Cass and whatever feelings she may have had for Julia. Heather was Cass's mortal enemy in middle school and shows up after transferring to Catholic school and back right before senior year because she was cast as Ninja Princess Himiko/needed to get away from the nuns and her ex. Put these characters together in a high school and prepare for something volatile. And, sprinkle a thoughtfully crafted romance to soothe the tempest within (or not!). Aside from designing artillery for the play, Cass is a bicycle enthusiast, a math geek, Quaker and a lesbian with pretty supportive parents who are big on \"hippie Jesus\" - turn the other cheek, love your enemies. But, this is by far NOT the Gaytopia of David Levithan's books. There is plenty of homophobia to make it feel authentic (without being didactic) and remind us that yes, people are still judgmental and kids are still scared to come out even with plenty of gay role models, community support, films, etc. That's what makes this book so important. But, bravery and courage prevail, always. I look forward to more novels by Emily Horner.

It's about one girls quest to confront her grief and discover herself. It is a funny, touching, coming-of-age debut and while I wouldn't go so far as to say Cass is highly likeable, I do think teenagers will be able to relate to at least one of her struggles (including her alternative parents). The main themes are friendship, grief, relationships, self esteem, sexuality, growing up and... musicals!Although Cass is a smart girl, she hasn't quite figured out who she is or her place in the world and after the death of Julia, while she tells herself the road trip is to honour Julia, it's more about being independent, proving herself to those back home and herself and it also allows her to get away from some of Julia's friends who are striking out at her and each other amidst their grief. It also gives her the chance to get away, think clearly and discover who she is as a person and also what Julia really meant to her.The story is a little slow and confusing at the beginning, mostly due to the fact that it goes back and forth in time, from 'Then' when Julia was alive and the subsequent road trip and 'Now' after Cass has returned and is working on the musical penned by Julia, 'Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad'. I'm not a big fan of books that go back and forth in time but I quickly got over my initial confusion as I think Emily Horner has done a really good job of keeping the story together and all events relevant.There are two little paragraphs that have really stuck with me since finishing this book. Neither of them have anything to do with each other (they both just happen to occur at 3am).The first is this, for no reason other than it made me laugh.'Okay. Obviously you have not lived.''I was once kissed in a motel hallway by a bass player, at three in the morning,''Impressive, but unconvincing.'The second is part of an entire chapter which I love but if I write down the whole chapter, aside from being ridiculously long, it will spoil some of the story. I will say that this chapter, to me, represents the true meaning of friendship.'Thank you,' I said. Like that would cover it. Like it would come anywhere close to covering it.

The topic of teenagers dealing with grief while still trying to be like teenagers is handled very well in the novel. Unfortunately, none of the characters are at all likable. The characters in the novel all seem to be pseudo-ironic faux-hipsters, who love ninjas, breaking into song, and complaining about how American horror movies are vastly inferior to the Korean originals. The only way the characters in the novel could have been more like cliched wannabe hipsters would have been if the novel were set in a Brooklyn dumpster and they had been drinking PBR instead of Merlot. Also, there's a good bit of generally snotty teenage behaviour, but that's to be expected in a novel about teens. The premise of the novel is grand. The grief of young people is handled very well. Unfortunately, the characters are like an unholy union of Glee fans and people who take pictures from 4chan and post them to other sites on the Internets, that is to say, people who desperately want others to think they are \"cool,\" \"with it,\" and \"hip to the scene,\" etc. For young people, I think this would be a great book.

Unfortunately, the story fell flat for me and I was left feeling disappointed.Cass was a likable enough lead, but she just wasn\u2019t distinctive enough to make a lasting impression on me. She could be very selfish at times, and had a real problem facing up to her issues. A lot of the story talked about how much Cass felt excluded when her best friend Julia made new friends, but in reality, if Cass had actually made any effort, she would have been readily accepted into the new group.Speaking of the supporting characters, they were another issue for me. They suffered from a lack of development to the point where they all more or less blurred into one for me. They were also very stereotypical, don\u2019t break the mold types of characters and I felt it was a real shame that the author didn\u2019t take the time to flesh them out more, as strong supporting characters can often lift a book from being average, to being great.The time jumps in the book were quite jerky and sometimes took away from the flow of the story. It could have been improved if the jumps to the \u2018Then\u2019 chapters actually related to what was going on in the \u2018Now\u2019 chapters, but to me, it just felt too much like two completely different stories.Overall, the book was a sometimes fun, but mostly disappointing read. If the author had spent more time developing stronger characters, I think the outcome could have been quite different."}, {"userName": "Shawn Towner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3058265-shawn-towner", "userReview": "I feel dirty reading young adult fiction, but this book was listed in the Editor's Choice of the NYT book review, so I can use that to rationalize my intellectual downfall. The book is about an unpopular girl who is trying to honour her dead best friend's memory by putting on a play that she (the dead friend) wrote. That part of the novel I'm fine with. The topic of teenagers dealing with grief while still trying to be like teenagers is handled very well in the novel. Unfortunately, none of the characters are at all likable. The characters in the novel all seem to be pseudo-ironic faux-hipsters, who love ninjas, breaking into song, and complaining about how American horror movies are vastly inferior to the Korean originals. The only way the characters in the novel could have been more like cliched wannabe hipsters would have been if the novel were set in a Brooklyn dumpster and they had been drinking PBR instead of Merlot. Also, there's a good bit of generally snotty teenage behaviour, but that's to be expected in a novel about teens. The premise of the novel is grand. The grief of young people is handled very well. Unfortunately, the characters are like an unholy union of Glee fans and people who take pictures from 4chan and post them to other sites on the Internets, that is to say, people who desperately want others to think they are \"cool,\" \"with it,\" and \"hip to the scene,\" etc. For young people, I think this would be a great book. For jaded early-middle-aged shut-ins like myself, it's just a frustrating disappointment."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2715454-kate", "userReview": "There are moments where you're reading a book, and the narrative describes your thoughts about yourself so perfectly that the floor comes out from under you, and you say \"Whoa.\" That happened twice while reading this book. A friend of mine recommended it on Facebook, so I thought I'd give it a whirl, and the book will stick with me forever because I was this girl. I still am this girl, in certain ways. Not quite as into anime/ninja stuff, not quite as awkward, but still. The line \"There is a person somewhere in the world who actually considers me kissable!\" is one that I still wonder about as far as myself, and I've often stood in front of the mirror having the exact same thoughts as Cassandra. \"But, I kept staring, as if to answer the question: What had she seen in me that I hadn't seen?\" I've lived that moment. I still live that moment.The story also touched on the aching loss of a friend at such a young age, where everyone's supposed to be invincible, where you don't have to worry about moving past crippling loss. Where your own identity is a terrifying thing, and where a belief in God is reconciled with a belief in the self. Cassie learned that you have to move on from the past, whether it's good or bad. She had to leave behind the greatest friend in her life, and she had to leave behind the idea of her bully, or else she wouldn't have discovered herself, and what it is to love in the wake of death."}, {"userName": "Bunker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1828000-bunker", "userReview": "Horner weaves a tale of loyalty, love, and loss in this novel featuring Cass, who has recently endured the death of her best friend, Julia. Julia, who perished in a late night car accident in the rain, had long been the object of Cass's love, even though Cass does not realize her feelings until it is too late. While Julia's boyfriend, Oliver, and the rest of her drama friends band together to bring Julia's secret project- \"Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad\"- to the stage, Cass decides to honor Julia's memory by embarking on the cross-country trip they had planned to California with a credit card for emergencies, a tent, protein bars, her bicycle, and Julia's ashes. The catalysts to her journey are the palpable jealousy between Cass and Oliver over who loved Julia more and the naming of Heather, Cass's middle school homophobic nemesis, as the lead in Julia's musical. Along the way, both on her road trip and as she works on the play afterward, Cass encounters places and truths that were always over the horizon and in her mind's periphery, and she learns the valuable lesson that age can bring transformation.The alternating chapters between past and present slow down the plot, but the tender portrayal of Cass's development keeps this book afloat."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267866-audrey", "userReview": "Cass is having a rough time. Her best (and possibly only) friend, Julia, was killed in a car accident. Now Julia's friends are putting on a musical that Julia wrote before her death. The problem: the female lead, Heather, is the same girl that terrorized Cass three years earlier by calling her a lesbian in front of the whole school. The story switches between Cass's journey by bicycle to take Julia's ashes to the Pacific, and her struggle to figure out her new relationship with Heather, all while trying to come to terms with what her sexual orientation may or may not be.I liked the idea of this book. Using a journey to discover the self, and then making amends with the past sounds like a great concept. However, I never really got into the story or the characters. Julia never seemed like much of a real person to me, and I couldn't relate to Cass. I also couldn't wrap my head around doing a \"Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad\" musical, probably because that is so far off of the radar of what I'd be into. I'm sure this is probably a good book for somebody, maybe a teen trying to come to terms with who he or she is, but it just wasn't for me."}, {"userName": "Daphne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37016646-daphne", "userReview": "I read the first fifth of this book yesterday, then sat down to read again today and read rest of it in one sitting. This book was really, really good. A Love Story Starring My Dead Best Friend Has a very interesting structure. There are two storylines going on at the same time, both with the same main character. One takes place in the recent past, right after the main character's best friend died. The other is a little while later in the present. The chapters alternate between \"Then\" and \"Now\". At first, I thought this was a recipe for disaster, how could I keep two storylines straight when they're both about the same person without getting confused? But it wasn't nearly as hard to keep track of as I feared. The stories were different enough to be easy to keep apart and they also complimented each other nicely.I thought the romance was really nice too. It showed how relationships can change over time in a very realistic way, and the issues the two girls ran into felt very natural. The ending was just really cute."}, {"userName": "Sara ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5935486-sara", "userReview": "ANOTHER story about a teen dealing with the death of a friend? But I've already read Please Ignore Vera Dietz and Catch & Release and not to mention (not quite in the same category) If I Stay.But as the cover tells you, this is more of a love story than an angsty downer. At first I wasn't so taken with the narrative style which seemed all over the place. But I kept going and the story won me over. The book is not a cliche. In any way, other than with its \"Will the School Musical Come Together On Time?\" subplot. Instead this is a sweet story about friendship, dating, first love, forgiveness and growing up. It's a short read, but a good one."}, {"userName": "Allison Floyd", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805686-allison-floyd", "userReview": "GUPTGed! Disclaimer: if I hadn't already read Looking for Alaska, I might have had more patience with this book. As it stands, I have read Looking for Alaska, and Bridge to Terabithia, and plenty of other formulaic YA books that have made me realize that death is, like, heavy, dude, and it changes things, and it could happen to you, even if you're young. I get it, YA authors! To be fair, I'm way outside the target age range, but I find that with the best of YA books, this doesn't seem to be an issue. Also, I only stuck it out until page 32, but, hell, I already know I don't like it, and in keeping with the whole mortality theme, life is short, man. I also found the voice to be a little too self-consciously--quirky/nerdy/indie/something, with dialogue that reads like Dialogue. Additionally, it is my firmly held belief that ninjas are the new \"think outside the box\". That is to say, tired and unoriginal.
