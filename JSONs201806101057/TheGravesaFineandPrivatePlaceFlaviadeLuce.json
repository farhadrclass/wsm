On the one hand, Flavia is growing up and maturing. It's wonderful to see the person she is becoming emerge. On the other hand, Flavia is changing and that's always a bit sad. Childhood is ending. I am enjoying how the relationships between the sisters is being exposed in the last couple of books. Also, Flavia's relationship with Dogger is more focused on and it's a delight to see. The mystery is, like always, interesting and fun. Another fun time with Flavia. I loved the chemistry experiments that were rigged up to help solve this case. I look forward to more books in future. Flavia's future is very much at a crossroads. With her interests and abilities, she can go anywhere she wants to."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "This is the ninth addition to the 'Flavia de Luce' series, set in 1950s England. You could read the book as a standalone, but for maximum enjoyment (and minimum spoilers) the series is best read in order. Flavia de Luce is a supremely self-confident twelve-year-old girl who's deeply interested in two things: chemistry and detective work. In her young life Flavia has frequently used her scientific expertise - and native smarts - to solve murders. *****As the book opens, Flavia is on holiday with her two older sisters, Ophelia (Feely) and Daphne (Daffy), and the family manservant Dogger - who's been with the de Luce clan for years. The little group is punting down a river near the village of Volesthorpe when Flavia, trailing her hand in the water, closes her fingers over what she thinks is a fish. Delighted, Flavia pulls up the catch.....only to discover it's the corpse of a young man. The cadaver is deposited on the shore, and - while the authorities are being summoned - Flavia takes the opportunity to carefully examine the body. She also takes a mysterious scrap of paper from one of the pockets. This is standard operating procedure for Ophelia, who's always hiding evidence from the police so she can solve cases first. The dead man is identified as Orlando Whitbread, an up-and-coming actor with the local 'Puddle Lane Little Theater.' Orlando is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Poppy Mandrill, a once famous actress who - after losing a leg - became a director. The dead man is best known, however, for being the son of Canon George Whitbread of Volesthorpe's 'St. Mildred's-in-the-Marsh Church.' The Canon was hanged a few years before for poisoning three female parishioners at Holy Communion. The town's police officer, Constable J.R. Otter, quickly calls Orlando's death a drowning.....and orders Flavia to stop her nosy probing. This only heightens Flavia's suspicions, since she's SURE Orlando was poisoned. Thus, Flavia continues to vigorously pursue her inquiries, with Dogger's invaluable help. Moreover, the amateur sleuth decides to re-investigate the case of Canon Whitbread....who she thinks might have been innocent. As Flavia flits around Volesthorpe she meets the undertaker's son, Hob Nightingale - who provides valuable information, a helping hand, and a smidge of friendship that Flavia badly needs.In previous books, Flavia has always been at odds with her sisters, and once even doused Feely's lipstick with poison ivy. However, the girls are more mature now, and on better terms. Thus, Flavia's inquiries are greatly assisted by Daffy's extensive knowledge of literature and poetry. As for Feely, she's still vain and self-absorbed, but she plays the organ beautifully at St. Mildred's-in-the-Marsh Church. In addition, Feely's fianc\u00e9 plays an important part in the story. In the course of the tale, Flavia makes important discoveries that put her in grave danger, but she eventually discovers the truth about everything. I enjoyed the book, which has the usual mix of interesting characters, fun science, and a creative mystery. One chapter, though - where Flavia has a 'psychic vision' of the female parishioners being poisoned - is not credible and should have been left out (IMO).I'd recommend the book to mystery lovers, especially fans of Flavia de Luce.

I'm a huge fan of Flavia and this, the 9th in the series, was terrific. I love how smart and precocious she is - her snark and wit, and how she employs her love and knowledge of chemistry to solve the crime. Flavia has had some hard knocks in the last few books and it was nice to see the relationship between Dogger and Flavia develop in this book. The book's ending is the perfect set-up for where the author will take the series, and makes me excited for the next book."}, {"userName": "Julie  Durnell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4566472-julie-durnell", "userReview": "3.5 Stars. This turned out to be not my favorite Flavia mystery. She seems to be borderline ghoul at times! Don't get me wrong I still love her-she is changing though or maturing maybe. Her knowledge of chemistry and other esoteric information is incredible, a child prodigy in essence. Flavia has a lot of discernment, which coupled with Dogger's, they are a fantastic detective duo. Dogger really shines in this story, his vast knowledge is also incredible. Her relationship with her sisters is mellowing out a bit which is part of the maturing I'm sure.

In a word, delightful!A couple of my favorite quotes from this series...\"Anyone who knew the word slattern was worth cultivating as a friend.\"\"Tell them we may not be praying with them,\" Father told the Vicar, \"but we are at least not actively praying against them.\"\"It is not unknown for fathers with a brace of daughters to reel off their names in order of birth when summoning the youngest, and I had long ago become accustomed to being called 'Ophelia Daphne Flavia, damn it.'\"She consumed books like a whale eats krill.\"\"You never know what you're getting into when you stick your nose in other people's rubbish.\"Start this fabulous series with the brilliant and Edgar Award winning,\"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie.\" I just finished \"The Grave's a Fine and Private Place\" and thought it was a dazzling 5 star book.

But it's the familiar (but not formulaic) style and well-loved characters that make me want to return again and again to the world of Flavia de Luce.I assume the 9th book is not going to be the first book someone picks up, but if in case you're new to the series, start with The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie and enjoy the adventure from the start. A spoiler from the end of the last book is coming:I wasn't sure what to expect from this book given that Flavia's father died at the end of the previous book. What would happen to the three sisters? How would Flavia handle the loss?The answer turned out to be a long family vacation led by Dogger, especially meant to keep Feely occupied while she waits for her postponed wedding, and a lot of British stiff-upper-lip.As usual, Flavia quickly finds a dead body, and discovers more than one mystery in the town they're visiting. With Flavia's father gone, we get a chance to see just how much paternal and sleuthing influence Dogger has on Flavia.Reading these books feels like getting to visit a dear friend you haven't seen in a year, you want to spend time with them for who they've already proven to be, and you want to spend time with them to see who they've become while you were apart. This book ended with a hint at what could be a truly marvelous setup for the final book of the series. If Flavia's suggestion comes to pass, then readers will easily be able to imagine the fulfilled life that Flavia and Dogger will get to carry out long after the last page.Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for allowing me to read an early copy of this book!"}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "First Sentence: I am on my deathbed.Flavia de Luce, her two sisters and Dogger, their loyal family servant, go on holiday to the hamlet of Volesthorpe. Drifting in a boat on the river, hand in the water, Flavia becomes snagged on what she imagines is Hemingway\u2019s great marlin from \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea.\u201d Even more to Flavia\u2019s style, is the discovery that her hand caught in the mouth of a corpse. The dead man was the son of the local church\u2019s Canon, who was hanged for poisoning three of his parishioners; the church ladies. But was the Canon really guilty? And who killed his son? What better than a murder investigation to take Flavia\u2019s mind off her troubles?The first thing one should remember about Flavia is that she is 14 years\u2019 old, brilliant and highly dramatic. She is also wonderfully written by Bradley who has created the perfect voice for her, and the perfect opening. As with most series, one does best to read the books in order. However, Bradley ensured first-time readers are fully introduced to the characters, their roles, and are brought quickly up to date.Some may find Flavia\u2019s viewpoint a bit uncomfortable\u2014\u201cMost people probably never stop to think about why our burial places are so green. But if they ever did, their faces might turn the very shade of that graveyard grass\u2026 For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,\u201d the Bible tells us. \u201cAshes to ashes, dust to dust,\u201d says The Book of Common Prayer. But both of these books, having been written mostly in good taste, fail to mention either the stinking jelly or the oozing liquids and the gaseous phases through which each of us must pass on our way to the Great Beyond.\u201d Yet for others of us, it is that perspective which makes her unique and delightful, and the way in which Flavia comes across the first body is very bit Flavia.Bradley\u2019s use of humor shows through in most situation, including his metaphors\u2014\u201cBut, believe it or not, at that very instant, an idea came flying out of nowhere and landed on my head, like a pigeon on a statue of Lord Nelson.\u201d The inclusion of rare and unusual bits of information, such as how one can cause oneself to blush, add to that which makes Bradley\u2019s writing so delightful.We do see changes and growth in the characters. It is nice that we see a new side of Flavia\u2019s sister, Feeley, at the same time as does she. We realize that Dogger is, in some ways, an older and more experienced version of Flavia. Although set in the 1950s, we are made aware of how recent was WWII, and of its impact through Dogger\u2019s incidence with PTSD. It\u2019s nice to see him develop as a character who is coming into his own. He is observant, rather wise; a father-figure, friend and advisor to Flavia\u2014\u201cI love it when Dogger talked like this. It made me feel that we were partners.\u201d Flavia is gaining some self-awareness and is maturing, yet Flavia is a character one either loves, or finds rather terrifying, or both.In spite of the title and the humor, this is no cozy. The mystery, and the investigation, is well-plotted and executed, with red herrings and well-done suspense. Bradley always plays fair with the readers, laying out the clues as we read. \u201cThe Grave\u2019s a Fine and Private Place\u201d is a captivating and delightful read, with a maturing Flavia, and a wonderful ending that leaves one very anxious for the next book.THE GRAVE\u2019S A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE (Hist Mys-Flavia de Luce- England-1952) \u2013 VG+\tBradley, Alan \u2013 9th in series\tDelacorte Press, Jan 2018"}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Certainly, for me anyway, more entertaining than the last #8 was. But it lost an entire star by not having the plot make any logical or practical sense whosoever. If you like snarky thoughts and self-evaluations at a speed of multiples a second per every situation or interaction with/ re Flavia, then you will love this one. It's so long in that category that at page 300, with some of the lengthy departures into poetry and symbolism- the entire became so stretched as to be tedious.No Gladys at all! A sacrilege. And yet Dogger with a few new characters like Mrs. Palmer and Claire made the entire readable for me. All of my most loved Flavia characteristics shone the most only during the diatom and other testings portions that she managed with Dogger. Hob was just left hanging for any conclusions or after effect. HUH? And several other characters were just not set well into the continuity of the whole tale or the ending of it at all. Like the Constable- but not only one or two. Three I can think of. With all that length- why?Much better in spirits of interchange between the sisters than the last 2 books were- but droves behind the sharpest chemistry nuance and unique eyes to what slithers all across the fields or places she roams within the Bishop's Lacey district of those first 3 Flavia books. The jolts between Flavia \"eras\" are severe in this series, book to book. And now we see what is coming up next in the last paragraph here of this longish novel for the scenario of the future/ next. And I'm afraid that this series has just about lost me for its flow.

Everything from the disheveled manor house, the horrid sisters, the housekeeper/cook that cannot really cook nor keep house, the general factotum Dogger\u2026 to last but not least Flavia herself, 11 year old chemist, lonely and very precocious.Now, imagine my surprise when I recommended this series to a friend and she did not like it because of Flavia. I nearly took offense, because at times, we do take insults to favourite fictional characters rather personal. Yet, thinking about it, I can see that Flavia may split the lovers and haters quite distinctly.I adore her. I laugh out loud reading it, I am often feeling very sad for her. I know there is a huge part of me that can identify my own 11 year old with Flavia.The series also captures a certain post-war mood in 1950ies Britain, the manors of the former rich now broke were falling apart, rationing was still going, it just did not really feel like a war had being won.I was delighted when I got send a digital ARC for book 9 in the series. Ecstatic. Delirious. And I immediately sat down and read it. The De Luce girls are on a little holiday, punting along a river, when Flavia accidentally (is there any other way) dead body floating in the river. More cannot be said about the plot as this is an ongoing series.Naturally, I highly recommend this. But start at the beginning. If you hate precocious children, this may not be for you.

I've been hooked on this precocious eleven, now twelve-year-old, since the first book in the series, Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie. Flavia's brilliant mind in chemistry and solving murders has filled each book with a magical presence. The setting, largely at her rundown family estate Buckshaw outside of the bucolic English hamlet of Bishop\u2019s Lacey in the 1950s adds charm to the quirky stories of murder and deceit in which Flavia seems to find herself. And, then the last book, Thrice the Branded Cat Hath Mew'd, has placed the series in a seemingly darker than usual place where readers looked to the current book, The Grave's a Fine and Private Place, to answer questions of what was to become of Flavia and her two tormenting sisters, Feely and Daffy, and the rest of the endearing household. Of course, no reader expects all her questions to be answered, but I very much needed a sense of direction from The Grave's a Fine and Private Place. I can't say that this was a favorite book in the series for me, but I do think Flavia grew up a lot in this book and is in a good place to take control of her destiny back into her own hands. It felt like a necessary book, to advance the direction of those characters we've come to love who reside at Buckshaw.

The main strength of this book is to reaffirm the relationships that are important to Flavia, particularly with her father's old best friend Dogger and her sisters.When the family is out for a row along the river, they get entangled with...a body. After some, in my opinion, rather too anatomically detailed investigation (this is Flavia, after all, and she has a stomach of iron), the story gets underway and introduces a cast of characters for this riverside town.The most interesting one (though given far too little page time) is Hob, the undertaker's young son. He's younger than Flavia and she neatly steps into the role of cool older kid. Not that she overdoes it. But it does allow her to exercise her growing-up skills in a new way that I thought was well done.I really liked the brief appearance at the end of one of Flavia's mentors, as it allows the reader to see just what kind of a niche she has now carved out for herself and how she is not the friendless child that she may have imagined herself at the very beginning of the series. Flavia has come a long way in spite of only aging a couple of years.

Thank you.I am so very pleased to see that book #10 in the Flavia de Luce series is back to 5 star status for me! Alan Bradley has given readers a twelve year old girl and a mystery situation we can fully accept and enjoy. This story picks up six months after the sad ending of the previous story and Flavia, Ophelia, Daphne, Dogger and Mrs. Mullet are suffering under their grief and the rigid decrees from Aunt Felicity. Everyone's future has been mapped out by that dynamic woman, but nothing says they all have to like it. It is Dogger who manages a holiday, a trip paddling down the river. With lazy days, picnics on the river bank and nights spent in inns along the way. Should anybody be surprised when they come to St.-Mildred's-in-the-Marsh, location of the \"Poisoning Parson's\" murders, and Flavia finds a dead body?This story is brimming full of the innocence and inventiveness of that chemist-cum-detective, Flavia. These people need to heal from their tremendous grief and this story gives each of them a way to do that. The improvised chemical experiments are exactly what I always enjoyed so much in most of the previous stories.

Alan Bradley consistently knocks it out of the park with each addition to his Flavia de Luce series. He writes so eloquently and fills each book with tidbits on chemistry, forensics, music, literature, and then there is the amazing story! I was struck at the end of this one by the constant character evolution we see from book 1 to this most recent book 9. This was amazing.  I enjoyed the countryside descriptions of the summer holiday Flavia is taking. It is a holiday from also the decisions that must be made (and also for us readers to await what will happen to Flavia, Buckshaw, and the rest of the family). Yet a holiday doesn't mean a reprieve from murder. When Flavia pulls a corpse by the mouth out the river; she is thrown into a case that will challenge her wits, skills, and lack of a handy laboratory. This book was filled with more chemistry, poisons, and forensic details than a few of its predecessors. I was impressed with the level of detail Bradley puts into the story- to the point of a bit of turned stomach over the corpse description (well done, Bradley!). Each book makes me love Flavia a bit more and worry over her (she'd hate that I even said that). She demonstrates more poise and self introspection in this one. I also appreciated more time with Dogger. All in all, it's a fantastic mystery that also has haunting, poignant moments that fans of the series will find tugging at their heart strings."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126296-kristy", "userReview": "In the ninth (! - how is that possible?) Flavia de Luce mystery, we see Flavia away from her home turf, as she and her sisters have been sent away from Buckshaw on a holiday to try to help them recover from the death of their father. But instead (of course) Flavia discovers a dead body. As the gang is boating, she drags her hand along the water, it snags on something and boom - she catches her fingers on a corpse. Only our Flavia! Of course, Flavia isn't content to leave things to the local Constable. The dead man is named Orlando, and his death leads Flavia into a world of a traveling circus, a famous Canon renowned for poisoning three women, and much more. I am an unabashed fan of Flavia and this book didn't disappoint. It has all the staples of an excellent Flavia novel-- a strong mystery to unravel and a bunch of clever, witty, and surprisingly uncanny lines from our beloved protagonist. By now, our dear twelve-year-old Flavia has been through a lot. She's more mature, and she's as feisty and clever as ever. I admit that some of the chemistry in these novels goes over my head (I'm not as smart as Flavia, and I'm completely fine admitting that). But I love the mystery plots, and more than that, I love Flavia. I've felt protective of her since the first novel, even though the thought of that would anger her more than anything. There's a good eclectic cast of supporting characters in this one, including an aged actor, an undertaker's son, and a woman who used to know Dogger. And, of course, we get some appearances from Flavia's ever-suffering sisters, Daffy and Feely. The best part of this novel, however, for me, was the strengthening relationship between Dogger and Flavia. Their bond is one of the highlights of the book. I love those two. By now, Flavia and Dogger feel like friends, or even family. It's a sign of how well Bradley writes and creates these characters that you feel so attached to them. Suffice to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. If you're a fan of Bradley's series, you probably will as well. If you haven't picked up this series, I do suggest starting near the beginning, as you'll form a better bond with the characters. But you will be able to jump in with this book, too, as the mystery stands alone. The ending of this one also leaves me excited and looking forward to what I hope will be book #10.

The de Luces and Dogger find ways to occupy themselves. I loved the relationship between Flavia and Dogger in this book, it was utterly delightful. Our main characters are in a different town so we don't see any of the familiar side characters that we know and love. The reason for the 3.5 rating is because of the ending. I felt it was incredibly rushed. Once the inspector came it was boom, boom, boom, book is done! I would've like to have seen the inspector interviewing the suspect even though Flavia deduced the reasons behind the murder. I don't know, it just felt way too quick. It could've used another 20-30 pages to come to a good ending. I enjoyed it nevertheless because I adore Flavia!"}, {"userName": "Suzze Tiernan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82901-suzze-tiernan", "userReview": "While on a getaway trip with Dogger and her sisters, Flavia finds a dead body.

When is the right time to give up a long-running series? Last I heard there were only going to be nine books in the series, but this is book nine, and no end in sight*? I'm just not enjoying them like I used to. Which is weird, because I still love Flavia, her family and friends and assorted hangers-on. But the mysteries and plots just don't do it for me anymore. I find myself having a really hard time keeping my attention on them. Even in this one, where Flavia actually has help from Dogger, Daphne and even Feely, in solving the mystery! Which was new.*Wikipedia says there will be one more book, but they could very easily extend the order again if they are still good sellers for the publisher.This picks up six months after the events of the last book, which ended on a whammy. Flavia, Dogger, Feely, and Daffy are on vacation after having spent the last six months in mourning. It was felt (by Aunt Felicity) that time lazing about on a river would do their souls good. What it actually does is make sure that Flavia encounters yet another dead body, this time she accidentally hooks her fingers in its mouth while trailing them in the aforementioned river. I gagged a little when I listened to that part. Flavia has been obsessing over a local murderer named Canon Whitbread, and it turns out that the corpse in the river is his estranged son, Orlando. A Flavia investigation ensues from there, and because she's in an all new location, not everyone is as willing to help her or give her access to things as they would be at home in Bishop's Lacey.I wish I could say I enjoyed this more, but I just didn't, and it makes me sad. I still love Flavia unapologetically, and enjoy what Bradley is doing with her characterization, but the plots just do not work for me, and I'm less willing to overlook it than I used to be.I will read book ten, I think, but if there's more after that, I'm probably out."}, {"userName": "Susan in NC", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883451-susan-in-nc", "userReview": "I always enjoy my outings with Flavia, but the last few books have left me concerned where she (or rather, where Alan Bradley), was taking the series.After a heartbreaking tragedy leaves Flavia and her two sisters devastated, Aunt Felicity has swept in from London to restore order - and see the girls and Dogger off on a short holiday. Of course, Flavia comes across a dead body as they slowly float down river on a boating trip...I couldn\u2019t help thinking, Three Men in a Boat meets Sherlock!Flavia, as usual, is sniffing around asking all sorts of questions and getting in over her head, and I, as usual, reach a point (usually about half-way) where I\u2019m wondering whether all of these red herrings measure up to anything, or am I confused because Flavia is twelve years old and I forget how her mind works.

I didn't totally follow the mystery in this one, but it didn't even matter because being inside Flavia's head was such a delight. I love her curiosity and her mix of casual arrogance and admitted naivete about certain matters. Her relationship with Dogger also really shone in this book. I highly recommend this series (start at the beginning though) and encourage everyone to listen to them on audio rather than reading them.
