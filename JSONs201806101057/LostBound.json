She was very, very wrong. Instead of arriving and meeting the family she would be a nanny for she was kidnapped and sold as a sex slave. That was almost three years ago and by now she's given up all hope of ever leaving her hell. But then Callum show's up and he may just be the savior she's been hoping for. If he doesn't get captured himself, that is. This is my first read by Tara Hart so I wasn't too sure what to expect going in, but I was hoping for an actual dark story, and I got exactly what I hoped for. Leila was stuck in a twisted and very messed up situation with her captor and sometimes it broke my heart. From the beginning I could tell she was strong and I liked after so long being a slave for a sick and demented man she still had her fighting spirit.There were so many different ways that this story could have gone and ended, and I really liked that I was kept on the edge of my seat from when I first started. Even when I thought I knew what would happen I would be proven wrong, which doesn't happen much. Callum was a complete mystery as to how his characters role would play out, but I ended up loving him and especially him with Leila. Overall, this was a good dark story. The subject matter isn't going to be for everyone but if you have a twisted mind like mine than I think it's the perfect book for you.ARC kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "NMmomof4", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24665574-nmmomof4", "userReview": "[The GoodUnique Take on the Captive ThemeAt least I've never read a book that had this type of approach. It is based on a male mc, Callum, that comes home to visit his father after ~3 years (I think) to find out that his father has taken a sex slave, Leila. They both lost his mother 5 years prior, so he figures that his father has just lost his mind because of his grief -- especially because his father calls the h \"Emmy\" which was his nickname for the mom. I've read captivity book where there is the H that is in with the bad men, but ends up helping the h in the end -- but this is different because the H is an outsider to what has been going on (for at least 2 years). So, the fact that it was a different take on the whole captivity scene was good.The BadUnbelievable InstaloveI know a lot of people are all about instalove, but I am usually not a fan. I can deal with mcs moving quickly as long as I understand why they have developed stronger feelings (or at least get to experience it). I couldn't deal with this. They don't say the \"I love yous\", but they are acting as though they are in love almost immediately. They only have a few interactions, and they never have anything happen that would make me believe the strong feelings are justified. With the h, the only thing I could think of was that I could attribute it to the fact that she's been held captive and is craving any kind of positive attention to the point that it is a kind of Stockholm syndrome by projecting it to the H instead of her captor. The H?!? I have no idea! Maybe it was just insta-super-strong-attraction-and-must-save-her going on, but I just didn't get it. He reacted to her as if he had strong feelings, and he didn't know her or have anything really to back it up IMO!The HAlong with the instalove, he had weird interactions with side characters. He didn't seem like the sharpest tool in the shed. During a sex party of his dad's that he crashes, he notices that his uncle (who happens to be the chief of police) was visibly cringing and averting his eyes when the slaves were \"performing\" a sex act with each other for the crowd. Hello?!? Use that to your advantage! Talk to him, and feel him out! He might be an ally and help you save the girl!! There's also some interactions with a friend and a guy that helps him get the tracker off the h that I found myself rolling my eyes over. In every scene he has a beer or some other type of alcoholic beverage. Don't get me wrong -- I like to have some drinks on occasion, but what is that all about? Pretty much every scene?!?The \"Chemistry\"Or the lack of chemistry would be better worded. I didn't feel any connection to either characters, and I didn't feel their connection to each other either. I didn't necessarily like either one either. The UglyThe \"Intimacy\" and RapeThere were some cringe-worthy moments where the h was pretty desperate for the H to be intimate with her. I understand wanting physical affection, but getting all hot and bothered by him right after getting raped or abused in front a group of nasty men? Not so much. In my mind it was actually making the severity of her abuse not a big deal, and I thought that was rather insulting to victims of sex crimes. Don't get me wrong -- I've read captivity books where the h and H have sex. That's not my issue. My issue is that she was so desperate for it and all the H would say when he turned her down was \"you'll think of him\" then she would get pissy and hurt (and he wouldn't really further explain his reasoning). She is supposed to have been held captive for over 2 years and had been abused since her 2nd week there!! Someone that had gone through that trauma would have some type of reaction other than just being horny and wanting to jump all over a good looking man. Maybe I'm wrong...but I personally found the whole thing kind of offensive. Just FYI -- rape went on in detail up until I threw in my towel. I also figure that any man would have issues with a woman that had been intimate (even forced) with his own father. Right?!? I get wanting to save her, but he even saw his father raping her. Maybe I'm being super insensitive, but how can that not affect his attraction?

This book contains disturbing situations, graphic depictions of rape, strong language and violence.Twenty-One year old Leila is travelling to the United States of America towards her new nanny job relishing in her new found freedom of working abroad. Instead of arriving at her new position, she's kidnapped and sold as a sex slave to William Osborne whose the Mayor of a small town in America called Merling.Barely speaking any English, confused, and scared, she doesn't fully understand what's happening to her.2 years38 weeks4 daysThat\u2019s how long Leila has been held captive for, in a basement\nThe above part is glossed over, so your not privy to the full brutal grittiness of the kidnapping, which is what one would expect with the nature of this book. I think if it was depicted in more detail it would be darker than what it is, but this would be a stepping stone for first time readers of a dark genre. Callum hasn't been to his childhood home in three years when he makes an unexpected visit to his father's house he's confronted by a foreign woman welding a knife. He quickly uncovers that she is being held captive by his father, a tracking device on her wrist.\n I notice her ankles. They are red and swollen. Thick gouges mar her skin as if she's been tied up. \nCallum starts to question everything he ever thought he knew about his father.  Dad has been a recluse since my mum died.With the help of his childhood friend they come up with a way to try and break Leila out from his father's home. I enjoyed the suspense of this story, sit on the edge of your seat waiting to see what the author was going to throw at me next, loved the build up of these two characters and their subsequent attraction towards each other, to be a dark read for me the author would've had to go into more details of the actual kidnapping, the feels that went coursing through her mind, those are what I felt were missing, but for ones just stepping towards the dark genre this would be perfect for them, as it's not too dark, but it is gritty. *Teaser used in my review is off the Authors FB page*"}, {"userName": "Dusti Hanrahan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24901178-dusti-hanrahan", "userReview": "3.75 starsI need to think on this...

This book is unlike anything I've ever read. It's dark, twisted, heart-wrenching, but hopeful & beautiful all in the same. This story isn't for the faint of heart. It's very raw and has detail of rape. It's very tastefully done and not too graphic in my opinion. If there's one word that I would use to describe this story it's HOPE. Callum hasn't been home in years and when he makes an unexpected visit to his father's house he's confronted by a foreign woman holding a knife. He quickly learns that this woman is being held at the house against her will in the house he grew up in ... the events that follow make Callum realize the facade he always knew existed about his father is actually true. Leila thought she was dead, not physically but mentally, she had no reason to believe her life would ever change but then Callum came home.Give this book a try, I almost plead that you do. It's a story that stays with you but not in a bad way even though much of this story is anything but pleasant.

Letting himself into the house, he encounters a girl dressed scantily who pulls a knife on him. Did she break in? Callum is shocked when the stranger tells him that she\u2019s being held captive by his father. The story only gets more bizarre from there and Callum doesn\u2019t know what to believe, but he does know he should help this desperate girl. Perhaps his father is not who Callum thinks he is.\u201cMy father held this girl captive. A foreign girl that no one would miss and no one would come looking for.

I love how she tracked time from when she was sold into sexual slavery and then after she met Callum. I couldn't help but put myself in either of their shoes and think what I would have done if everything I thought I knew about my father was a lie. I was on pins and needles wondering how he might save her when twists fly out of nowhere. Sometimes I wondered if his father could get any more deranged.

To be quite honest... I was expecting something a little more darker. As I kept reading... I just kept thinking there had to have been a faster way to help Leila out. Then the route Callum had taken to help Leila. He was a writer for a U.S. Newspaper. Your going to tell me he couldn't contact anyone to help him out faster? I mean... There was just so many opportunities he could have taken before everything all went down.I'm sorry... I just wasn't buying it all. And I just felt if it wasn't one thing it was another in the attempts to help Leila and himself out. Everything he did it seemed to fail for him. The knife scene in the end was like a big COME ON moment for me.William's chapter didn't really make sense to me. I felt like his chapter should have been in the beginning of the book. It just seemed like to me it was just thrown in. It did not flow for me after what just went down in the previous chapter.Leila's character.... I just felt there was something missing for me in her.

This book i really liked. The leading male in the story is one that is quiet different from any other male in a romance novel. In this book the leading male is a man who tries to save the woman he loves nearly succeeds. However, he and the woman he loves are recaptured and held in captivity. What I like about the leading male is how he isn't the macho type who was instantly able to save the day. He wasn't some macho muscle headed guy who knows how to fight and use weapons. He is just an ordinary man who can only do the best he can. What I secondly especially love about this book that it is the woman who is able to kill the evil doer and not only save herself but also the man she loves.

As a lover of dark reads I did not find this book to be that dark, I didn't find the language to be as bad as it heeds in its warning. The language in this book is light compared to Some YA reads I've read. The sex scenes in this book are lacking, does it involve rape? Yes simply because Leila is not willing, however we do not get a graphic horror stricken scene that you would find in dark reads. The story is about a girl from Brazil who is suppose to be coming to America to live with a family, instead she is captured. We do not see the scene in which she's captured, we see where the man who bought her has her as a prisoner in his home, even there we don't see much. We meet Callum who is the buyers son, now unlike most dark reads the men who save the woman/women are strong and fearless, Callum is none of that, the minute he's caught trying to help Leila escape he's beaten, and doesn't attempt to fight back, he basically just succumbs to his fate and gives up, although he has strong feelings for Leila, he's to quick to want to die. Here she's been kept as a prisoner and gone through what she says is hell, ( we do not see much here either, if it was not for her two minute rape sessions it kind of appears to not be a bad deal)he's ready to die within a week of being captive. I don't mind a weak man, but this is beyond weak, he should have been a young kid, he doesn't seem to have a back bone at all. All in all this book is a page turner, the ending is good, it's a quick paced read, but it's just lacking the darkness. If you like a dark read, this book is not for you. Happy reading :)"}, {"userName": "Michelle Turner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12789450-michelle-turner", "userReview": "What a shame, the beginning for me was a nice twist to the usual captive books that ive read but unfortunately mid way through the story seemed to lose its way considerably and i quickly lost interest. It lacked depth and believability."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Readz", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11659152-tiffany-readz", "userReview": "3.5 Stars. Not My Kind of DarkAs a fan of the dark genre, with the likes of Pepper Winters, CJ Roberts, Lili St. Germain and Mary E. Palmerin, this book didn't come close to what I thought it was. With Lost and Bound we get a story of survival more so than the dark storyline I am a fan of. The concept was different, and felt a bit let down with the warning that came with the book.Emmy is a girl in the wrong place at the wrong time. She is the victim of something we all worry about, human trafficking. Even worse, she is held by a man of power. A man that nobody would suspect. A man that has gotten away with having Emmy for years. So long she doesn't know who she really is anymore and dreams of ever going home are long.Callum is shocked when he stumbles upon Emma, even more so when he realizes how she was acquired. No matter how powerful this man is, he won't stand in the way of her rescue. Getting her to a safe place will be easier said than done once he realizes how deep the man's connection to Emmy is. The book is well written from dual points of view, however the storyline didn't hold my interest. I felt it was predictable and a bit boring at times.
