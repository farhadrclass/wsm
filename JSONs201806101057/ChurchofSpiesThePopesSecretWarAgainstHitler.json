He would engage the German military resistance and encourage a conservative counterrevolution. He would serve as secret foreign agent for the resistance\u2014presenting and guaranteeing its plans to the British. He would partner with the generals not just to stop the war, but to eliminate Nazism by removing Hitler.Right after WWII, the Soviets began a misinformation campaign claiming Pope Pius XII supported the Nazi regime. Jewish praise and testimony squashed that early effort, but it has been popping up ever since, from various anti-Catholic sources. Many historians have defended the pope but somehow what grabs the headlines is always the sensational anti-Catholicism which keeps rearing its head.Church of Spies\u00a0ably defends Pope Pius with an action-packed story and over 100 pages of footnotes and sources from recently uncovered documents. \u00a0Let's say right up front that author Mark Riebling is not a Catholic, in fact is a fallen-away Catholic, so he's speaking from a purely historical standpoint which I appreciate. He's got no axe to grind other than reporting history properly.We learn that Pope Pius provided an incomparable network for passing information from deep within the German government to Britain and America. Simultaneously, the information gatherers became conspirators who vowed to take action themselves. With the pope's approval.As a reader, the best part is that this reads like a spy thriller, from the beginning where the pope has the Papal Library wired with the best surveillance technology of the time to the end where we see conspirators stage a daring prison break in the Alps. In between, there were Jesuits with guns, double agents, incriminating notes swallowed, \u00a0escapes across rooftops, notes passed through prison laundries, and much more. This is all intercut with Hitler's real time actions which lends context and immediacy to the story.I also found it very uplifting. Whether Catholic or not (Dietrich Bonhoeffer was among their number), these men were willing to sacrifice themselves to save others and stop evil. Some of the examples in the personal stories have inspired me since I read them. Church of Spies is a story that resonates in our own time as well as providing us with heroes for WWII.They had found many compromising documents in the army safe at Zossen. M\u00fcller might as well consider himself a dead man.M\u00fcller said evenly that he could accept that. Death meant \"just a passage from this life to the next,\" Sonderegger later quoted him as saying. Sonderegger asked M\u00fcller whether he prayed. M\u00fcller said he did. Did he pray for the SS, too? Sonderegger asked. M\u00fcller said yes, he prayed for his enemies most of all.Sonderegger fell quiet for a moment. Then, saying he would return \"in three minutes,\" he put a sheet of paper on the table. ...This book should lay to rest any questions of Pius XXII being \"Hitler's Pope.\" Hitler knew to fear the Church's opposition. Now the story has been thoroughly and thrillingly told. The record is finally set straight.It would make an exhilarating mini-series! C'mon Amazon ... Netflix ...

In spite of his intelligence and long experience in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, Pius XII (he was Eugenio Pacelli prior to being named Pope in March 1939) had struck me as a 'cold fish.' But after reading this book, I am beginning to realize that, perhaps, there was much more to Pius XII than met the eye. \"CHURCH OF SPIES\" lays out, in considerable detail, the history of the resistance movement against Hitler, which began before the war among a number of the German Catholic bishops and lay authorities (along with some members of the German military - e.g., the leadership of the Abwehr or military intelligence) and was given added (albeit indirect) impetus by Pius XII from the earliest days of his pontificate. Besides Pope Pius XII, the book brings to the fore a number of courageous, resourceful and highly astute individuals from the ranks of the German Catholic hierarchy (as well as the Protestant theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer) and Wehrmacht (German armed forces) who formed the bulwark of a true German anti-Nazi resistance. One of them who most stands out in my mind for his amazing bravery and uncompromising commitment to humane principles, is Josef M\u00fcller. M\u00fcller, a First World War veteran and lawyer, had his first brush with the Nazis in 1934. He had been arrested by the Gestapo in February of that year and charged with \"a treasonable conspiracy ... punishable by death.\" Facing his accusers, M\u00fcller asserted that there could be no compromise between the Church and the Reich because \"each demanded 'the soul of the man.' \" Heinrich Himmler, the head of the Schutzstaffel (later to be better known as the SS) was present at M\u00fcller's interrogation and asked him if it were true that M\u00fcller had suggested to his friend Heinrich Held (the prime minister of Bavaria, where M\u00fcller was active in the Bavarian People's Party) during the Nazi takeover of Bavaria that Himmler be shot. M\u00fcller said that was so, much to Himmler's surprise! Himmler hadn't seen that coming. He was very much taken aback by M\u00fcller's candor. He then offered him a place in the SS. M\u00fcller refused, stating that \"I am philosophically opposed to you. I am a practicing Catholic, and my brother is a Catholic priest. Where could I find the possibility of compromise there?\" Himmler was flummoxed and awed by M\u00fcller. He congratulated M\u00fcller on his \"manly defense\" and let him go.M\u00fcller would later become a part of the resistance within Germany and serve as a go-between to Pius XII. This book, which often read like an espionage thriller, gave me so much to think about concerning the anti-Hitler resistance that, hitherto, I couldn't have imagined existed in Germany to the extent that it did. After all, once Hitler assumed full control of Germany following the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in August 1934, I had long thought after having previously read in years past many other books about the Third Reich, that the Nazis had established a binding, absolute hold over the country. Well, that hold wasn't airtight. And now that I've read \"CHURCH OF SPIES\", I would like to know more about the role of Pius XII and the Church in fighting Nazism during the Second World War. My curiosity has been piqued. [As an aside, I am still troubled by the fact that a number of Catholic priests after the War helped Nazi war criminals escape justice in Europe and find sanctuary in South America. Did Pius XII know about or condone their activities? I would like to know the answer to that question. ]I can't rate this book with 5 stars, however, because the author neglected to include any photos of the principal members of the anti-Hitler resistance. (I would've loved to have been able to place faces with the names of all the resisters that Mark Riebling mentioned throughout the book.) For that reason, I can only rate \"CHURCH OF SPIES\" with 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos", "userReview": "No, this book did not convince me , the author didn't show his research or said where he had found these \"new never seen documents\" in which this book is based , no you can't go from a passive almost pathetic approach to a human crisis happening rigth next to you (as it was the case of Pius the 12th) to a book revealing that basically the pope was responsible for everything , (the fall of Mussolini, all the murder attempts to hitler life and the fall of nazi Germany ) under the pretense that he was afraid to speak up because it might have been repercussions to German Catholics , please 60 million people died on ww2 , the least you could have done was speak up...... This book seemed like it had an agenda to portray Pius the 12th as a \"covert hero\" but I'm not convinced by this rhetoric and more important because of the lack of evidence , and if you think the Vatican was actually trying to help \"Jewish people\" I would recommend you read \"gods bankers\" , a very well researched book about the ties of the Nazi movement and the Holy See."}, {"userName": "Jeff Miller", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947630-jeff-miller", "userReview": "I was somewhat aware of the various controversies surrounding Pope Pius XII who was the Pope during WWII up to 1958. I remember the book \u201cHitler\u2019s Pope\u201d which I once saw for sale at a retreat center. Since that book came out their have been various books defending the Pope and setting the record straight in regards to helping the Jewish people. I also knew how the Rolf Hochhuth\u2019s 1968 anti-Pius play \u201cThe Deputy\u201d did much to change what was previously a favorable view of the Pope during WWII. That the play might well have been part of a KGB-led disinformation campaign.So I thought I had a pretty good grasp regarding Pope Pius XII efforts to save Jews during WWII, which was mostly a behind-the-scenes effort. Then I heard author Mark Riebling being interviewed on Al Kresta\u2019s show regarding his book \u201cChurch of Spies: The Pope\u2019s Secret War Against Hitler\u201d.When he learned of the Holocaust, Pius played his cards close to his chest. He sent birthday cards to Hitler\u2014while secretly plotting to kill him.Church of Spies documents this cloak and dagger intrigue in shocking detail. Gun-toting Jesuits stole blueprints to Hitler\u2019s homes. A Catholic book publisher flew a sports plane over the Alps with secrets filched from the head of Hitler\u2019s bodyguard. The keeper of the Vatican crypt ran a spy ring that betrayed German war plans and wounded Hitler in a briefcase bombing.That the Pope actually plotted to have Hitler killed seems to actually be accurate and this book details this. That the Pope took efforts regarding this on his own initiative and worked to separate this as an official act for the Vatican. That in this case he thought Tyrannicide to be warranted. The book is just full of interesting details regarding this. One tidbit was the installation of a Marconi wire recorder in the Vatican to record conversations covertly.One of the central figures in the book is Josef M\u00fcller. His story is one of those that would seem outlandish in a novel. A lawyer who defended Nazi opponents including Jewish people and was part of the Catholic resistance against Nazi Germany. He was a central figure in carrying out a coup and passing intelligence personally to Pope Pius XII along with British intelligence. How he achieved this is simply astounding considering the watchful eyes he was under. He was later arrested, imprisoned, tortured repeatedly, and scheduled for execution. That he survived all this is another amazing story. Especially considering his connection to the various plots to assassinate Hitler including Operation Valkyrie with Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg."}, {"userName": "Ionia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16434239-ionia", "userReview": "I was both surprised and enthralled by this book from the beginning. Whilst I expected the author to have a compelling argument and evidence to support his ideas, he also managed to craft a book that was interesting and kept my attention throughout. As someone who loves history, it is hard for me to pass up a title that promises to look at something from a new angle. Mark Riebling offered that, and did an excellent job of supporting his claims. I have to say, after reading this, I agree with his assessment of the situation. There was a lot I didn't know about the Pope's standpoint on the Nazi movement and the involvement of the Catholic Church, and I walked away feeling better informed after having read this.

The narrative is fast moving and full of thrills.History has not been kind to Pope Pius XII. He is probably the most hated pope in modern history. The church took a lot of criticism for seeming to side with Hitler and do nothing while he tried to eradicate the Jews. This book has a different story to tell. Newly discovered documents show that the church actively worked to undermine Hitler. Working with a large group of Vatican operatives and a network that extended into the German resistance, the church actually had a hand in three attempts to assassinate Hitler.One of the main characters is Josef M\u00fcller, nicknamed as Joey Ox, and he was sent on a series of trips to the Vatican carrying correspondence. Being caught with this would have meant his death. Another is Wilhelm Canaris, who was a German admiral and chief of the German military intelligence service. He decided that Germany couldn't win this war, and joined the opposition to overthrow Hitler.The Vatican had a secret radio room that was set up by Marconi. Information flowed smoothly as the church was without suspicion, but the life of resistance is not glamorized, and many who were captured were tortured and killed. It's a fascinating book, and I found the way it was told to be gripping. Even though the outcome of the war is known, Mark Riebling knows how to tell a true story very well.I received a review copy of this ebook from Basic Books and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

It represents a kind of \u201cparadigm-shift\u201d from the many recent books that have attempted to portray Pope Pius XII as a Hitler-supporting, Anti-Semitic, crypto-Nazi. The paradigm shift is long in coming, and represents nothing more than a return to the original sources of history, where the idea of Pius as being in any way a supporter of Hitler would have been considered the height of insanity.I have been reading up on the contemporary sources for a few years now. That exercise has marked me with the realization that history is a communal enterprise, subject to fads and, of course, laziness. Starting with \u201cThe Deputy,\u201d it seems that there has been a thread of historians that have competed with each other in their anti-Pius depictions. What has happened is that each successive writer, selects more of the anti-Pius material to incorporate into their narrative and chooses to leave out the data that might distract from their thesis. The net result after a dozen iterations is a history that looks nothing like the history that people actually experienced.The thread I am describing is obviously the leftist, secularist, anti-Catholic thread, together with a leftist Catholic thread that has the papacies of John Paul II and Benedict XVI in their sights. We might chalk up the ratcheting of a falsified history to nothing more than human laziness and the eagerness to tell a story that fits the narrative except for the facts that, (a) as Justin Lawler has established, a lot of the anti-Pius narrative is actually fabricated and (b) when you read histories from outside this thread, the actual fact that the Catholic Church opposed Hitler and National Socialism are accepted as trivial truths.This book begins with the little-known fact that Pius permitted the Vatican to be used as a conduit for anti-Hitler conspiracies. This fact has been acknowledged by even John Cornwell in \u201cHitler\u2019s Pope.\u201d In a revision of his book, Cornwell was forced to acknowledge that he didn\u2019t really mean that Pius was a Hitler supporter \u2013 something impossible to propose in the face of the fact that Pius had inconiently participated in conspiracies to overthrow or kill Hitler \u2013 but that he meant something far vaguer and less likely to sell books.Riebling\u2019s book takes this fact and investigates the backstory, and what a backstory it is. We are introduced to Joseph Muller, a Bavarian Catholic lawyer who acted as a linchpin between the Canaris group, which was trying to overthrow Hitler from within the German military, and the Catholic resistance, which brought in Dietrich Bonhoeffer to win over Protestants, and the Vatican, which had to intervene with the Allies in order to broker a peace once Hitler was overthrown. Riebling\u2019s story shows the white-knuckled bravery of the resistance: we see Canaris\u2019s last days and we learn how close Mueller was to being executed like all the rest of the resistance, but for some last minute turns of good fortune.Riebling\u2019s story is extremely well-researched in the original German sources. I\u2019ve done a lot of reading on this period and I haven\u2019t heard these stories, but they fit what I do know. For example, one of Riebling\u2019s claims is that Pius\u2019s purported silence arose from the request of the German Resistance that he be silent so as not to draw attention to Catholics in Germany. This is the mirror image of a story validated by the American adjutant to the Ambassador to the Holy See, Harold Tittman, Jr., who wrote the following. Here is the passage from Tittman's memoirs (which is actually a postscript from Tittman's son)://My fathers memoirs ended with his move out of the Vatican in July 1944, but it is appropriate to conclude the story of his Vatican assignment by reproducing a memorandum he wrote to Myron Taylor on June 4, 1945, reporting on a conversation with Dr. Josef Mueller, a Bavarian Catholic lawyer who had been a leading figure in the anti-Nazi German underground movement and had acted as the liaison between that movement and the Holy See. My father met Mueller following a speech by the Pope to the College of Cardinals on June 2, 1945, during which the Pope had severely castigated National Socialism and had referred to the deaths of 2000 Catholic priests at Dachau.FOR THE AMBASSADOR June 4, 1945Dr. Mueller told me last night that contrary to what I had heard, he had no part in drafting any part of the Pope\u2019s speech, but that he had furnished the Holy Father with the information on which certain passages were based.Dr. Mueller said that during the war his anti-Nazi organization in Germany had always been very insistent that the Pope should refrain from making any public statement singling out the Nazis and specifically condemning them and had recommended that the Pope\u2019s remarks should be confined to generalities only. Dr. Mueller said that he was obliged to give this advice, since, if the Pope had been specific, Germans would have accused him of yielding to the promptings of foreign powers and this would have made the German Catholics even more suspected than they were and would have greatly restricted their freedom of action in their work of resistance to the Nazis. Dr. Mueller said that the policy of the Catholic resistance in Germany was that the Pope should stand aside while the German hierarchy carried out the struggle against the Nazis inside Germany, without outside influence being brought to bear. Dr. Mueller said that the Pope had followed this advice throughout the war.I then said to Dr. Mueller that I had heard rather widespread criticism of the Pope in connection with his latest speech, because he had waited until Germany had been defeated before attacking the Nazis in public. Dr. Mueller said that he had already explained why the Pope had maintained silence during the war. He imagined that the Pope had decided to come out in the open now against the Nazis because the implications in the denunciations were so very important at the present time and seemed to the Pope to override other considerations.//(See Inside the Vatican of Pius XII: The Memoir of an American Diplomat During World War II.)I had a moment of chill when I got the end of Riebling\u2019s book and I realized that the Dr. Mueller I had been reading about in Reibling had a cameo in Tittman\u2019s book. In the Tittman memoir, \u201cDr. Mueller\u201d comes on stage and delivers his lines and leaves. To get the backstory and to understand why Dr. Mueller knew what he knew was mind-blowing.I was surprised by the extent of information that Riebling had on Canaris. I\u2019ve read other books about Canaris and they didn\u2019t hint at the amount of information known about his death or the extent of his involvement with the Papacy (although, I believe that Cornwell alludes to the Canaris connection.)Another interesting detail is Riebling\u2019s explanation for why there was no Protestant resistance comparable to the Catholic resistance. I was surprised to find that Bonhoeffer was part of the Catholic resistance, although I knew that Stauffenberg was Catholic. Riebling\u2019s explanation was that Catholicism had a doctrine of just resistance to tyranny, which, while difficult to trigger, did provide an intellectual escape hatch for Catholics that did not exist for Protestants. I also suspect that there was also a history of German Catholic \u201cresistance\u201d to integration in the German culture, which expressed itself in a distaste with hyper-nationalism, or, because of the tendency of people to react against the mainstream, in the hypernationalism of apostate Catholics like Goebbels, Streicher and Hitler. Catholics, unlike Protestants, were confronted with the choice between nationalism or faith, and the choosing led to a variety of options from resistance to apostatic hypernationalism.Obviously, real history is far more interesting than the Monday-morning quarterbacking moralizing of modern historians who have been blessedly spared from the duty of making difficult choices.This is an interesting book. It is an adventure story. It deserves to be a movie. The men who gave their lives in resisting Hitler deserve to be remembered and not tossed down the memory hole so that modern writers can score points against their modern enemies."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123535-brandon", "userReview": "Not surprised that I thoroughly enjoyed this work considering my obsession with WWII history and the fact that it centered on previously unbeknownst secrets and strategies from German (anti-Nazi) resistance and papal/clergy resistance.

Reibling handily demonstrates that Pope Pius XII was not only deeply opposed to Hitler and the National Socialists but also involved in assisting the German resistance in its attempts to assassinate Hitler. The book is so heavily documented that denial of this has to rely on special pleading (viz. a deliberate ignoring of the facts of the case). While Reibling acknowledges some are critical of Pius XII for not being more vocal in his opposition to Hitler and the persecution of the Jews he also documents the fact that each time the pope or individual bishops spoke out the Nazis followed by persecuting even more violently the Church, the Jews, and perhaps especially Catholics of Jewish descent. One may disagree with Pius' prudential judgment to keep silent and work behind the scenes with those Germans who desired to hold a coup and return Germany to sanity but the historical record is clear that speaking out resulted in more deaths in every instance. One interesting detail that Reibling highlights is that it was the Bavarian Catholics who were most interested in and willing to hold a coup, even if it meant assassinating Hitler. Reibling points out that the teaching that tyrants can be removed or even killed was presented by figures such as St. Thomas Aquinas and expounded by Jesuit theologians through history. It was the Protestant Germans who were hesitant at opposing Hitler because of Martin Luther's influence. Reibling quotes Luther as saying: \"I would rather suffer a prince doing wrong than a people doing right\" and that \"Disobedience is a greater sin than murder.\" While Dietrich Bonhoeffer's resistance to Hitler is well know, what is not common knowledge is that he did not agree with the decision to kill Hitler until after coming under the influence of a Catholic priest.If I have one quibble with Reibling it is a matter of format. Throughout the text any time a regnal number is used it is spelled out instead of being represented by a Roman numeral. Thus, Pope Pius XII is consistently referred to as Pope Pius the twelfth.

So Pope Pius XII decided to go the espionage route instead of speaking out too loud, which history has criticized him for.This was one of the few times (notwithstanding the middle ages) the Church has greenlit an assassination. It was interesting to see how so many of the plots to kill Hitler were connected to the Vatican (remember the movie Valkyrie?). It was also interesting to see how many countries, Catholic and Protestant alike, saw the Vatican as the country that could be the central communicator regarding secret attempts at coups and brokering peace. I have said it twice now: interesting. This was a very interesting book; not as much as a nailbiter as I thought it would be. At times it was frustrating with all the names to keep straight. But Riebling did some EXCELLENT research (note the thickness of the reference notes section at the end).I think this book would make an awesome mini-series on HBO or something, bringing to life a story that has mostly been the shadows of the espionage world it originated in."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Blake", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2139985-jeffrey-blake", "userReview": "One of the controversies over the role of the Catholic Church during World War II is whether or not the church, or more specifically the Pope, did all he could to counter the atrocities being committed by the Nazi's. Pope Pius XII mentioned the Jews only once during the war, that at his first encyclical, and never again until the conclusion of the war. Riebling's well documented history dispels this notion of indifference and shows Pius as deeply troubled by what he knew of both Hitler's tactics and aims, but even more importantly, how deeply involved the pontiff was in covert activities designed at deposing the dictator. Pius justified his actions from the teaching of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who considered tyrannicide justified if there was no other way to protect the innocent. As Reibling explains, through the story of so many heroic Germans, (none more so than the Catholic lawyer from Munich, Joseph Mueller) the Pope's silence was very much in order to prevent even more atrocities as Hitler was consistently looking to target the church. The book includes 104 pages of chapter notes that are easily as fascinating as the book."}, {"userName": "Tyson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60323116-tyson", "userReview": "This book was a great read, far from many other history books, Church of Spies reads like a thriller.

Using records from Germany\u2019s Institute f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte and from the Vatican Secret Archives, Church of Spies casts light on WWII covert operations and spycraft that remained in the shadows for 75 years. Perhaps most-earth shattering and historically game-changing is the proof that a modern Pope, running a vast intelligence network inside Germany, green-lighted Hitler\u2019s assassination, something neither FDR or Churchill, so far as we know, risked their reputations to do.\"Church of Spies\" will inspire many Catholics. It brings to life the heroic priests and ordinary faithful who did not sit on their hands, and who shed their own blood in the Pope\u2019s high-stakes espionage to stop the Third Reich.This book will also interest students of the Holocaust. It provides new context for evaluating Pope Pius XII, who opted for quiet clandestine operations instead of loud public speeches. Although not uncritical of Pius \u2013 Riebling writes that \"he should have spoken out\" \u2013 the book shows the German resistance itself begged the Pope not to do or say anything publicly that would cause retribution against Catholics in Germany who were concurrently planning assassinations and coups against the Third Reich.Written with the attention to detail that one finds in Rick Atkinson's Pulitzer Prize winning World War II books, Church of Spies reads like a thriller. But the nearly 100 pages of source citations remind us that what happened here is true. And savoring that truth makes reading \u201cChurch of Spies\u201d all the more compelling."}, {"userName": "Scribe Publications", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3746214-scribe-publications", "userReview": "Mark Riebling provides the first fully satisfactory portrait of the most elusive and certainly the most divisive pope in modern history.

The record of the assistance Pius XII provided, through his representatives, to the German resistance, and the actions they took, under his guidance, is extraordinary.

This book explains that Hitler would have increased his persecution Catholics if the Pope was more vocal. Maybe even attacked the Vatican. Of course this was after the Pope made the same mistake as other leaders in trying to accommodate Germany and their plan for world domination. It is good to hear he was very active in encouraging a regime change in Germany but I can't help thinking the Catholic Church could of done more to protect and save the Jewish people.
