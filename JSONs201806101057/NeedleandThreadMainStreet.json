My main gripe is that, because of the choppy story-telling that jumps between different characters and often takes an omniscient look at all the characters, I'm not entirely sure what age this book would be suitable for. I read the Babysitters Club books when I was about eight, but they were far more structured. But would this book seem too babyish to someone a bit older? I'm also not sure how the sewing shop would appeal to girls that age, but this book did have a bit of everything in it - Nikki's abusive father, Olivia's parents needing new jobs, the older woman with Alzheimer's, getting a new teacher, Ruby balancing all her activities, their first Thanksgiving without their parents, and so on. A lot of topics are covered in these books, so I hope kids don't find it too much. But there is something incredibly sweet and comforting about Camden Falls. I hope these books are just as relevant when I have kids. And if I don't have girls, I'm going to have some very open-minded sons, considering how big my Ann M. Martin collection is now! 3.5*"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4754277-jessica", "userReview": "This is a fun series for young girls. There are a lot of characters with interesting backgrounds and stories that are constantly evolving. Ann M. Martin is wonderful at writing books that match seasons. These books are great at making the reader get the feeling of the season that the book is taking place in. I especially love her books that take place in fall. She weaves in descriptions of change that make you long for that time of year. This one was my favorite of the series because it had some great character growth."}, {"userName": "Hanna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3841626-hanna", "userReview": "The Main Street series by Ann M.

School has started and three of the girls are about to begins 6th grade, with Ruby starting 4th. The girls were so excited to have Mrs. Mandel, an incredibly popular teach and are devastated when she announces she is retiring after Thanksgiving to be with her family. The group is also planning for Halloween and the make a bear sewing class that Flora suggested. The book jumps from girl to girl, and even gives a peak at the other families living in the row houses.Flora, is struggling with the notion that this will be the first holiday season without her parents. She is the pushing force behind the sewing class for children. All the bears made in the class are to be donated to a local charity group that helps children in need. Nikki continues to deal with alcoholic parents. Her father rules with an iron fist and does anything to keep the children under control. Tobias, Nikki\u2019s oldest brother is now beginning to stand up to their father, which seems to tighten his grip on Nikki and Mae. Nikki continues to feed the stray dogs around her house, but struggles with keeping it a secret from her father.Olivia\u2019s 10th birthday is approaching and with her parents not working, there is little hope for a party. Her mother is planning on going back to work while her father looks for a new job. She continues to make excellent grades.Ruby the youngest of the group, and personally my least favorite character, throws herself into everything. She tries out for the chorus and the play. She is also to begin dance classes in Camden Falls. She has to always be in the spotlight, yet her grades are suffering. I think this book touches on some very important topics. Nikki is in a terribly abusive home and tried hard to hide that fact from everyone in fear of being taken into social services. A lot of families are in the same situation as Olivia\u2019s family, searching for a job is hard especially right before the holidays. Flora and Ruby are dealing with the loss of their parents in their own ways. I also think the author is setting Ruby up for a diagnosis such as ADD or ADHD. There is a lot of focus on the Willets and their battle with Alzheimer\u2019s. I think this series would be a great one for a book discussion. So many different topics to cover."}, {"userName": "Alberto Lopez", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54513934-alberto-lopez", "userReview": "Had fun reading it with my girls."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Wardrip", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125613-jennifer-wardrip", "userReview": "Reviewed by Marta Morrison for TeensReadToo.comI read my first MAIN STREET title in the fall of last year and was delighted with it. I have since recommended it to many of my students. I just finished NEEDLE AND THREAD, the second of the series, and fell in love with it all over again. Flora and Ruby are two sisters who have come to live with their grandmother after their parents died in a car accident. Grandmother owns a sewing shop, which Flora loves. This story picks up a few days after the first one ends. The four girls: Flora, Ruby, Olivia (Flora's best friend who lives next door), and Nikki (the girl from the wrong side of the tracks), head off for school. They love their teachers and Ruby becomes very involved with Camden Falls by joining the community kids chorus, taking dance lessons, and getting the lead in the school play. Flora doesn't feel as connected, as she seems to miss her old life a little more than her sister. I loved the way the Grandmother would swear by using phrases that I have used such as \"All my stars!\" The story also includes many serious subjects that children of today have to face. The chapters about Nikki's family made me sad but also glad that they weren't written with a heavy hand. I so like these books that I intend to have all of them for my 5th-grade classroom and encourage all the girls to read them. Thank you, Ms. Martin, for creating a series which speaks to the children of today."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23663649-victoria", "userReview": "I liked this book very much. This book was very interesting, it had some real life drama but not to much to make you scared,it also had happy heartwarming parts that made you joyful. This book was about two girls who who moved to their grandmothers house after their mother and father passed away in a car accident. This is the second book in the series. The to sisters go through there first year in a totally new place. They all make new friends that have difficult situations going on as well and help each other every step of the way, still having fun around the Holidays, and sewing in there grandmother mins shop. It also contains some mystery because these two girls mother grew up in the same place, and had friends around there, and a mysterious lady who lives in a house and rarely ever comes out. So as you can see this would be a good book, but for a little older children because of the older content such as drug addicts, a older woman with Alzheimer's, etc. But over all this book has a wide variety of these children's lives, and is very intresting. You should defineitley read it!"}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64880196-ed", "userReview": "I really liked this book.

The characters are real, and experience the ups downs of early teens, tweens, sibling rivalry, family problems and insecurities. This is a great series with nothing that a parent would worry about, with their girls reading on their own. Heartwarming and heartwrenching at times. A lovely series to share if you're still enjoying reading time together at night. I'm enjoying it while it lasts, with my near 14yo daughter, and will sorely miss these nights when the inevitable happens and our \"good nights\" do not include reading together."}, {"userName": "BDC", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28486174-bdc", "userReview": "Excellent beginning readers series. At first the plethora of characters confused me and my daughter. But after a few chapters it was clear.
