I would consider myself fans of all three writers in this volume, but my favorite story was by Carol Finch, one of the three I've read the least books by. I admit that I enjoyed the contrast between the proper wealthy woman from back East and the mixed-heritage rough and tumble ex-Texas Ranger. I also liked the fact that they were able to see past apparently superficial divides between them to the good-hearted people beneath disparate exteriors. I felt the ending was a bit too abrupt, but I would give this one four stars for its feel good vibe and readability, and also having a great lead pair. Also brownie points for the hero's awesome dog named Dog!The Jillian Hart story was good and I enjoyed it. It took me a while to get into it, and when I did, what the heroine does nearly killed the book for me. I really dislike when you have a character who supposedly falls in love with someone and then completely disses them because of what someone has said or what their bad reputation indicated. It didn't read true to me. I hurt for the hero in that case, and I found him a lot more sympathetic than the heroine. Hart writes very good heroes. Generally I like her heroines, but I didn't understand the heroine's reactions and motivations, so that spoiled the story for me with this one. I can only give it story three stars.Cheryl St. John writes a compelling and heartwarming story for this volume. The main couple are stranded together in the heroine's father's well-equipped Pullman during a snow storm, along with two orphaned kids. To complicate matters, armed bandits are after a payload that the US Marshal hero is trying to protect. For a short story, this has a nice dose of western action that make this reader happy. Readers who enjoy survival stories will appreciate this. I also liked the 'don't judge a book by the cover' theme of this novel. The heroine comes from a rich family and she seems like she might be spoiled and unlikable, but she shows a generous, some resourcefulness that definitely helps in their situation, a good heart and a strong spirit from the beginning. I liked seeing her bond with the children, and I liked the way their romance unfolded. This one was also four stars, although I liked the Carol Finch story more.Overall, a good Christmas short story historical romance collection with good western stories and good writing. It was actually a quick read once I was able to focus my attention on the stories. I did the math and this comes out to be about a 3.8/5.0 star rating but it's Christmas, so I will round it up to four stars."}, {"userName": "Lynn Spencer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11488136-lynn-spencer", "userReview": "I\u2019m usually not an anthology junkie, but when Christmas rolls around, I just can\u2019t get enough Christmas stories. As a result, I have quite a stash of holiday anthologies. For this month\u2019s TBR, I pulled out the 2011 Snowflakes and Stetsons collection from Harlequin. While there wasn\u2019t any one story that hit it out of the park, I more or less liked everything I read here so I\u2019ll definitely count this book as one for the win column.Do you like your holiday tales with a heavy helping of angst? The Cowboy\u2019s Christmas Miracle by Jillian Hart delivers more than a little bit in that department, and frankly, Hart writes a good emotional, \u201ctug at the heartstrings\u201d sort of story. In this tale, Caleb McGraw has just finished serving his sentence for a crime of which he was wrongfully(of course) convicted and he is passing through his old Montana town to see the former sweetheart he left behind.When Caleb learns his former love has died, he prepares to move on, but then he learns that he has a child. When he finds the child living with a local widow, he can\u2019t drift out of town as quickly as planned. What ensues is as much a story of parental love as romantic love. Caleb\u2019s desire to get to know his son is well-written and I enjoyed seeing this side of Caleb just as much as I liked watching him fall in love with Caroline. Caleb has a lot to overcome if he\u2019s ever going to rebuild his life and while some parts of this story were just a little too pat, I found it moving, sweet, and perfect for the season.

Anthologies with a Christmas theme are my favorite books to buy for holiday reading because they\u2019re easier to read in small snippets of time. That said, this review was written to meet our TBR Challenge date before I finish the third story, so I\u2019ll come back and revise this when I\u2019m finished.Why was this in Dorine\u2019s TBR? I purchased this book in print because the cover wouldn\u2019t stop calling me. Isn\u2019t it cute? I like Jillian Hart and Cheryl St. John for historical westerns, and as a bonus I\u2019d get to try new-to-me author Carol Finch. But, I only read Christmas stories in December and January, so this one sat on my shelf way too long. Wendy\u2019s challenge got me moving to finally read this one.The first novella I read was THE COWBOY\u2019S CHRISTMAS MIRACLE by Jillian Hart, which has a very unusual premise. The hero served time and comes back to find the woman he had hoped to spend his life with prior to his imprisonment. Nothing is as he expects because he discovers the woman died and he has a son who is now living with another woman in charge of his care.I love the setting of Montana territory but I didn\u2019t find Caroline Dreyer\u2019s circumstances as believable as Caleb McGraw\u2019s. That she would willingly move to a remote place with her best friend\u2019s son, then speak to a stranger as easily as she does, wasn\u2019t convincing. Caroline seems very na\u00efve for a woman making it on her own.All three characters have suffered a great loss, but their stories didn\u2019t affect me emotionally as I felt they should. They should have tugged at my heart but I wasn\u2019t invested in their backstory enough for that to happen.The foundation for this novella was intriguing but it carried on too long without enough subplot to support it. Caleb McGraw\u2019s story is heartbreaking but he\u2019s too ashamed of his background once the reader understands what happened to him. He\u2019s kind and respectable but I wanted him to have more confidence and pride.A good idea but the characters and their day-to-day lives didn\u2019t appeal to me enough. The writing is good but the story needed more oomph. I\u2019d rate this novella a 3.5 as I will remember the ingenuity of creating a hero who has just been released from prison, but the rest of the story didn\u2019t captivate.I skipped to Cheryl St. John\u2019s novella next, instead of reading in order so that I could meet my deadline. I have never read Carol Finch before, so I am intrigued. Anthologies are one way I find new-to-me authors, so I\u2019ll go back to her story and update this review when finished.As always, Cheryl St. John\u2019s story A MAGICAL GIFT AT CHRISTMAS captured my attention from the first page. I love the \u201cstranded in the wilderness\u201d idea, anyways, but this one has several unusual twists.First, the hero is a marshal in charge of guarding some payroll gold on a train in Colorado. When he suspects a robbery, he detaches the last few cars to hide the gold from the gang. He instructs the engineer to keep going and not stop when the gang tries to overtake them.The Pullman car attached to the mail car just happens to have a rich, railroad baron\u2019s daughter in it and they become stranded in a snow storm together. If that\u2019s not enough to contend with, they discover two orphans who hid themselves in the mail car, so now they have gold, robbers and the children to worry about as well as their growing attraction to one another.Jonah and Meredith seem like a most unlikely couple because of her family\u2019s wealth and her obvious upbringing, but Meredith isn\u2019t your normal socialite. She shoots guns and isn\u2019t afraid to use them when the going gets tough. She\u2019s feminine, yet tough as nails \u2013 not afraid to stand up to Jonah when he\u2019s being ridiculous. He soon learns Meredith is not predictable and just the kind of woman he can relate to, even though he knows she\u2019s about to be engaged when they reach Denver.Cheryl St. John\u2019s novella is entertaining, unusual and has some great survival tactics, something I love to read about. The only part that wasn\u2019t perfect for me was the quick, few sentence resolution. I think an epilogue would have been a nice touch because I wanted to know more. Even with that small disappointment, I\u2019d rate this a 4.5 because it\u2019s exciting, unusual and interesting, keeping me glued to the pages from beginning to end.For me, the SNOWFLAKES AND STETSONS book purchase was worth the money because of the unusual premise of the two stories I read so far. The cover drew me in with the cute child on the cover and both stories contained children who drove the plots forward. Both are also very sweet romances for those who prefer that type of story.Review by Dorine, courtesy of The Zest Quest.

I loved Caroline, Thomas, and Caleb, and cared about what happened to them. Anger engulfed me when I found out the reason Caleb was falsely arrested, and enjoyed the way the author worked things out in the end. A very nice, realistic, feel-good story.Christmas at Cahill Chrossing by Carol Finch - (1 star) This story had too much bad language and was way too sensual for my taste. If it had been a full length book I would not have finished it. The writing style was ok, but not much happened after an unfortunate accident during a blizzard sets up the plot. Also, the personality of the main character, Rosa, changes way to much, and too quickly, to be believable.A Magical Gift at Christmas by Cheryl St. John - (5 stars) Meredith Abbot is not your usual society maiden. She isn't sure exactly what is important to her yet, but slowly discovers that during the course of the story. There is not a dull moment in this one; it has stowaways, train robbers, and, of course, a romantic dilemma.

This was my first Christmas read of the year and it was a sweet read! I read it early, during a time when I needed some comfort, but be sure to know that this book will be read again this Holiday season. \"The Cowboy's Christmas Miracle\" By Jillian HartAfter serving seven years in a Territory prison for a crime he did not commit, Caleb McGraw goes home only to find out that his fiance is dead and that he has a son. That news takes him to Moose, Montana where his six year old son Thomas now lives with the widow Caroline Dreyer where he prevents a robbery and is invited to stay at least until Christmas. Caroline who lost her husband and child, and Thomas who lost his mother are both cheered by Caleb's company, and soon these three unhappy people are making the best of the season. As Caroline and Caleb's attraction grows and she figures out that he is indeed Thomas' father, they grow closer together and share their pain and hopes for the future. But what will happen when Caroline finds out that Caleb is an ex convict and the reason behind his imprisonment?The Cowboy's Christmas Miracle by Jillian Heart is a lovely, heartwarming holiday story about three people who experience deep loses in their lives and find a second chance at that illusive happiness. Although things happen a bit quickly for these two people and Caroline needs a push to see what is clearly in front of her eyes, I love that Caleb deservedly finds a place where he's respected for the wonderful man he truly is, and happiness with Thomas and Caroline.\"Christmas at Cahill Crossing\" by Carol Finch Beautiful Rosalie Greer is caught in a blizzard on her way to town from a secret Santa shopping trip. It's dark and wolves have her surrounded when Lucas Burnett and his dog, Dog, find her buried under a pile of snow. Lucas takes her to his ranch where as an outcast of society he keeps to himself. He's bitter about the fact that he was a Texas Ranger and helped settle the area, but because of his mixed blood he is not socially acceptable to the townspeople. However, Rosalie is not everybody. She is a respected business owner and despite an initial misunderstanding likes gorgeous Lucas. After he saves her life, she's determined to involve him in the town's events for Christmas and hopefully in her life.In Christmas at Cahill, I loved both Rosalie's spunky attitude and the fact that Lucas couldn't resist her. Carol Finch brings the whole town into this story, making the Christmas holidays come alive for the reader and including a bit of action by using Lucas' Texas Ranger past. Finch uses sexual tension to build this romance, and later on passion heats up the holiday season in this novella.\"A Magical Gift At Christmas\" by Cheryl St. JohnU.S. Marshal Jonah Cavanaugh and three other Marshals are on the train to Denver, guarding a gold shipment from a gang of train robbers. Desperate circumstances push Jonah to make the fateful decision to disconnect the mail car from the rest of the train, and let the rest of the train go on to Denver. He decides to guard the car, let the other Marshals deal with the gang and wait for reinforcements. Jonah's plans, however, are complicated when he first finds Meredith Abbott riding her father's Pullman car and on her way to Denver for Christmas, and later finds Hayden and Jillian, two stowaway children, in the baggage section of the car. Jonah, Meredith and the children find themselves in the middle of a blizzard, waiting for a gang of thieves to attack, and hoping for rescue. While the situation is stressful, it also helps to pull them together and as the warmth of the holidays, love and giving make way into their hearts both Meredith and Jonah realize what's really important in life.I really enjoyed A Magical Gift At Christmas. Meredith and Jonah are strong characters, and the children make great secondary characters in this novella. The train robbery, shootouts and action give this story a real western flavor, yet the wonderful heartwarming, family atmosphere that St. John is known for is right there to enjoy. The Christmas theme is well represented in the middle of all the action, and a romance that begins with admiration and respect as its base, has a sweet, sweet ending."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1871221-judy", "userReview": "Snowflakes and Stetsons The Cowboy's Christmas Miracle By Jillian HartCaleb McGraw has just been released from the Territory prison.

Don't expect shots of shirtless, muscled cowboys on the cover or hot love scenes.(except in one story) The cowboys in these stories generate a different kind of heat of the heartwarming variety. The homey, sweet cover conveys the tone of the stories in this anthology.THE COWBOY'S CHRISTMAS MIRACLE: by Jillian HartJillian Hart crafts a heart warming tale of forgiveness and redemption in this short story. Caleb McGraw fits the role of weary loner returning to town after a long absence. He looks up the woman he was involved with before he was hauled off to prison (for a crime he didn't commit) and discovers she is dead and left a son. Seeking out the kindly widow Caroline Dreyer that took in the boy, Caleb stumbles into a horse robbery in progress and thwarts it ably. Caroline is grateful and Caleb becomes a Shane-like hero to Thomas. One look at Thomas and Caleb knows he is his son. The rest of the story is heartwarming and I will admit to getting a lump in my throat at the loneliness and longing of Caleb. The story is sweet and the emotion real, all ends on a happy Christmas note.3.5 out of 5 Heat Level 1CHRISTMAS AT CAHILL CROSSING: by Carol FinchThis short story is the only one in the trilogy with any kind of love scene and Carol Finch certainly delivers. Lucas Burnett is a mixed bag of a cowboy, his Indian/White/Mexican heritage makes him an outcast and a loner. Imagine his surprise to find a woman caught in a blizzard, a very beautiful woman, Rosalie Greer. Rosalie awakens to find a 6'3 golden skinned handsome hunk as her rescuer. The attraction between the two is immediate and incendiary, but the obstacles seem insurmountable as Rosalie is from a well to-do rich family and Lucas is hardly husband material, at least in his mind. A cute Christmas sub-plot rounds out this solid short story, the hero and heroine generated lots of heat and you are pulling for them all the way.3.5 out of 5 Heat Level 3A MAGICAL GIFT AT CHRISTMAS by Cheryl St. JohnI kept thinking of a young, good looking John Wayne while reading this short story. U.S. Marshal Jonah Cavanaugh is on a train guarding a gold shipment. Under threat of attack, he separates a few of the cars from the rest of train, he finds a woman the sole occupant of the private car. Meredith Abbott is a rich beauty, daughter to a railway magnate. Jonah did not count on having a woman in this mess. Throw a couple of children stowaways into the mix and Jonah has his work cut out for him. The four share some heartwarming moments alone in the luxury car while a storm swirls outside, making their own Christmas. However when the Bloom gang shows up to rob the gold, all hell break loose. Cheryl describes the action scenes wonderfully. What does Meredith do, return to her stuffy fiance, or take life by the horns and chose the loner hunk of Marshal?

But Caleb worries that his imprisonment will ultimately tear him, Caroline, and his son apart.In Christmas at Cahill Crossing by Finch, Rosalie Greer is trying to bring presents to town when she gets caught in a snowstorm. Lucky for her, Lucas Burnett finds and gets her to safety. Rosalie is drawn to Lucas and determined to bring him out of his shell. Lucas prefers to keep to himself, but he finds himself wanting to spend more and more time with Rosalie.And in A Magical Gift at Christmas by St. John,U.S. Marshal Jonah Cavanaugh is charged with keeping a shipment of payroll gold safe from some outlaws. But his job becomes more complicated when he becomes stranded with Meredith Abbott and two children who have stowed away on board the train. Meredith is used to a life of comfort, but she finds herself falling in love with the rugged marshal, and the children steal her heart as well.I enjoy westerns and anthologies, and this book seemed like it would be a fun read, which it was. Plus, I hadn't read any of the authors before, and it was a way to sample three authors at once.St. John's story was my favorite, as it had the most action in it, as Jonah, Meredith, and the children band together to take on the train robbers. Finch's story had a memorable character in Rosalie, who is a sort of secret Santa to her town. I didn't enjoy Hart's story quite as much, but that was probably because Caleb and Caroline both have such tragic pasts.

All three had Christmas themes and showed the spirit of Christmas hopes during the troubling times each faced.The first, The Cowboy\u2019s Christmas Miracle, is a story of hope and forgiveness as Caleb McGraw faces the consequences of his past. Even though he was not guilty of the crime he was imprisoned for, he cannot face the guilt and fess up to the beautiful Caroline. Once she finds out his past, all hopes seems to dwindle that there could ever be a future between them.The second story, Christmas at Cahill Crossing, was a great story with secret Santas and two independent people who both can\u2019t seem to put the past behind them to move forward. Although the blurp says that Lucas has a frozen heart, Rosalie isn\u2019t far behind and it will take sharing a Christmas between them to thaw either.In the third story, A Magical Gift at Christmas, we find two people from very different walks of life thrown together in order to survive a band of thieves. It will take courage and determination on both of them to make it through the ordeal. With their lives on the line, will anything change between them in the long run?All three stories were great Christmas stories filled with all things Christmas: Faith, Hope, and Trust.
