She is at the heart of Wisdom. The title is appropriate - for she is growing in it herself. Wisdom seemed to me to be a bit deeper than the past three books - more introspective, with more character growth than any other in the series. It is clear that Alice has left her teen years behind and is ready to embark on a young woman's life. Gone is the angsty feeling that defined her at moments in past novels - instead she is developing a better sense of self - seeking out her place in the world. Making sense of things and making tough choices that reflect a surprising maturity. Alice's reflection on her eternity is an eye opener - for all the teen girls who would love to be a vampire (at least in the romantic vampire type tales) here's one that is and gets confronted with the knowledge that it's pretty much a forever thing - this is really grounding. What are you gonna do when whatever it is will need to sustain you through many lifetimes? Mind boggling - and something I don't think Alice really saw coming too clearly. In fact second thoughts are the flavor of the day for her in Wisdom - on more than one level. The rest of the gang is here as well - Ezra is still my favorite. I can't say I'm too fond of Jack or he and Alice's ongoing relationship - I am on Team Peter all the way. For as much as Alice grows in Wisdom Jack stays the same - I've a notion that is by design and fate. I can't shake the feeling Alice will outgrow him soon - if the next novel picks up where this one lets off. However it is clear that there is a lot of reflection by her and she makes her choices with full thought and knowledge. More secondary characters get screen time here and they are very enjoyable. The plot is more personal as it center's around the death of one of the characters - and the aftermath of that. The action scenes were very well written and absorbing. There was even one scene where I let out a little shout I was so SHOCKED--did not see that coming!Fabulous! Clearly a writer to watch. While the series retains its YA flavor it can be enjoyed by those of any age. I, for one, am so grateful to amazon for introducing the Kindle so we could all get to know some great new authors at prices that don't break the bank. Ms. Hocking is one of them!"}, {"userName": "Samantha Young", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4394330-samantha-young", "userReview": "The fourth novel in the My Blood Approves series begins with the tragic death of Alice's best friend, Jane: it looks like there is a serial killer on the loose in downtown Minneapolis. But is it of the human variety or something with teeth?Wisdom is another fantastic read. The best thing about it is how much Alice has grown, how strong and independent she's become. She's pretty kickass actually. I love a heroine who knows how to handle herself.Plot-wise, there are lots of truths revealed; lots of heartbreak as Mae has to deal with her out-of-control vampire child; lots of action, as Alice hunts down the person who murdered Jane; lots of romantic ups and downs - but well-handled, nothing annoying, all well-written and surprising real for a paranormal romance.All and all this is the best of the series and it could even be the end. But it is an open ending and I really hope Hocking decides to write more about Alice...especially as her chosen career at the end of the novel would suggest plenty of action-packed sequels.Five HUGE Stars!"}, {"userName": "Noelyn Marie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3654667-noelyn-marie", "userReview": "I'll start by saying that I'm thrilled that the use of \"come/go with\" has decreased significantly in this book, although I'll probably continue to cringe each time I hear that phrase from now until the end of time.Other than that...Good thing I loved both the Twilight and Vampire Academy Series, because I've gotten a huge dose of both with this series. I guess those who will understand this review the most would be the ones who have read the Twilight and VA series. Those of you who know of Bella, Rose, Moroi, Dhampirs, Immortal Children, newborns, and groups who want to keep the vampire world under wraps will understand the frustrations I have. Bloodwhores and dhampirs (oops, I mean dhampyrs)? Really? I realize bloodwhores were brought in earlier in the series, but I dismissed that at first because there's really no other term for what those people are. But now our main character turns out to be a dhampyr? Who's also a kick-butt fighter? Seriously? So now our super-self-controlled newborn vampire whose blood, while human, drew vampires to her in an unnatural way turns out to be the half-breed (aka, dhampyr) child of an absent vampire father and unloving mother and is also an amazing fighter. I won't even get into the profession Alice decides to go into (Buffy, anyone?). Oh, and there's an out of control child vampire who threatens to expose the vampire world to humans and Alice's family is being threatened by the people who want to make sure that doesn't happen. Because they know the child is with them. I'm sure soon a pack of werewolves will join the party, too. Again, in general, the story is good, but there is an excess of unoriginality going on that's often distracting. I've made it through 4 of the books so far, so I'll read the last one when it comes out. I mentioned in one of my last reviews that it seems like Hocking is very concerned with getting books out ASAP without really taking a lot of time with them. I think the lack of originality exhibited in this series especially backs that up. The reason all of these things make a good story is because they already worked well in two other very successful series. Let me be clear. I absolutely do NOT think Hocking said \"I like those ideas. Let me mush them together and make my own story.\" However, some half-hearted editing by herself and an objective source would probably have brought these things to the surface for her, in addition to fixing the massive amounts of grammatical errors. She even says on her blog that she is not a very good editor, so I would think that right there would tell her she needs an outside source reviewing her work before publication.I'd recommend this book to those of you who have started the series, but I can't say I'd recommend the series to anyone who hasn't yet started it. Although, I will say, once you get past being annoyed by all of the similarities and grammatical mistakes, they become almost entertaining."}, {"userName": "Texas Book Lover", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483461-texas-book-lover", "userReview": "4.25 stars. I picked up this series after reading about how good it was for only $0.99 on the Amazon discussion boards (where I typically get all my advice for new series). I started reading them the week before Flutter was released and I was not disappointed! I have really enjoyed following the whole gang through their adventures and transformations. Another girl in my office and I were anxiously awaiting Wisdom's release and both started it about the same time. I was slightly ahead of her and we were comparing % read on our kindle's all day yesterday. I will have to say there were a few things we did figure out, like who Lief was. Although there were a couple of other scenes I did not see coming that made me stop and get mad at my book. We were also taking bets as to who Alice would pick in the end...I won!!!Overall, I was pleased with the way the series ended...but I can see where there could be additional books of Alice's adventures to come!"}, {"userName": "Courtney Wells", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19433724-courtney-wells", "userReview": "* dramatic gasp *I finally found you on Kindle!

The story was also very predictable as were the other three books. It was extremely easy to figure out who Lief was, and even the killer was fairly easy to spot, although the author did try to throw us off.In this book, we have all the character once again united, and as much as I like Jack, there are times when he really irritates me and I think Alice would be much better off with Peter. Peter's love for Alice seems more solid - less wavering, while Jack sometimes acts too childish in his manners and attitude toward her especially when he gets made about something. He also makes rash decisions with little to no thought before doing and saying things. It is too bad that Alice feels she loves Jack more than Peter because I still feel Peter is the right match for her. Peter is much more grounded as a person and as a vampire, and he would hurt Alice less often than Jack does.On the author's website, she states there is to be a fifth book and I'm wondering if it will be of a better quality than the first four, and exactly here she plans on taking Alice in the next book.

With that said I finished all four available books in five days, and I have created a review that wraps them all into one. Alice Bonham is a quick witted and desperately honest character that readers will love to follow. She keeps that story entertaining yet light enough so that it offers an effortless read. When paired up with the mysterious Jack the story will take on mystery and danger that will offer readers even more. As the mystery begins to bloom into a paranormal romance and suspense that will captivate and intrigue. The My Blood Approves series carries an strong since of lust and control throughout every book. Action packed and packed full of emotion this series offers a thrill ride that will promise to leave you wanting more. As the love triangle forms for Jack, Alice and Peter; readers will find themselves choosing side for the future of the series. Every book carries the intensity of the first, and builds the story taking it to new heights. I am excited to find that there is more to come and the final book will be releasing in 2012. I look forward to seeing what\u2019s to come. After the turmoil that transpired over the third and fourth book; I was happy to see that things may be slightly releasing for the start of the fifth book. While I do love Jack\u2019s character I am finding myself in a personal struggle with Alice\u2019s choice. I love the development of her interests for the future, and can not wait to see what comes of her decision as a Hunter. This is a series worth every minute of reading, and the anxiety that it creates. I can not wait to get my hands on that next and final book. While I hate to see the story come to a close it seems that it is wrapping up nicely."}, {"userName": "Jayme", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3575768-jayme", "userReview": "Okay, so in a matter of two days I have read all four (currently released) books from the My Blood Approves series. I cannot say enough good things about these books. why? I'm not too sure I can put my finger on it. They draw me in, get me hooked, I want to keep reading to find out what happens, who loves who, who hates who, etc. The characters are all liable and you get to know each of them really well. Hard to do in a book. usually you get a good grasp on one or two characters and then the rest get glossed over. This didn't happen. You also get connected to each character in different ways. I love the triangle between Alice, Jack and Peter. At first I was all gun-hoe about her and Jack, then after a few books into it I had started second-guessing myself and who I (personally) thought she should/would be with. And Hocking is such a good writer that she can pull you both ways at once. The story itself is not all that new (kinda Twilight in it's general feel with the supernatural love triangle, human girl loved by vamp 'family' who is uber hip and rich and cool etc..) BUT it's done in a new way/with a twist. So It doesn't get old or boring to read at all. Her spin on Vamps and even Lycans is new in her own right and is interesting to read about. All in all I highly recommended this series of books to any one who loves vampires/romance/sci fy/fantasy genres. There were a few spelling errors/grammatical errors in every book in the Kindle version, but I got over it. I will be getting the 5th book as soon as it comes out, and I hope there will be more after that.

It has a lot more action, a lot more character development, and a lot less flip flopping of emotions, which drove me nuts in the third book. Alice finally chooses who she wants to be with, and though I was rooting for a different outcome, I'm content that she made the right decision. I feel like everything she felt for the other characters was less forced down my throat than in previous books, and I think that made the final outcome more real and believable. There's a lot more action in this book, and I love that Alice finally finds some direction in her life, where as before she seemed so slothful and lost that I kind of despised her. But she, and all the characters grew throughout the book, and I think that's integral to a great story. And the writing has drastically improved. Unfortunately it's still marred by typos and poor formatting in the kindle edition, but since Ms. Hocking is an independent writer, I'm willing to overlook imperfections that don't detract terribly from the story."}, {"userName": "Shealynn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2513112-shealynn", "userReview": "Loved loved loved!!!!"}, {"userName": "Adriana", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4476326-adriana", "userReview": "Loved it still want her to end up with the bad boy though LOL cannot wait till the next one....."}, {"userName": "kimberlee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26602561-kimberlee", "userReview": "This series consistently improved as time went on and I really wound up enjoying it. Typically I'd say this series gets four stars, but I am giving it five stars for two reasons that really made me appreciate this author because what she did is rare unfortunately. Reason One: The love story. Alice picked a man and stuck with it. Sure she had a few missteps but she made an appropriate choice and picked the man that was good for her. She didn't pick the dangerous or brooding guy. She picked the nice one with the good laugh and who loved her for everything she was, faults included. I thought it might go the other way, but in the end she did it. She picked the good guy, and that should happen so much more in books.Reason Two: Alice is kick-ass. She had a lot of growing up to do, but she learned and she grew. She sorted her shit out and she did it without the help of a man (he supported her but he didn't choose her path and even when he freaked out she didn't beg and cry. She put him in his place). She was strong and fierce and just made me happy. I just really appreciated the growth and the fact that the author let her be her own person separate from her relationship. Overall as a series it was pretty good, I had a fun time reading it. But I'd recommend it wholeheartedly for the reasons above. There needs to be more books that balance a great love story with the ability for the characters to be their own people outside of it. Kudos to Ms. Hocking for that."}, {"userName": "Michelle  novelsontherun", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3677193-michelle-novelsontherun", "userReview": "RATING 5 OUT OF 5 STARS!!!! Amanda takes us outback to the Northern Territory, Australia and back, in 'Wisdom'. In hindsight, maybe not outback enough.Daisy is exactly what Ezra predicted. Poor Bobby is Daisy's target. Everytime Daisy lined Bobby up, I was laughing, maybe I shouldn't have been but it would have been funny to watch. Kinda a pretty little 'chucky doll' launching itself at Bobby. Mae isn't seeing straight and Alice has had enough of the little monster. Leif is hanging around more and Olivia is training Alice to harness her strength and learn some skills. Alice is going all Nancy Drew and leaving Jack out of the picture. I love Alice's new sidekick. He has really grown on me, lol!!! Jacks taste in car was rather cool. Amanda brings back all the memories with that one. I can't help feeling when reading this series that Jack may be older in human years than Peter, but he acts younger, hence Lego, X-Box games etc. Jack loves Alice , he will fight for her but is not a fighter. Jack doesn't show interest in training. Peter and Jack's 18th birthday gifts to Alice were soo different. Jack is there for Alice whenever she needs him which is getting less and less as her strength supercedes his, making her less a target and more a badass fighter. Alice's character grows , Jacks doesn't in their relationship. Peter , I have a soft spot for him as he too easily would give his life up for Alice he still feels some connection that he can't ignore even though the bond has broken. Alice will do whatever she can to save both Peter and Jack when they need it but can only choose one lover. I can't help feeling Peter should be 'the one'. He is soo raw and honest with his feelings towards Alice. 'Wisdom' has action, stolen kisses, smexi moments, fight scenes, boundaries are pushed with trust, sad moments, funny moments and times where you will just go OMG!!! Lots of storyline is packed into these pages. Amanda never skips a beat with her storytelling. FAVE QUOTES: \"Yeah.\" Jack's smile grew broader. \"Does it come with a flux capacitator? \" Milo asked. \"No.\" Jack looked at him like he was an idiot. \"You're gonna wear a cape?\" Violet laughed, raising an eyebrow. \"Oh yeah. Combat training is so gonna work for you.\" \"I'll take it off to fight,\" Bobby said defensively. \"I just wanna survey Gotham with my cape flapping in the wind.\" \"Wait. \" Bobby pushed in between Violet and me to get closer to the glass. \"Vigilantes? You mean like Batman?\" \"What is with this kid and Batman!\" Violet groaned. \"He's only the most awesome thing ever, \" Bobby shot back, glaring at her. \"Oh my god!\" Bobby pointed at him. \"That dude is supposed to be a vampire hunter, and he's got on a fricking swatch! There is no way these guys are for real!\" \"Wait, wait,\" Bobby interrupted, snapping his fingers. \" I've heard that before. That's like what Blade is, right? Wesley Snipes was a vampire hunter, but he was like super strong and badass from being a half -breed.\" He glanced back at Milo. \"You weren't like that when you were human, were you?\" \"No , I got my ass kicked all the time,\" Milo grimaced at the memory of his human self. \"So how come they weren't all like Blade?\"Bobby asked, turning back to Ezra. \"Because, it's a movie, Bobby,\" I said dryly."}, {"userName": "\u274b Sylvia \u274b", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6830002-sylvia", "userReview": "Currently on chapter 13, wow mind blowing already!so i'm not going to make a review at the moment, this is more of a remind to me to come back and look at once i'm finished the book. these are just some of my guessesLief is Alice dad (which would explain a lot! way there is a draw to her to other vampires, why her blood tastes so good and why as a human she had such a connection to Peter)I'd hate for this to be true but my guess is that Jack killed Jane. I just have a funny feeling in my gut and I really really hope I'm wrong because I am NOT team Peter!those are my predictions so farNow that I've finished, here are some of my thoughts :Dwell I'm just gonna tell you this, I loved this book so much that i finished it within a day! I'm drained now, I need to rest up for the next book to come out! so much happened in this book, so much death it was to be expected though but I still cried. the last chapter had me holding my breath and then on the verge of tears! I was so scared to turn the page but I just had to finish the book today! This is a heart stopping, thrill ride a minute book that you'll end up reading like me in one day, so make sure you have a full day where you can just relax and read coz this book was epic!!!!! the characters have grown so much from book 1 to book 4, they've matured in so many was and they truly have grown as a family in this book, I'm so excited to see the love for Jack and Alice has grown in this book, but they do have their fair share of ups and downs, I won't give away if they end up together, that's for you to read. But I'm happy right now with the outcome and hope this path of theirs stays the same way for the next book. I can't wait for Alice's new career path in the next book, it will be super fun to watch as she becomes the best vampire she can be!(Feb 11/12) I today still haven't found a book that matches this one, I love this series very much! I think what draws me to this series is the main character goes for the other guy, which you don't see very much. And I'm all for the underdog. With every book I read I find I want the main character who's trapped in a love triangle to go for the \"other guy\" when clearly I know already she's going to go for the leading male. but finally I have found the perfect book for me! Even though Peter is the leading male in this series Alice is still drawn to Jack! Who in my opinion is \"the other guy\", and I love that Jack has feelings! I know it might make him seem weak to others when he breaks down and cries but to me it just humanizes him and makes me like his character even more!  I know in the first couple of books my heart would race when Alice and Peter were together, not because I wanted them together but because in my mind I was thinking about Jack and how hurt he'd feel, and that's when I knew I found my perfect book!"}, {"userName": "Lily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5245651-lily", "userReview": "Rese\u00f1a publicada en: http://eldesvandelosuenos.blogspot.co...\u00bfQu\u00e9 m\u00e1s puedo decir del cuarto libro de una saga que no me convenci\u00f3 desde el principio? Pues la verdad es que pocas cosas nuevas, as\u00ed que intentar\u00e9 ser breve y concisa.Este me ha parecido, con diferencia, la peor entrega de la saga y la clave de ello es que, en mi opini\u00f3n, la escritora ha perdido el norte de la trama. Durante todo el libro (ojo, que aguante tengo que lo termin\u00e9) ten\u00eda la sensaci\u00f3n de no saber muy bien qu\u00e9 estaba leyendo ni por qu\u00e9, de que los constantes giros argumentales eran producto de una autora con ganas de estirar el chicle pero sin saber muy bien qu\u00e9 direcci\u00f3n tomar. Y tras haber acabado la novela me quedo con la idea de \"no tener muy claro de qu\u00e9 iba todo\". Ese ha sido el principal fallo de Designio y por el que la autora me ha tenido perdida durante las 300 p\u00e1ginas que dura.Pero no ha sido el \u00fanico, aunque los que voy a mencionar a continuaci\u00f3n ya los he tratado ampliamente en las rese\u00f1as de las anteriores entregas. La protagonista es un lastre para la historia y tener que leer en primera persona y ver el mundo a trav\u00e9s de sus ojos, una verdadera tortura. Mi principal problema con ella es que no la entiendo: hace y dice una cosa y la contraria con segundos de diferencia. Es criticona y juzga a todo el mundo, a pesar de que ella no es precisamente un dechado de virtud. Los di\u00e1logos tampoco es que est\u00e9n muy logrados y me han hecho poner los ojos en blanco m\u00e1s de una vez. La frivolidad, las bromas que no son graciosas y los comentarios fuera de lugar abundan en las conversaciones. Pocas de ellas se salvan y de pocas dir\u00eda que son \"normales\". Ni siquiera Jack y Peter, mis alegr\u00edas en los libros precedentes, han estado a la altura: se han desdibujado por completo y no he reconocido ni a uno ni a otro en las escenas de Designio.Adem\u00e1s, algo que he notado especialmente en esta novela, pero que tambi\u00e9n suced\u00eda en las anteriores es que para justificar una afirmaci\u00f3n/pensamiento de la protagonista, la autora mete con calzador un suceso que evidencie tal o cual ocurrencia pero sin venir muy a cuento, haciendo que parezca forzado y no natural, adem\u00e1s, en muchas casos, durante el resto de la historia se olvida de dicha caracter\u00edstica o pensamiento: me parece una t\u00e9cnica un poco vaga, poco consistente, facilona. Es una t\u00e9cnica bastante burda b\u00e1sica que pone de manifiesto los pocos recursos de la autora.En resumen, tras darle cuatro oportunidades, Amanda Hocking ha perdido una lectora. Dicen que su otra saga, Tierra de magia, est\u00e1 bastante mejor, pero para que me apetezca acercarme a ella va a tener que pasar un tiempo prudencial para que se me olvide el mal trago de esta."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3553836-laura", "userReview": "Hmmm. I liked the main plot. Poor Jane was murdered and Alice is determined to find the killer. This part of the book I liked. Mae dealing with the disastrous results of her poor choice in the previous book, turning her five-year-old great granddaughter into a vampire, not so much. I liked seeing the relationship between Alice and Jack grow and Alice start to get some direction in her life and maybe grow up a little bit. But some of the things that annoyed me in the previous books just built to the breaking point in this book. I'll start with one of the relatively minor annoyances. Everyone says \"come with.\" Like, \"Let me come with\" or \"I want to come with.\" This is totally fine for Alice, Milo, and Bobby to say. This is totally strange for the \"old\" people like Ezra, Peter, and even Jack to say. It just seems a strange piece of slang for them to pick up and sort of detracts from the idea that these people are hundreds of years old.Alice and Milo's mom. She barely ever comes up in conversation or in Alice's thoughts. If I had basically abandoned my mom, essentially also forced my brother to abandon my mom, especially since she had been abandoned by their father when they were young, I'd be feeling some major guilt, and not just occasionally when I could fit it in around my romantic angst and other hijinks. There's a major development with Alice's mom in this book, and I feel like there just wasn't enough build-up to that (spoiler: Leif, the nice lycan from the previous book, is their father, and they all finally tell Alice's mom that they're all vampires).I wasn't a fan of the whole Daisy story line to begin with, and having her be a reason that Jack is in mortal danger just seemed out of place and didn't work for me. Especially since she was already dead at that point. I kept waiting for it to turn out that somehow Daisy was the murderer because that's the only way that this storyline would seem to fit into this book.Even with these problems though, I'll be reading the next book to find out how it ends, and it's not like I want to claw my eyes out like I did while reading Twilight, so there's that.Technical notes: Smashwords .epub version. As with the last book, there are quite a few typos and errors that a good proofreading should have caught. Things like using the word \"reminder\" instead of \"remind.\" These errors annoy me.

They are getting a look at how Daisy is dealing with becoming a baby vampire. She is like all 5 years olds with temper tantrums, if she can't eat the human in the house, she throws a hissy fit. So, if she can't have the human, she decides that maybe Kola Bears might be a tasty treat. Then you turn around and she is coloring, looking cute as all get out, in her frilly dress and curly hair. Who ever said having kids was easy? After several days into the trip, Alice gets a call from Jack with some news that will shell shock you. Alice, Bobby, and Milo rush home and this is where our story begins..... In Wisdom, we get to see a lot more of Peter in this book. I actually became very fond of Peter. He finally decides not to be a pain in the rear. You see him as I imagined he would have been before he met Alice. Also in this book Alice is having a problem with relating to being alive \"forever\". With forever - how can you find a purpose? Believe it or not and I can see where that would be over whelming. I mean forever! Jack can tell that she isn't necessarily happy and that starts some trouble into the relationship. In \"Wisdom\" we see our favorite characters like Milo, Leif, and Bobby. I really enjoyed Bobby in this book. He is funny, caring, and is becoming a good friend to Alice. Also, Alice is finally going to decide if she wants Peter or Jack. So the love triangle will come to an end with a decision that only Alice can make. ** Be warned that people die in this book, yes I said people as in more than one. Also you will laugh and you will cry (or at least I did). One of my favorite funny moments is when Jack gets drunk on too much blood. ;) The last ten percent of the book has you biting your nails because so much happens toward the end.

This is 4th installment in the \"My Blood Approves\" series, but it has just as much romance, action, mystery, thrills, twists and turns at the first 3.  Almost everything about this book was enjoyable. You get to see Bobby, her brother's boyfriend, a lot more and he is so SO likable. A lot of the story takes place outside of the house, as opposed to the other books where a lot of the stuff that went down was in it. Leif is still in it which was awesome because I liked him in the 3rd book. And there is a lot of closure for pretty much everyone that needed closure.  For me, Jack started getting annoying in the third book and really in this book. Maybe it's just because I love Peter. I was totally rooting for him the second Alice saw him in the first book. I had my 'Team Peter' foam finger and jersey on the entire time I was waiting for and reading Wisdom (metaphorically speaking of course). And I loved him in this book, especially in the end. He just comes off as a really great person and character. There's a what is supposed to be a \"big twist\", but I had it figured out when we met this other certain character in the third book. Still a good twist, especially when it happens. The ending was satisfactory (except for the whole Peter thing). It pretty much answers everything, but Amanda still left it open just in case she decides to do a 5th book (which, in case there is any doubt on her part if she should or not, I vote yes). I only had a few problems with the book. The grammatical errors for one. The swearing started to get a little too pervasive for my liking. And the sex scene. Although it was small and brief (insert immature 'that's what she said' joke here) I don't like them in YA. Not that I actually like them in anything.

I would just like to write a few random thoughts on the book as well as the series. My Blood Approves is about missed opportunities: Peter refusing to come to grips with his feelings for Alice until it is too late, Mae not realizing the scope or magnitude of changing a child into a vampire, Milo ignoring the fact that eventually he will break Bobby's heart, Lief running away from his children and the woman he loves, Alice missing the opportunity to think about her decision to be with Jack while harboring feelings for Peter, Jack trying to force Alice into a life as vampire before she was ready and finally, Ezra refusing to realize that Mae's unquenchable need to be a mother would eventually have to be dealt with. With all of that being said, Wisdom reveals the outcomes of many of the missed opportunities as well as the difficult choices that have to be made in attempts to rectify the situation. In some cases it works and in others it is yet to be revealed. At the risk of upsetting other MBA fans, I believe a final book should provide an epic ending and wrap up all of the loose ends. Therefore, I cannot see how \"Swear\" (Book 5) will accomplish this task. We know Mae and Ezra are back together, Lief will be with Alice and Milo's mother, and Alice has chosen Jack. The only open issue is Peter. Who knows maybe Amanda Hocking plans to use book 5 to leave the door open for a spinoff series. I just cannot get a handle on where she could possible take book 5 and make the plot exciting, intriguing and satisfying; but, I guess that is what a good author does and we will have to wait to see if I will have egg on my face (smile).

I was almost in tears when daisy died because she was just a little girl. I t was really sad how they described it. How you could hear the ripping of her neck from her head. Also whenjack was hanging over the endge i was so trembleing. I was like, Oh my gosh jack is going to,he is going to die, he is going to die.But the thing is,is thatthey didnt have a good ending for may,erze and peter. Like i know that Alice gave peter a kiss on the cheek at the the end of the book and told him that she loved him, I think that elsie should come back from the dead or something like that should happen so peter has a happy ending too not just a depressed guy who is in a dark room with soft music and all depressed like. That was the only need to do for the next book. I know that there will be another book called swear that will come out in 2012. I hope it wont come out any later then that. Oh and i was so shocked when i found out that lief is there father and what is up with the thing about Alice and Milo being speceal i mean what does it mean if there specal? Are you on team jack or team peter. I am so team jack but sometimes i really hate him because he is either saying sorry to Alice or screaming at her or forgiving her. It is stupid how much fighting they do with each other. Other than that i love the relation ship. The love,the making out, the rescuing misions. Oh and the blood! I hte that jane had to die i mean atleast she was trying to change her self. And i could not wait for that shoping trip they were going on. One last thing. I WISH I WAS ALICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The trip is cut short when Alice learns of a recent murder of someone close to her. She is determined to find the killer and whether he/she is a human or a vampire. Alice is still torn between Jack and Peter but in a different way than before. She's in love with Jack, but with Peter, it's no longer a blood bond between them and she really enjoys being with him when she learns how caring and thoughtful he is. Now that Alice is a vampire, she starts thinking about what she wants to do with her life. Ezra gives her literature and textbooks to read and study to see if she can find anything that interests her. Alice also starts taking lessons to learn how to fight, that way she can destroy the killer. I cried while reading \"Wisdom\". It was full of twists and turns. Alice has an eternity ahead of her so she starts wondering if she made the right decision. She has to put trust in her new vampire family and also some other past characters that came back into her life. The end blew me away. It left plenty of opening for a 5th book. Out of all the possible career choices she was contemplating, she chooses that?!! (If you want to know what \"that\" is, you'll have to run over to Amazon and pick up a copy of \"Wisdom\") This is my new favorite series and I read them back to back cause I couldn't get enough.

I really enjoyed this series. I have to say, I didn't expect to enjoy them as much as I did due to the price on Amazon. I am finding hidden gems in some of these what I have recently learned are self published books. I would have to give the story a big 5 stars for sure, it was well though out and each book had me wanting more. I would say that, as an avid reader, the only drawback to these was the editing. It didn't take me out of the story, but it got to be a little annoying in this last book. I think that in this one it was more of a formatting problem than anything and that could be due to the e-reader, I don't know. There seemed to be a lot of chunks of the text that were unnecessarily indented and a pretty big chunk in the middle that was italicized that shouldn't have been, but like I said, that's all formatting stuff.As for the story, the only part that annoyed me was a section about Anna (Alice and Milo's mom), they stop to talk to her at one point and Jack is off to the side. When they walk back up to him he says something to the effect of \"So, that was your mom?\" and they agree...even though he clearly met their mom in the first book when she very shamelessly flirted with Jack. That said, I really enjoyed this series. I would like to read more, but I think that this was wrapped up pretty nicely and I was happy with how she ended this book! I like a series that makes me feel for the characters and this one definitely did that. I think that Amanda has a promising future if she keeps this up!

I mean seriously why does the auther think that Jack is right for her he's a lover and she's a fighter. I know oppisites attract but it was different when she was human but as a vampire they don't make sence. The whole book she is fighting with Jack and herself because she loves Jack but that's not enough. Sometimes love is just not enough there needs to be more and with jack there isn't. I seems that everything she does is wrong to him. I am a little bais because I like her better with Peter even more so as a vampire. I just don't feel right about her with jack especially that she is becoming a hunter. It just seems that peter would be better for her and this lifestlye. She is changing and growing up and because of that her and Jack will not \"last forever.\" She is just holding on to him because she needs something but if she would fully look into her reltionship she could see that. Maybe her and peter don't have to be together (I would love it if they would) but I would be more satified with her alone than with Jack because that feels like a cop out.

My problem is that when I start a series or trilogy or just a book with a sequel, I won't write my review until I'm like finished, because I just cannot stop reading for the like of me. I read all four of the my blood approves books in three days because I just didn't want to stop, so I've kind of been procrastinating with writing this review....So to start, I think that these books were REALLY good. I mean there were like those stupid cliche vampire book parts, but if you can get past that then you would think this was really good.Ok, so in the fourth and final book, Alice goes to Aistralia to visit Peter, Mae, and her little abomination of a child vampire, and the thing is completely out of control, but not in mae's eyes. So this book is basically about that, Jack and Alice having a little relationship trouble, a group of vampire hunters, and Jane dying and alice trying to find the killer. This book gets pretty intense.I think that this book would have sucked if it wasn't for the characters. Alice was a little bit annoying but kind of cool, but Jack was HILARIOUS, Mae seemed all sweet, Milo was adorable, Peter was sexy, and Ezra was all perfect and a little bit sexy as well.So overall, read it if you think you can get past the whole Cliche vampire crap, because the book isn't FULL of it, and it is easy to get past."}, {"userName": "Shari", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5177547-shari", "userReview": "Since I'm hearing there is a 5th book in the works, I won't say this is my favourite book of the series, but rather it's my favourite thus far :)While Alice still struggles to find her new place in the world as a newly \"born\" vampire, she takes huge leaps and bounds into finding herself in this book! She is fast becoming a strong and self-sufficient kick-ass vampire chick that no one really wants to mess with :)I still have a hint of frustration in that Alice is so torn, and not knowing that Jack is her true love, and not secure in knowing he loves her for who she is, not because of what ever biological connection they shared. But that being said, my goodness a few parts of the book, especially one near the end had me gripping my seat hoping things would still turn out all right! Jack's love and devotion for Alice is unwavering, even when he wishes it wasn't. It makes me adore him even more. I love that we get to know Peter on a more \"human\" level in this book. His compassion and insecurities are certainly prevalent. While I'm securely on team Jack, it's nice to know Peter is a sweet guy under it all. Bobbi and Milo continue to make me smile. They're adorable and entirely too much fun. Especially Bobbi who made me giggle out loud more than once. Ezra opens up a lot more as well, yet still maintains the strong silent \"oldest\" brother standard. There were a few events and revelations that I predicted, ie Leif and Daisy, but I often like being right :D While I hoped for a happier story for Daisy, it was only bound to end as it did.

I feel that Jack took advantage of Alice more than the nurture the author was implying.Whereas Peter was more caring and self sacrificing. He has shown a great deal of character growth and deserves better.Through the author comments I know Alice and Jack are meant to be, and that this goes with the theme of free will. But if she picked Peter it would still be her choice sigh.I read the Trylle Trilogy before the MBA and the fact I liked about those books is that the author didn't go with the first and obvious love interest, but rather the one that fit more.I think the author made this love triangle to complicated, and never gave Peter a fair shot. This kind of ruined the rest of the series for me. Alice had to much mixed emotions dragging the reader right along with her.

I could never see him as a serious love interest so that was unfortunate .

All the wavering back and forth between Jack and Peter stops (though I wonder about her choice given how he was portrayed in this book). The child-vampire story line was interesting, and sad. Unfortunately, Mae's character was really destroyed in this storyline. She went from being a fabulous character to someone I could just not respect at all.

Who ever said having kids was easy? After several days into the trip, Alice gets a call from Jack with some news that will shell shock you. Alice, Bobby, and Milo rush home and this is where our story begins.In Wisdom, we get to see a lot more of Peter in this book. I actually became very fond of Peter. He finally decides not to be a pain in the rear. You see him as I imagined he would have been before he met Alice. Also in this book Alice is having a problem with relating to being alive forever. With forever... how can you find a purpose? Believe it or not and I can see where that would be over whelming. I mean forever! Jack can tell that she isn't necessarily happy and that starts some trouble into the relationship.We also see our favorite characters like Milo, Leif, and Bobby. I really enjoyed Bobby in this book. He is funny, caring, and is becoming a good friend to Alice. Also, Alice is finally going to decide if she wants Peter or Jack. So the love triangle will come to an end with a decision that only Alice can make.Be warned that people die in this book, yes I said people as in more than one. Also you will laugh and you will cry (or at least I did). One of my favorite funny moments is when Jack gets drunk on too much blood. ;) The last ten percent of the book has you biting your nails because so much happens toward the end. Like the other 3 books in this series I give Wisdom 5 stars. Amanda Hocking is doing a fantastic job writing this series. It might have started out similar to some vamp books but within e next three books she makes it her own. The \"My Blood Approves\" series is one of my all time favorite series. If you just now discovered the series I highly suggest you read the first three first in order. :)"}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6190584-rachel", "userReview": "IT WAS SO GOOD!It's no secret that I have a love for the supernatural, so off course I thought I might like a series about Vampires. Amanda has entranced me with the My Blood Approves series, I love them so much. It's true that her other works are a little bit better but they should be, the My Blood Approves series was at the beginning of her career and after them she has gotten so much practice but I still love the series, characters,the plot and the writing.Wisdom is the fourth book in the series and takes place not to long after Flutter. In this one Alice is having a hard time being a vampire, she thinks she may have made a mistake. This causes a rift between her and Jack that may not be repairable. Peter and Mae are trying their best to help Daisy, the child vampire, with her uncontrollable hunger and vampire impulses. While Ezra mopes around and Milo is thriving. Milo is continuing with his education and things couldn't be better between him and his boyfriend Bobby.I think one of the main things I like about this series is the connections everyone has with each other. Nothing is perfect, people are always getting hurt but they work on their relationships with each other and they are there for each other when it really counts.Wisdom had vampires (of course), action, vampire hunters, love, death, heartbreak, murder and so much more. We got to see another intriguing side to this vampire world and it was amazing. I normally read at a slower pace but I couldn't help but blaze through this book. I have waited a long time, Amanda took her time with the final book in the series but Swear is here and I can't wait to see how it ends."}], "description": "For her eighteenth birthday, Alice Bonham takes a vacation to Australia only to have her trip cut short by an unexpected murder.
