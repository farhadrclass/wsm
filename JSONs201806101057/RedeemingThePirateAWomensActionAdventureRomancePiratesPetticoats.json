I was not dragged into this or even compelled to like Eva. I didn't feel anything for her. I was never invested. I also felt this book dragged on so much. In fact at some points I was down right bored. The love scenes were rushed and almost looked over, an afterthought by the author. I didn't care for this style. I want a romance scene to drag me in and make me feel like I am there with them. I never got there with this book. In fact it seemed like everything but the love scenes were talked to death. This of course was what I was waiting for in the book and it fell pretty flat for me.The author takes us on a journey with two of the most unlikely lovers - Eva and Drago. Drago is a pirate that is sent on a mission and Eva is a nun in training and needs his help. Yes, they are unlikely lovers but it sorta works for the book. Drago has taken two children under his wing and that made him more lovable to me. Eva was a thief turned Nun which didn't really work for me. The book had some history in it that I really enjoyed. I liked those aspects of the book. I felt like I was taken back in time with them. What I didn't like was how it was so long and drawn out. Just when you think it was the ending something else was thrown in and beat to death thus making it even longer. Overall, I thought the meat of the story was ok just not how lengthy it was.I do love this cover - it gets much cover love from me!I give this book 3 of 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016189-jeanette", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading 'Redeeming the Pirate' and made a welcome change from the usual Historical Romance books that i generally read. I cannot remember the last time that I read a book where pirates, action and adventure are concerned. I am not going to write what the story is about, as i do prefer one to read for themselves, but i do highly recommend. It is the first time that i have read a book by Chloe Flowers and i'm sure it will not be the last.My thanks to Netgalley and the Publishers. This is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Nancy Brady", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2870158-nancy-brady", "userReview": "Redemption and romance...Drago Gamponetti is a pirate...okay, a privateer, as he frequently mentions. A privateer who steals for the French, this will be his last mission, or so he believes.Enter Eva, a scarred and vulnerable thief who is a noviatiate nun-healer. Summoned to heal a sick young girl, Jacqueline, Eva meets the pirate.Clashes between the two lead to love, but is it possible to change a blackguard? To redeem a man whose soul is irredeemable? Can Eva learn to trust him? Is he trustworthy? Set during the time of Battle of New Orleans, this romance has intrigue, humor, and swashbuckling moments.Only real complaint is the over abundance of typos, missing words, wrong words, etc. An extra set of eyes during proofreading might have prevented many of them. It is hoped that the print version has been corrected as the story is otherwise decent and a great addition to the other Pirates and Petticoats series novels."}, {"userName": "Debi Samuels", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34589326-debi-samuels", "userReview": "I was hoping for a little more swashbuckling, that being said, it's based on a turbulent historical time. Think Pirates of the Caribbean meets Anna Karenina. I enjoyed this book enough, there were some surprises I didn't expect and there were times I laughed and wanted to slap someone so that's always good. It's a good time passer and well fitting for the genre, just don't expect perfect historical accuracy (though the author did a pretty good job!)."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46326854-janet", "userReview": "French Privateer, Captain Drago Gamponetti is given one final mission from his employer, the king of France: reclaim religious relics from a New Orleans cathedral and bring them back.

Worse, 60 British warships have amassed in Negril Bay, Jamaica, preparing to attack New Orleans. He must retrieve the sacred relics before the British arrive and seize the city. Novitiate nun and healer, Eva Trudeau has secrets, and hides more than her face behind the veil. The convent has been her safe haven since she crawled, beaten and bloody, to its door nine years ago.

A well written page turning book that kept me on the edge of my seat at times, there were twists & turns that captivated me from the start & I read well into the night to finish it.The characters are well drawn & very likeable.

It's revolved around the battle of New Orleans. Drago was once a pirate and now works for the king of France, but looking to branch out to work for himself. That is, if everything goes to plan. Eva is a novitiate and a healer who was rescued by the nuns when she was eight years old. Her past has left her scarred and she considers herself to be repulsive and hides behind a veil. Her aim is to become a nun. Drago has taken responsibility for his friend's twins when one of them requires medical treatment. He turns to Eva for help and on their way to retrieve fresh water, they bump into the well known white witch who delivers a prediction. It's a riddle at this point, but could she really see in the future? Eva has been given the task to go to New Orleans to warn the church of a pending theft whilst Drago is on a mission to steal these relics as his last mission for the king of France. He sees this as the perfect opportunity to obtain information about his mission and then move on to his future plans. His plan in thwarted when Eva forces him into a vow to help her. Does making a vow under duress count? The British are planning to invade New Orleans and this war could well be the distraction that Drago needs to accomplish his mission. The thing is that he is torn between his obligations to the twins, his loyalty to the king and his burgeoning love for Eva. After she was attacked on the ship, he has sworn to protect her! When her past comes to haunt her, he is even more determined, but she discovers by accident that he hasn't been completely honest with her. Can he redeem himself and regain her trust? Although lighthearted in places, this historical novel is full of danger and intrigue. The storyline is interesting, especially as some of the contents are based on real events. The romance is rather sweet and I like the way Drago sees the inner beauty of Eva instead of what most sees on the surface. All in all a brilliant read with some lovable and fun characters, and a solid plot. I was kindly issued with an eARC and the views expressed are my personal opinion."}, {"userName": "Joann Gall", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16713716-joann-gall", "userReview": "Two Thumbs UpAbsolutely my favorite book yet in the Pirates and Petticoats series. So many twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters had drawn me in right from the start. I felt all their feelings through the entire book.

Drago is tough, stubborn, dedicated and loyal. Eva is caring, determined, brave and insecure. The two start on opposite sides of an issue, and Drago uses Eva for information that helps him. But Drago has a conscious that shows up occasionally, testing his convictions, especially when it comes to Eva and the twins. The storyline progresses from a simple opposites attract to all out war. I love how Drago evolves from a pirate to an entrepreneur and Eva grows from being a scared child to being a brave adult. The book is filled with interesting history and entertaining characters. This is an amazing and captivating series that belongs on your TBR list.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Netgalley.

I found d book ok ... The start was good but too much descriptive & lengthy . the secondary characters were funny ...as per expectations it didnt work for me ..."}, {"userName": "Cindy Vallar", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50863622-cindy-vallar", "userReview": "Several days before someone pounds on the abbey door late at night, a Jamaican white witch warns Sister Eva about a darkly shadowed man carrying a sick child. When the knock comes in November 1814, Eva opens the door to Captain Gamponetti, whose menacing manner and expectations of immediate obedience frighten Eva. But she is a healer and if her assumption is correct, the young girl suffers from contact with the deadly Manchineel tree. Saving her requires Eva to first bring down the fever. This necessitates a journey, with the daunting captain and her patient\u2019s brother, to nearby caves where the cool pools of water will bring down the girl\u2019s temperature.Once a pirate and now French privateer, Drago Viteri Gamponetti is a condemned man \u2013 not by the law, but by his own heinous deeds. Although Jacqueline and Julian are not his children, they are his responsibility until he can return the twins to his friend and their uncle. First, he must rendezvous with the trader who will purchase his cargo of sugarcane and then he must meet with three French agents. He hopes this will be his last mission for King Louis before he will finally be permitted to pursue a more legitimate line of work.The witch appears on the road to the caves and warns Drago that the time to choose approaches. If he makes the wrong choice, he will die. His only hope is a beacon of light, but salvation will come only after he betrays an ally, breaks a vow, and helps an enemy. She also slips Eva herbs to make tea to help cure Jacqueline and to make Drago do Eva\u2019s bidding. Before she can inquire into the specific herbs, the witch vanishes.Eva is reticent to give the tea to Drago, but he has a ship and she needs transportation to New Orleans as soon as possible. A dying Frenchman seeking absolution has revealed that the French king has sent agents to steal sacred relics from the cathedral. She is determined to prevent this, even at the risk of her own life. Setting foot in the city could bring her face-to-face with the man who tried to kill her ten years ago for losing a precious map.After Drago drinks the tea, a compromising comedy of errors ensues and he pledges to take Sister Eva to New Orleans. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem until only two of the three French agents meet with him and he must not only transport them to New Orleans but also assist in the theft of the relics. His initial reaction is to refuse, but the king has sent his trusted assassin to either bring him the relics or kill Drago and his agents. Since his soul is already doomed, Drago thinks it may be safer to betray Sister Eva rather than his king.When he delivers his cargo to the trader, Drago discovers a fleet of British warships in the harbor. He also learns the reason for their gathering and how they intend to use the sugarcane. Since he still has a modicum of conscience, he vows to prevent France\u2019s enemy from utilizing it in their planned invasion of the United States. Nor can he endanger Sister Eva or the twins by taking them with him to New Orleans. In the coming battle 2,000 able-bodied, but untrained, men will defend the city against more than 10,000 battle-hardened, veteran soldiers. What he doesn\u2019t factor into this decision are the twins, who refuse to be left behind. Determined to return to their family and defend their country, Jacqueline and Justin stow away on Drago\u2019s ship; when Sister Eva cannot find them in the abbey, she and an older nun go in search of them. Which puts all four aboard the vessel when Drago sets sail. By the time he discovers their presence, it\u2019s too late to put them ashore. They are in a race against the British invasion force to reach New Orleans first.Redeeming the Pirate is a captivating retelling of Beauty and the Beast. Part of the Pirates and Petticoats series, this historical romance is a poignant love story, a gut-wrenching depiction of war, and a tale of redemption. From that first knock on the abbey door to the aftermath of the Battle of New Orleans, the characters draw you into the depths and breadths of this story so we experience all their joys and pains. They make us laugh or cry, depending on how they interpret the predicaments in which they find themselves. Most authors focus on the primary battlefield (Chalmette) and final confrontation in this final major conflict of the War of 1812. While Flowers covers all the skirmishes that comprise the Battle of New Orleans, she focuses on two aspects often overlooked in or omitted from other novels. One concerns the fascines (ladders) the British intended to use to scale and overrun American defenses. While Drago\u2019s plan to infiltrate the British encampment and destroy those fascines seems a bit na\u00efve for someone as knowledgeable, astute, and jaded as Drago, Flowers presents an interesting and plausible reason as to why the enemy failed to implement this part of their plan. She also incorporates the British attempt to seize the American position on the West Bank of the Mississippi and turn those guns on Jackson\u2019s forces at Chalmette, which would have led to a far different ending to the war. These portrayals permit her to vividly show us what it might have been like for anyone taken prisoner by the British and how sometimes the intervention of a divine source often makes the difference between success and failure.Redeeming the Pirate is one of the best romances and historical novels I\u2019ve read this year and I highly recommend it. It is also worth noting that Flowers will donate 15% of her book sales to the National Breast Cancer Foundation."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45535274-katie", "userReview": "Redeeming the PirateBy Chloe Flowers4 starsReviewed on behalf of 3 Degrees of Fiction Book BlogThis book wasn\u2019t quite what I was expecting given the title of the book however I did enjoy it!
