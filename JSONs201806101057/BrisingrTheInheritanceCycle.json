Amazing!"}, {"userName": "Swankivy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy", "userReview": "An extremely long-winded \"full\" review by me for this book is on my site here.Everyone's been asking me to review the third book in this series, so here I go. In case you didn't notice, it took me over a thousand days to force myself to tackle it, but I decided my Labor Day weekend needed to be ruined by something. My review is pretty much a ramble about everything I disliked about this book, but I'll try to keep it relatively short. The author still has basic storytelling problems. The main one I keep noticing is that he is trying to work description or exposition into the action more, but it still reads like he's stopping the \"movie,\" ZOOMING IN ON EVERYTHING, and then pushing PLAY again when he's done. We nearly always get an extremely detailed description of every weapon, every person, every room, and every setting the characters encounter, and the adjectives used aren't connected to actions or attitudes. Or if it's exposition, maybe we'll have someone cast a spell, and then the action pauses while we endure two paragraphs of narration about other caveats to the spell that could have been applied but aren't useful here, and what might happen if it fails, and all kinds of trivia about other magics that are like this one--none of which end up being important in the scene. He's still failing to filter these observations through the minds of his characters, which dooms the narrative voice because it takes us OUT of the moment every single time. He has also made some poor choices with apparently unintentionally sexist phrases and disturbing attitudes toward women, most notably by \"telling\" that Arya is brave and independent and capable but \"showing\" that she is not any of these things because she needs to be rescued AGAIN. There were so many other people Eragon could have had to rescue from imminent death, and yet again Paolini chose Arya as the damsel in distress. She holds her own and later saves his ass once too, but framing women like this suggests that the strong ones are the exception to the rule. And sometimes, Roran talks like a rapist. It's really uncomfortable: Katrina: \"My, you are bold, dear sir. Most bold indeed. I'm not sure I should be alone with you, for fear you might take liberties with me.\"Roran:\"Liberties, eh? Well, since you already consider me a scoundrel, I might as well enjoy some of these liberties.\"Katrina:\"You're a hard man to argue with, Roran Stronghammer.\" So, take note, dudes. If a girl says she's worried being alone with you might lead to you pressuring her, you might as well actually do it since she thinks that way about you anyway. Such coquettish banter, this. Add to that the fact that Saphira's narration is really obnoxious and recoil in horror at some of the untidy retcons Paolini tried to force into the story, and you have a very good reason to believe this fellow has not learned from experience. Bad Narration: Stylistically, narration is pretty terrible in this book. The similes and metaphors are especially galling, and I noticed that a disturbing number of his comparisons involved geological themes. I mean everything was hard \"as diamonds\" or heavy \"as lead\" or bright \"as gold.\" No one can just be \"distinguished\"; she's \"the most distinguished, like an emerald resting on a bed of brown autumn leaves.\" Someone should tell Paolini we don't need everything compared to something else in order to understand it. Even a monster's blood, which happens to be blue-green, is described as \"not unlike the verdigris that forms on aged copper.\" Coming across \"Her tears appeared like rivers of silvered glass\" just made me groan. And how about \"Red as a ruby dipped in blood, red as iron hot to forge, red as a burning ember of hate and anger. . . .\" So . . . was it red? As red as HATE and stuff? Don't forget to dip red things in other red things so you can go off on how red they are! And let's not forget \"A flock of starlings darted across the afternoon sky, like fish through the ocean.\" 'Cause \"a group of animals moved through their habitat, like another group of animals moving through their habitat\" really helps us see it better? And the biggest problem with it is it's not just distracting and unnecessary; sometimes they place an alternate image in your mind and draw your attention AWAY from the object or situation he is describing. The unnecessary description is especially pronounced when it comes to describing weapons. Paolini devotes an inordinate amount of time to his descriptions of swords and other tools. One of the shorter descriptions was as follows: \"[A] bizarre implement: a single-edged weapon, two and a half feet long, with a full tang, scale grips, a vestigial crossguard, and a broad, flat blade that widened and was scalloped near the end, a shape reminiscent of a dragon wing.\" I found one sword description--for a sword the protagonist only used for a couple chapters--at a mind-blowing two hundred words, and don't even get me started on the chapter where Eragon actually makes a sword that matters. Twelve pages of excruciating detail explain how exactly he made the sword, and it reads like an instruction manual. (Because Paolini freely admits he was fascinated with a certain Japanese swordmaking book at the time. Gee, you can't tell.) It's like if you just wanted to watch a crime thriller and twenty minutes of the footage involved an autopsy detailing exactly how the victim died. Some of the descriptions actually truly do not make sense, such as the description of Arya's voice as \"Her low, rich voice contained hints of rustling pine needles and gurgling brooks and music played on reed pipes.\" Can you imagine that? Someone's VOICE having all those things in it? Considering the gurgling, I think Arya may need a doctor. And let's not forget our old friend the unnecessary speech tags.\"But how could you prove that?\" objected Eragon. ::sigh:: I shouldn't have to say it again, but if the WORDS THEMSELVES are an apology, an agreement, or an objection, you DO NOT NEED TO IDENTIFY THEM AS SUCH with your speech tags? ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO THE WORD \"SAID,\" MY DEAR BOY? (\"Yes, yes he is,\" said the exasperated author of this essay.) And my favorite, of course, was when I encountered a single sentence that was 307 words long. Also known as \"this is where the editor fell asleep.\" The narration described all the dwarves who were sitting around a table, and the sentence contained 9 semicolons, 28 commas, and 26 descriptive adjectives. When the final dwarf was described as \"she of the nut-brown skin marred only by a thin, crescent-shaped scar high upon her left cheekbone, she of the satin-bright hair bound underneath a silver helm wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf's head, she of the vermilion dress and the necklace of flashing emeralds set in squares of gold carved with lines of arcane runes\" . . . I really thought I was going to shoot myself. Bad Dialogue: Two big problems. One: everyone--no matter their education--talks as though they are royalty, and it is uncomfortably unnatural. Roran, the illiterate farm boy, says \"You dote upon her words as if each one were a diamond, and your gaze lingers upon her as if you were starving and she a grand feast arrayed an inch beyond your reach.\" You'd never guess his job is beating people to death with a hammer. Two: Other people's reaction is to praise their verbal abilities. This happens like six different times in the book, and I am convinced it is an attempted Jedi mind trick on Paolini's part. A character says something awkwardly phrased, long-winded, and overly ornate, and another character tells him how poetic he is or expresses amazement and surprise at his eloquence. Is he just trying to convince us that's so? (The \"cursing,\" which happens a couple times when characters who are very angry spew out a stream of obscenities, is especially inappropriate. They all sound like they've been taking insult lessons from the French Taunter.) And I probably don't have to say why a fantasy novel that actually contains the phrase \"Die, puny human!\" should be punished and reminded to go on the paper. Predictable Plot Elements: This book is riddled with \"revelations\" that are written as if they will be a surprise to the reader, but I feel almost insulted when the narration suggests I didn't know. Take for instance monsters that are left for dead and actually aren't--wow, never saw that coming! Or a girl being revealed as being pregnant after her \"secret\" was already referred to multiple times, including her acting weird whenever having children is mentioned. How about when a character mysteriously referring to his \"hearts\" instead of his \"heart\" turns out to--oh my gosh--actually be foreshadowing? Yeah. It's really insulting. Nonsensical, Contrived, or Contradictory Plot Elements: The most obvious and most drastically awful problem with this book is that the magic system continues to be incoherent and continues to get worse. People cast spells that go against the rules of spellcasting, or in a couple cases contradict everything Paolini has said. (Especially one scene where Eragon saves himself from an attack without using conscious thought or magic words; he has no time to compose a spell either mentally or verbally, and so he just \"rewove the fabric of the world into a pattern more pleasing to him.\" This is established as NOT how magic works.) He also gets a ridiculous magic sword that bursts into flames for no reason every time he says the magic word for \"fire,\" and seems shocked that fire was produced even though he didn't try to cast a spell. Guess what? Saying \"fire\" in the Ancient Language WHILE THINKING IT WAS A CURSE WORD and NOT KNOWING HE EVEN HAD MAGIC was how Eragon accidentally cast his first spell in the first book. Why is it so unbelievable now? Eragon also randomly guesses--on the first try--another character's true name, by which he can control him with magic. This wasn't a person he knew really well (Arya suggests Eragon doesn't even know her well enough to guess her true name, but he figured out the true name of his cousin's fianc\u00e9e's dad), and there's no precedent for this random true name discovering in the book, before or since. In fact, when Eragon's worried that Galbatorix might guess HIS true name, Arya completely dismisses it as impossible. Huh? Eragon denies Roran's request to be made more powerful through magic because he would \"lose whatever strength or speed\" that Roran would gain from it. This isn't how magic works in his story either. When he cursed Elva to grow up too fast, he didn't literally lose years. When he heals people he doesn't lose his own health. Admit it, Eragon. You just want an excuse to be the most badass in the story. It seems like Paolini's magic system only makes sense in weird little pockets of logic that wouldn't actually add up to a comprehensive set of physical laws. And you know why he does this? Because he constructs his physical laws around what he wants to happen instead of having things happen that reflect the physical laws. There is also a consistent, disturbing trend for Eragon and Saphira to threaten people, barely suppress their own violent intent, and behave like tyrants. Saphira snorts fire at someone who said she couldn't have mead (after which he changes his mind right quick, and it's written as funny), and she attacks a tree spirit when it doesn't answer her fast enough. Even worse, Eragon tortures a blind man and banishes him (then gets emo about what HE went through having to do that), ignores a man's mortally ill wife to go drinking with his buddies until he's reminded again to heal her, and seriously considers taking the dwarf council hostage if they don't vote how he wants them to. It's horrible, and yet the narration treats Eragon as though he is a gleaming hero. A hole: Paolini writes in English. The language of the humans is never named, but we just understand that it's the common language. Its not having its own name doesn't fit in with anything established in the story, and he keeps calling it \"Eragon's own tongue.\" C'mon Paolini. Name it. You name everything else, including swords, and you name your main characters three or four times depending on who's talking to them. I bet you named your buttcheeks. You can name the language. Arya tracks Eragon down at one point, and when he asks how she found him, she explains that \"A Rider does not walk unnoticed in this world, Eragon. Those who have the ears to hear and the eyes to see can interpret the signs easily enough.\" She goes on for a while and it's clear he basically leaves a track in the air. I hereby dub this the Scent of Rider Farts. Which is going to bite Paolini in the ass really hard, if pretty much anyone can track him due to his being unable to walk unnoticed in the world. Perhaps his Protagonist Powers will counter this tremendous disadvantage? I also have a problem with the magically enhanced soldiers the evil king sends at Eragon and his allies. They've been modified to not feel pain. This somehow makes them harder to kill, which makes no sense. They only die when they're hacked apart or beheaded, like zombies, but if the only reason they keep advancing when they're mortally wounded is that they don't feel or fear pain, it seems ridiculous that mortal injuries don't still make them go into shock or bleed to death. Painless soldiers actually shouldn't be harder to kill. The aforementioned retcons mostly involved changing Eragon's known father from Morzan to Brom. In order to make Brom fit as his father, an entire chapter devoted to unpacking misconceptions and exposing lies he'd been told had to be inserted, wrapped up by a conveniently \"recorded\" memory Saphira had kept for Eragon in which Brom confessed to being his father. There were so many holes that had to be plugged and so many queries that ended in \"Well Brom never told anyone why he did this or that\" that I felt very strongly that this was an attempted twist that fell as flat as M. Night Shyamalan's movies starting with Signs. I imagine Paolini just got tired of being told he was writing Star Wars in Middle-Earth and decided to undo Luke Skywalker being Darth Vader's son. And as a good thing about the book, I chuckled when Eragon asked if there was anything he could do to appease the dwarf clan that hates him and Orik replied, \"You could die.\" Yes, you could, Eragon. Why don't you get on that? I must say this was a terribly difficult book for me to read and I honestly do not think Christopher Paolini is improving as a writer. There were perhaps three places in the book that I was interested in what was going to happen, and there were MANY places where I honestly would have just put the book down and not thought of it again if I weren't trying to review it critically. It's frustrating, because Paolini has determination and imagination, but his incredibly debilitating flaws are his inability to write character and his absolutely tone-deaf prose (especially since he decorates it after the fact with gaudy adjectives resembling fake versions of the gemstones he's always shoving into his similes). If he would learn to write people as if they were something other than plot devices and learn to stop writing narration as if he is an overenthusiastic performer, he might improve. Until he does so--until he realizes he ought to--he will continue to be a lucky kid who grew up to be a below average writer . . . an artist whose art is only admired by those who don't know better."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260468-lauren", "userReview": "So, I was a little disappointed with this third installment of Paolini's Inheritance \"Cycle\" now - since he changed the game and made this a 4 book series instead of 3, as it was originally intended.The story was good and what I have come to expect from this series. But honestly, it did not have to be 748 pages long. I understand the author's desire to flesh out his characters, but the way that he kept going back and forth between the different characters I found annoying. The descriptions of the fights did not have to be as gory or detailed as he made them, nor as long as he made them. I had several guesses going throughout the book about how the plot would unfold and I ended up getting it right - though the character I thought was being set up to die did not. There are also points of the book where I can clearly see familiar plot points that I have seen in other books or series, like Star Wars or LOTR.I also found Paolini's waxing on religion and philosophy through his main character annoying - it's as if he is trying to make this series more poignant than it is should be - because after all, it is just a good fantasy tale at its core and I feel like he should just stick to those roots.I will be interested to see how Paolini wraps this complex story up. He has woven a lot of moving parts together and they are all pretty complex and I wonder how the climatic battle between good and evil will finally play out. I just hope I won't have to wade through another 800 some pages to get to the end."}, {"userName": "Trina (Between Chapters)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9323164-trina-between-chapters", "userReview": "If you want a story with awesome dragons and magic, this is a series to check out!

It was released on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to conclude the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex to conclude in one book, because the single book would be close to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009. Brisingr focuses on the story of Eragon and his dragon Saphira as they continue their quest to overthrow the corrupt ruler of the Empire, Galbatorix. Eragon is one of the last remaining Dragon Riders, a group that governed the fictional nation of Alaga\u00ebsia, where the series takes place.

(END SPOILER)There were a two things that propelled me through the book. 1. what happens with Murtagh. 2. Do Arya & Eragon get together. Yet again, I feel as if things just sort of meandered about, story lines just got smooshed and pushed together. Also, Eragon was so whiny. It reminded me of one of the Harry Potter books (maybe OOTP) Where Harry's character just got on my nerves. Eragon was on my nerves throughout the book. I felt like he was sort of having himself a little pity party. Maybe this is all because Paolini is so young and started these books so young. The first book was sort of carefree for me. It was fun and exciting. The second began the bogged down descriptive nature of what has apparently become Paolini's adult style. It's very disappointing.Perhaps if the book lost about a third of it's over descriptive text it would have been a much better, and tidier read. I rarely give up a series, but I think for the next one I'll just ask someone how it ends, instead of trying to force myself through what is likely to be another 500 pages at minimum."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Honeycutt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241968-rebecca-honeycutt", "userReview": "Is it just me, or is this series on a serious downward spiral? Eragon was uninventive but entertaining; Eldest was a bit of slog, but pulled through in the end; Brisingr, however, just left me exhuasted and annoyed. At least half of this novel could have be edited out, and as with the previous two books, Paolini seems more interested in showing off his vocabulary (both English and invented) and in delivering lengthy, detailed battle scenes than in telling a compelling story. Oh, and....SPOILER BELOW....******.....what's up with the Eldunari? Horcruxes much? The whole series has been a cup of Tolkein, a dollop of McCaffrey, a dash of Lackey, and now we're adding a teaspoon of Rowling.

We all know Paolini killed his trilogy by turning it into a \"cycle\" but making us read through another 784 pages after his horrific second book, Eldest, was grounds for banishment to the Empire's dungeons.The book basically had no plot, just a bunch of diversions to keep you reading thinking something big was going to happen. Did I really have to read an entire chapter on how Eragon made his sword while an elf was controlling his body? Or all that super-cheesy heart-of-hearts rambling? And what of Katrina's father? Who cares??? It's a recap wherein no new characters or real plotlines emerge. Rather, the author spends his time further developing his characters and setting us up for the big finale - the showdown between Eragon and Galbatorix, and possibly something with Roran - like he'll become a Rider or hero of some sort due to his supernatural strength, and something with old Murtagh and Thorn - who just won't die. All of this will no doubt occur after we've read 600 more pages of recap in the final book of the cycle.Still, I have to keep reading because I know by the time two years passes and the final book comes out I'll have forgotten how lame two out of three of these books were and will pick it up and read the ending and hopefully be shocked to learn that Galbatorix wins and all that is good in the world is gone because that is the only way Paolini can surprise us at this point."}, {"userName": "Colleen Houck", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1163228-colleen-houck", "userReview": "I was glad that Chris Paolini ended up spliting this book in two because I didn't want Eragon's adventure to finish.

I've spent two weeks trying to get through this 700-page snoozefest and I'm still completely uninterested in what happens next. I can muster more enthusiasm for the third season of 'Rock of Love.'To be fair, I've never been ecstatic about the Inheritance trilogy (although I think there's going to be one more book because 700 pages just wasn't long enough). Eragon was a pleasant enough, if unoriginal, story, made more impressive because of Paolini's young age. (Heck, when I was 15, I was busy puffing my bangs and writing love poems to NKOTB. Writing best-selling novels was out of the question!) Eldest was a little better, which I attributed to the author maturing.I had high hopes for Brisingr. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. It's so tedious to read - overly detailed, an overwhelming sense of self importance, no real plot. Plus, it's so heavy, it can be used as a door stop. The author is in desperate need of an editor. This book could've easily been pared down to a breezy 500 pages."}, {"userName": "Zachhg", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1643186-zachhg", "userReview": "Zach Highley-GergelMrs. EbarviaWorld Literature Honors10-21-08 Online Book Review Brisingr\tFire; is the definition of the title of the novel in the ancient language. Brisingr is the title and was written by Christopher Paolini. He has written Eragon(the first book of the Inheritance cycle), Eldest(the second), and Brisingr(the third). The protagonist is Eragon who and with his dragon Saphira. The antagonist of the novel is the forces of Galbatorix and Galbatorix himself. Eragon\u2019s goal with the help of the Varden, which is the rebel forces against Galbatorix, is to free Alagaesia from his tyranny. Alagaesia is the world which Eragon lives in.\tThe novel had many interesting things; one of the things being the ancient language. The ancient language is a language that can be used as a regular talk or a way to summon magic. Also the dragons talk through their minds like many magicians can. Eragon is trying to kill Galbatorix, but before he can get to him he needs to become a skilled magician and fighter. He learns how to be this through Oromis and Glaedr. Oromis is a secret rider hidden from Galbatorix, and Glaedr is his dragon. The novel is exiting and vivid. \tThe novel was good other than one boring bit. When Eragon is trying to unite the remaining people of Alaesia who aren\u2019t under Galbatorix\u2019s control he goes to the dwarves to try and speed up an election. This is an election between the dwarves\u2019 leaders. It is quite boring because it is talking about politics and many dwarfish things that are not explained. Also there is quite a bit of un-needed talking.\tDespite its little weakness, the novel is an enjoyable piece to read. Brisingr is filled with action around every corner. It also contains some humor, and the ancient language is quite interesting to understand. There are also many hidden surprises with the book like: who Eragon\u2019s father and brother is, and what happens at his cousins wedding. If you like an exciting, fast paced, and magical story you will like Brisingr."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1508944-aaron", "userReview": "Finally, this series has given me a novel that I have enjoyed every part of. I consider it the darkest of the three novels, as Eragon realizes what a dire situation he has placed himself in, and the slim chance that he might succeed in his mission to free the citizens from the tyrannical rule of King Galbatorix. This book finally brings its characters and its plot back down to Earth, and although the novel still thrives off fantasy, and now possesses a sense of reality to it. This book has given me new hope that the series can save itself with its finally which will came out in who knows when. But, this is definitely the best book of the entire series thus far."}, {"userName": "Kenchiin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41280039-kenchiin", "userReview": "By far my favorite of the tetralogy. Paolini allows his characters to grow within the story in a very crafted yet natural way.There is still plenty of irrelevant verbiage, but at this point I already got used to it."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1562092-adam", "userReview": "No offense to those of you who liked this book. I had a really, really hard time getting through this one. I thought the first book of the series was neat cause it was written by a kid, but sadly, Paolini's story telling ability hasn't grown an iota. Why did Paolini have to make this a four book series. He easily could have taken the 35 pages of actual plot from this book and prepended it to the beginning of the next book. The pace of this book was excruciating. Does there really have to be three chapters devoted to a wedding? I can barely tolerate sitting through a wedding for a person I care about. Does Eragon really need to depart on a 150 page adventure to influence who would become the next dwarf king? Couldn't the dwarfs just have sent a memo. It's not like anyone over the age of three didn't already know who it was going to be.It was painful to watch Eragon spend three quarters of the book whining that he doesn't have a good weapon when we all know where he has to go to get a new one. It was also painful to see Paolini twice find a lame excuse to split up Eragon and Saphira. Do we really need those tearful reunion scenes every time they don't see each other for more than a few days time?Anyways, I'm rambling and I apologize. There were a couple redeeming parts of the book. I generally liked most of Roran's adventures. And I liked the part when I finished and could pick up another book. Too bad I'm way to big of a sucker not to buy the fourth book. Worst of all, when the next book comes out, I'll probably have forgotten how bad this one was and I'll read it again. Maybe it will be better the second time."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009204-cindy", "userReview": "Wow. Before anyone comments, I was a HUGE fan of the first book. Second book I thought was alright. This book sucked so bad. Between the terrible writing and the grammar and the fact that it was 800 pages of how long Paolini can babble about nothing and still keep an following. The reason for the 4th book was this was for character development? What character development, the characters are more one sided then ever. You can almost predict what they will do before they do it because they are just that lame. As for plot, it was just a bunch of go here go here. And then Eragon babbling in his mind about what will happen, could happen, might have, must happen. I really wanted this to go somewhere, sadly it didn't. A waste of time, energy and really money. I have to say this, Eragon is the poorest choice for a dragon rider. He can't make a choice for himself and he has no spine to stand up to anyone, so he just does what everyone wants him to. It's a shame that the king who might be a good character is only refered to throughout the book. Maybe he can be the redeeming character in the 4th book. There are so many sentances that start with \"And\" \"Then\" and \"But\" that they appear on every page in the book. That's just poor writing. It felt like a 3 year old telling me a story that they are excited about. Was there even an editor on this book? Or were they afraid that his teen ego would be hurt by the fact that obviously he never took English lessons in middle school or high school. That's the only thing I can think of, is that someone teaching him forgot to teach him grammar! Lastly, remember you can write a 3000 page book and it could suck or you can write a 150 page book people liked. Maybe Paolini should remember that because these marathon books he isn't very good at and is definately not learning any respect from me."}, {"userName": "Charlotte May", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14002983-charlotte-may", "userReview": "Whilst I've been going through the Inheritance Series I must admit I've struggled and have thought about putting them down on more than one occasion.However as I've pushed myself through i'm so glad that I did - the world that Paolini has created is absolutely incredible, I feel transported to a world of dragons, magic and ancient lore, its astounding to think that Paolini wrote Eragon when he was only 15!I have been blown away by the depth of the storylines, descriptions of the scenery and the intricate characters - I cant wait to read the final installment, though I feel i'll need to read them all again as there is probably so much information I didn't completely take in!"}, {"userName": "Phoenix2", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6542967-phoenix2", "userReview": "I can't believe I haven't added and reviewed this one yet!!

Eragon's slow transformation from simple yet inquisitive farmboy to the last free Dragon Rider is a joy to read, and I relished every insignificant detail. Roran, who shocked me with his strength and fortitude in Eldest, continues on his path to becoming a brilliant military strategist and leader, all the while leaving his heart with his beloved Katrina. Murtagh... ah, Murtagh, my favorite tragic character doesn't get much time in the story (though a much larger part than in Eldest), but each line, each syllable is deliberate; my heart aches when he realizes there may be hope after all to release him from the binding magic placed upon him by Galbatorix. I am anxious to continue the relationship between Eragon and Arya; it started out as an akward sort of crush, leading to a dismissal by Arya, but I believe she has a newfound comraderie when it pertains to Eragon, especially toward the end of Brisingr, when Arya realizes what a great team she and Eragon make together. Will Eragon ever see his feelings for Arya reciprocated? Can Roran keep up this madman's pace with the Varden's troops before something tragic befalls him? Will Murtagh turn against the king, and how? Who will be the last Dragon Rider? And who is that strange hermit with the long beard living amongst elven ruins? It will be a long 2 years before I wil get my answers or hear Angela's biting comments, but well worth the wait. Thank you, Mr. Paolini, for leaving the book on such a beautiful note; one of subdued reverence, of the battles that lay before us, of hope, and of the inevitability of the end - maybe not the end of Eragon and his companions, but of our involvement in their lives."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69733-shane", "userReview": "After waiting 100 years for book 3, I expected a lot more. The meat of this book could have been condensed into about 100 pages. Very little plot development occurred. There was some character development, but not enough to warrant 750 pages. I probably wouldn't be so critical, but the video he posted stating why it took so long to get to book 3 said that he didn't feel he could do it in one book. Bad news. I bet that if you read book 1, book 2, and 3 selected chapters of book 3, you could go straight to book 4 without any problems.

This book is terrible! The first one was forgiven for it's rambling irrelevancies due to it's imaginative world and logical magic. This one has no excuses. First off, it's about as entertaining as watching a clock's hour hand tick. Second, approximately two things happen in the entire book that are even important! Each event can go beyond being summed up in a chapter or two. This was riddled with rambling text, inconsistencies, and fluff. A wonderful example of it's dull droning takes place while Eragon is eating fruit with his teacher. As the two are staring at each other for a good few paragraphs we get a lovely description of a scintillating hummingbird that floats out of the trees and licks up a bit of fruit juice.
