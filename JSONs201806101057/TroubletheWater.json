There is hardship and despicable treatment and loss. Two people whose lives have not been easy will change each other\u2019s lives. This is a love story, but I gradually found it to be more . It\u2019s about the pre-war south, a view of the white upper class society vs the plight of their slaves, about the lengths that people who stood for humanity and freedom would go. Abby Milton is sent to stay with her father\u2019s old friend Douglas Elling. She is reeling from things that happened to her in England when her family faced poverty and he is withdrawn and grieving awful losses. She learns of his involvement in the abolitionist movement and sees him in a different light. He discovers things about her life in England and vows to protect her. As we suspect, they begin to heal each other by their presence. I was disappointed that there was not more of the abolitionist activity. It was when characters came to life with their passion for helping others that the intensity of the story was deepened. The antics of the Cunningham sisters made this feel a little melodramatic, but in spite of this , I found I was captivated by the story. Oh and I loved the Epilogue!I received an advanced copy of this book from Spark Press through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Deanne Patterson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34916386-deanne-patterson", "userReview": "1840's Charleston, South Carolina. This is a new to me publisher,SparkPress and I must say I am very impressed with this historical fiction book they have published . I am open to reading more by this publisher. The cover is the book is very eye catching. Abigail Milton (Abby) is from a middle class British family but when finances become an issue she is sent to America to live off the charity of their old friend, Douglas Elling. Very unsure of herself and not sure what to do with her time Abby is miserable. The widower who is take take care of her is a grumpy man who has lost his daughter and wife and wants nothing to do with her. Staying out of his way is the preferred thing for her. Life starts to open up for Abby as she gets used to her new living situation an starts to become more comfortable. Unable to help but overhear her benefactor making plans for the escape of a slave. Does she really know, Douglas? He sure doesn't seem to be the man she thought the was. The author has really done her research as this book is rich in details about abolitionist,Charleston\u2019s aristocratic planter class, American slavery, and the Underground Railroad all taking place 20 years before the Civil War.

Early on, I thought I would not be able to read it. I thought it was too heavy of a subject matter, but it didn't end up dwelling on any aspect for too long. The story was told from multiple characters\u2019 perspectives and takes place primarily in Charleston, South Carolina. I would say there were three main characters. Douglas, a successful businessman in shipping, Abby, his temporary ward, and Clover, a pregnant slave. It is a romance and historical fiction and is trying to do too much within the page space allotted.Douglas has dealings in the Underground Railroad. Abby is from Liverpool sent by her family because of her unmanageable temperament, which is explained and understandable, but her family doesn\u2019t understand and thinks a change of scene is in order. Clover is a slave in the nearby Cunningham household. Abby is in her presence maybe twice. and I don\u2019t believe Douglas ever was so there was little connection between the Clover and the other MCs. I felt the characterization of the Cunningham family was off. They seemed like a caricature of a quintessential Southern family, and their role was to show the Southern way of life with slaves, throwing in facts and statistics (that were suspect at times) into conversation as way to show the author did the research rather than true to character.The romance was nice enough but not very compelling. Not enough time spent on the development of the relationship to be very satisfying. The writing is clean and strong, but it needed something more to standout. Not a bad read. Just not a great one either.*I received a copy of this from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kate Olson", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-kate-olson", "userReview": "Thanks to BookSparks for the free review copy of this book as a part of #SRC2018!I read this entire book in one day, and thoroughly enjoyed this historical romance set in 1840's Charleston, SC.

This is totally outside my comfort zone, but I found myself turning the pages and racing to the end like I would any thriller. Loved the characters and the omnipresent narration.

I love the vivid descriptions of the times, the landscape and colorful cast of characters. The Genres for this novel are Historical Fiction, Fiction, with an essence of Romantic Adventure. The timeline for the story is about twenty years before the Civil War, taking place in Charleston, and England. The story centers around the time of American Slavery, the early Abolitionist movement and the Underground Railroad.The author describes her characters as complicated and complex. Douglas Elling is a wealthy British, serious, and aloof widower, now residing in Charleston. His wife and young daughter perished in a fire that is suspect as retribution against Douglas for his beliefs. Douglas lives in a mansion with lots of space.Abigail Milton is seventeen years old, living in England,and her once middle class parents are now in poverty. Her parents send Abigal to live at Douglas\u2019 house and work with a governess . Abigail\u2019s father is friends with Douglas. The parents are hoping that Abigal will benefit, and they can recover their losses.Both Abigail and Douglas come from England, and aren\u2019t familiar with slavery. The wealthy neighbors have slaves and don\u2019t treat them well. The wealthy in Charleston are having parties and balls. Abigail has left secrets and betrayals behind and is having difficulty showing trust. She is having a difficult time adjusting to the new way of life. The author has a wonderful way of describing the homes and fashion of the times.There are twists and turns and some tense dangerous events. There is deception and lies. In Charleston, for those people who feel that there should be freedom, there can be devastating consequences. I recommend this wonderful novel for those readers who appreciate Historical Fiction."}, {"userName": "Gaele", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9146116-gaele", "userReview": "Surprisingly fast paced despite the very plot-heavy themes with multiple challenges, growth and an overlay of tension that keeps readers flipping pages, this was a unique presentation that brought together historic events, challenges and choices in ways not before seen. Abigail Milton is a British girl, born to the middle class in the 1800\u2019s. Her family has encountered difficulties and debts, and since she is \u2018of that age\u2019 it is time to prevail on a family friend in Charleston to take her on. She is put aboard a ship destined for the city, to live with wealthy family friend, Douglas Ettling and his family. But things have changed and Douglas is now widowed, and wants little to do with \u2018raising\u2019 this girl \u2013 instead handing her off to the care of a governess to \u2018finish\u2019 her education and prepare her for a life in Charleston society. Much to Abby\u2019s delight, she\u2019s not forced into interactions with the gruff and disagreeable Douglas, but instead discovering this new place, the ways of society there and becoming more settled and curious about her situation. Soon, Abby overhears Douglas and another man discussing a slave\u2019s impending escape and their aiding in that process. This brings instant questions to Abby, as she discovers that her benefactor is, in fact, an abolitionist and far from \u2018accepting\u2019 the status quo of all \u2018good Southern landowners\u2019, he is quietly working against that system, or as quietly as one can after knowing his wife and young daughter\u2019s death in a fire were a result of his beliefs. Soon the story changes as Abby understands the gravity of her situation and that her initial impressions of Douglas were wrong \u2013 as she looks at the issues around slavey, Planter Class, abolition, the outdated and outmoded (if very current) beliefs about the \u2018humanity\u2019 of the slaves, and their rights, as well as the early incarnations of the Underground Railroad, Douglas\u2019 support of those looking for freedom, and her own relationship with Douglas framed by her new understanding of him and the dangers that seem to be ever-present in her new home. Friedland brings all the research clearly forward, allowing readers to experience both public and private faces of society at that time, revealing dangers to those who aren\u2019t supportive of slavery as well as those running from bondage with the help of many who are willing to risk lives, reputations and lands to aid them on the way to freedom. A fast paved and atmospheric read that brings readers into the decades just before the Civil War when the abolitionists in the south have started to act, rather than simply believe, in the rightness of their cause.

However, The Invention of Wings changed that for me and set me on the path to be less hesitant about reading others. So when Jacqueline Friedland's debut came along, I was ready for it. While I was initially intimidated by Invention, I was able to dive right in to Trouble the Water. This isn't just a story about slavery. There are parts involving the Underground Railroad, but I learned new things about it while also being entertained. The main piece of this novel is a love story. Of course, that also involves a lot of drama and heartache. I liked that there were narrative shifts, so that I could hear the different character perspectives throughout the story. I genuinely cared about the characters (the good ones, at least) and their well-being. While the novel started off a bit slow for me, it picked up steam early on and kept going from there. I found myself unable to stop turning the pages after a while! I just wish Abby had fit into the epilogue somehow. I would love to see what happened with her several years down the road. Overall, it is extremely well-written for a debut novel.

She did a fantastic job of creating very real characters in the historical setting of Charleston, SC, twenty years before the civil war. Abigail was born into the middle class in England but when her family fell on hard times they decided to send her to Charleston to live with an old friend, Douglas. Because she was only 17, Douglas hired a governess to teach her in both book learning and how to be a proper young lady in Charleston society. Abigail quickly learns that Douglas is a disheveled very unlikable man who hadn't gotten over the death of his wife and daughters two years earlier. She kept her distance from him until she overheard a conversation about how he was helping a slave escape to the north. Once she learned that they had the same opinion about slavery, their relationship improved and the reader begins to hope for happiness for both of them.The author did considerable research on the South before the Civil War with her information about slavery, the Underground Railroad and the Abolitionists.

It brings you back to the aristocratic Old South - back in time when etiquette was strict and moral rectitude was valued if not demanded. Your eyes are opened in a very real way to the manner in which slaves were regarded and how they were treated by their owners. (In today's parlance, even the word \"owners\" is repugnant.) Almost from the beginning the reader suspects a romance between Abby and her benefactor, Douglas Elling. How does it come to fruition? And does it come to fruition? Does the romance succeed and if so how? Does it survive intervening circumstances and the nefarious Cora-Rae Cunningham? The book becomes a page-turner.

I don\u2019t usually read historical romance but this story just grabbed me from the beginning. It was so well researched and written that you really felt like you were in Charleston in 1846! Even though it is a romance, it also covers the important issues of that time, namely slavery and abolition without being trite and cliche. The heroine, Abby is a strong independent woman, which is rare for such a period. She was honest and loyal, though young and insecure. She goes through a lot in her young life and it was great to have her be avenged, and get a happily ever after. Douglas, the main character, fights for what he believes in and you can\u2019t help but root for him. The book moves at a fast pace and keeps you interested from the beginning.

During the 1840's, Trouble the Water is a richly detailed story about beytral, loss, love , deeply seeded beliefs, and the power of freedom.I fell in love with this book - the setting, the building relationship between Abby and Douglas, and the driving power of Clover to seek freedom and a better life for unborn children all drew me in. But what truly captured me was Clover through her strength of conviction, belief in self, and absolute determination to escape slavery. Her love for her children is palpable - and so is her desire for a different life for them. The growth of Abby and Douglas's relationship felt real to me and I appreciated how independent Abby was. Not an easy thing for a woman during that time period. The two of them, by the end, felt like partners and not just two people in love. And by that I mean, yes they overcame misunderstandings/misinterpretations, and yes they love each other, but they also come together as equals in the relationship with mutual respect for what the other is capable of. And for me that is the mark of a true love match.If you can't tell, this was a wonderful read to me and I would highly recommend it! I received a review e-arc via NetGalley from SparkPress.

His life changes and so does he but his life will soon change again when the daughter of a childhood friend comes to stay with him.Abby was sent away from England by her parents. Her family has fallen on hard times. She has been working long hours, taking care of her siblings. Her temperament is changing and it worries her father so he has turned to his old friend for help. Abby is not happy about the exile but she cannot disobey.Her arrival in America and first meeting with her new guardian is less than auspicious. He basically hands her off to a governess and ignores her. Until she is injured and he realizes he\u2019s been well, an ass. After that point they start to slowly connect. But forces conspire to keep them apart.This was a intriguing take on a romance novel to be sure. The familiar themes are there but surrounded by a very serious issue \u2013 slavery. The inclusion of that makes the tale rise above the typical boy meets girl tale. The story shows a little of the arrogance of slave owners and their thoughts on \u201ctheir people\u201d without getting too graphic. The side plot of a trip on the Underground Railroad was a thrilling part of the novel and I would have loved more of it.Ms. Friedland knows how to set a scene and do it well. As a reader you feel like you are there with the characters whether there is at a coming out ball at a Charleston plantation or a slave running in fear from that same place. It\u2019s a real skill for an author to bring her reader into time and place like that and I always appreciate the ones that do it well.No matter the dark underpinnings this is a love story at its heart and that aspect follows the expected path of the romance novel; boy meets girl. boy and girl hate each other, boy and girl realize they love each other, boy does something stupid, blah blah \u2013 you know the routine.

Meanwhile, Mr. Elling remains paralyzed by the grief of losing his wife and young daughter 2 years ago and has been unable to move forward or take any action in regaining a semblance of the life he held so dear and the causes he once felt so passionately about. Will they find some common ground? Will they become what each other needs to move on from their pasts?Set against the backdrop of the agitated 1840\u2019s South, slavery has been abolished in the North and Southerners are fretful as resistance rises and the underground railroad is alive and well, Trouble the Water captivated me from page 1 and kept me turning the pages. I can\u2019t really compare it to any other similar historical fiction pieces because I haven\u2019t read many, but I can tell you I really enjoyed it. This was so much more than a story about a girl down on her luck in the 1840\u2019s, it involved an exploration of living as a woman in the 1800\u2019s, how scary and unstable life could be during this tumultuous time in history and how people can surprise you. I found Friedland\u2019s pace to be perfect and every time I picked this one up I found myself pleasantly immersed in a time and place I\u2019ve never been, with a cause and some characters worth rooting for!

Unfortunately despite the fact that I loved the main characters, the surroundings and the premise I didn't love the novel as a whole. I found myself frustrated by repetition. Abigail's hesitancy about Douglas and his fear of letting her in plagued most of the story until all of a sudden they realised their romantic interest in each other. It was sudden and yet complete foreseeable. Then the whole joy of the plot is unravelled by the anti-heroine and we are thrust into a multi-continent search and rescue mission.I felt the background scenery (homes, plantations, clothing and social aspects) were very well done and I had a fantastic vision of their world. I really did also enjoy the detail regarding the underground railway stops Douglas was involved in.Likely my biggest hurdle with the novel overall was the slowness of the first three quarters and the speed of the last quarter wrap up.

Douglas Elling, owner of Elling Exports and a large inherited estate is to be Abigail Milton\u2019s guardian for a year commencing sometime in 1845. The setting remains in Charleston for much of the book and there is more than adequate description of southern society and the differentiation between races. It is at its core a love story with a few twists but ultimately an inordinate amount of handwringing and mental haranguing. The writing was admirable but the repetitiveness of the mental anxiety was exhausting. Had I realized the depth of description of the pre civil war Charleston setting I probably would have passed on this book. The descriptions of the slavers and treatment of the slaves was revolting but all too realistic.Thank you NetGalley and SparkPress for an ARC"}, {"userName": "Alissa Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6627205-alissa-smith", "userReview": "The end of this novel will leave you with both a smile and a tear in your eye. This is a wonderful story set in the 1840\u2019s following several characters mainly in South Carolina. Abby has just arrived off a boat from the slums England to stay with a friend of her parents, Dennis, who was once part of the upper class social scene. I enjoyed following Abby\u2019s story-going to her first ball, lessons with her governess, not to mention her introduction to southern slavery. While Dennis pays his wages to his workers, Abby\u2019s new friend Gracie\u2019s family still has house slaves, including 17 year old Clover. The author has quite a way with words. It\u2019s incredibly interesting how she took the stories of such different people and wove them together so well. And the descriptions of the ballrooms and gowns makes you feel like you\u2019re sipping lemonade or sweet tea and watching it all unfold in front of you. If you are a fan of historical fiction, southern fiction, or reading in general, I highly recommend this book"}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3645871-gina", "userReview": "I won an ARC of this book through a Goodreads Giveaway. Set in Charleston 20 years before the civil war Trouble the Water is a historical romance that explores many issues of the time - class, slavery and abolitionism as well as high society social drama. All the characters were charming, even the antagonist, and the underground railroad portrayal was vivid. It is clear Friedland did extensive research and her descriptions do a good job of transporting you to the period but at times the wording was a bit repetitive. I also wish the two stories being told were better entwined. I did become invested in Abigail's plight, though that wasn't until about halfway through, and even then I was always aware of the cliche aspects. The predictable nature of the plot, transparency in the characters' actions, and an ending that felt slightly rushed left me a bit disappointed. That said I predict many will enjoy this cozy, heartwarming read. 3/5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Mary Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1527090-mary-robinson", "userReview": "With thanks to the author, Jacqueline Friedland, the publisher, Spark Press, and NetGalley.com for the advanced reader copy.\"Trouble the Water\" is an enjoyable historical fiction novel set in Charleston, SC in the 1840s. Abby is a young British girl sent to live with a dear friend of her fathers after her family's fall into debt. She arrives and finds the widower who is entrusted with her care to be a gruff and irksome man, and the ways of the American South different from her homeland. Well researched, the publisher blurbs spoke of abolition and teh end of slavery. All told, it is more of a romance novel, with the ending fairly predictable from about the 4th chapter. I found the characters all questioning their own emotions and reaction to be repetitive and niave at best. I enjoyed the prose, but the story, in the end, lacked enough depth to be worthwhile."}, {"userName": "Reyna Gentin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56599871-reyna-gentin", "userReview": "I just finished Jacqueline Friedland's wonderful debut novel, Trouble the Water. A love story set in pre-Civil War Charleston, Friedland successfully sets the scene of the turbulent times her characters inhabit without overdoing it. I don't read a lot of historical fiction, but Friedland made the period accessible, and the backdrop provided a way to consider more serious issues along with the romantic ones. Friedland took on the ambitious task of presenting several different points of view, and she rose to the challenge. I would love to see more of Abby and Douglas in the future!"}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27452864-gina", "userReview": "Thanks to Jacqueline Friedland & Caitlin Hamilton Summie for the ARC of \"Trouble the Water.\"This book is a historical/romance fiction novel. I do enjoy reading historical fiction but the middle section of the book went kind of slow for me. Once I got to the last few chapters, I really enjoyed the book. I was puzzled as to why the book had the title but the last page reveals the real reason.If you enjoy reading historical/romance fiction set in the south just before the Civil War, you'll enjoy this book. Over all, it was a good first book, and I look forward to the next one."}], "description": "Abigail Milton was born into the British middle class, but her family has landed in unthinkable debt.

When she arrives in Charleston at the age of seventeen, Abigail discovers that the man her parents raved about is a disagreeable widower who wants little to do with her. To her relief, he relegates her care to a governess, leaving her to settle into his enormous estate with little interference. But just as she begins to grow comfortable in her new life, she overhears her benefactor planning the escape of a local slave\u2014and suddenly, everything she thought she knew about Douglas Elling is turned on its head. Abby\u2019s attempts to learn more about Douglas and his involvement in abolition initiate a circuitous dance of secrets and trust. As Abby and Douglas each attempt to manage their complicated interior lives, readers can\u2019t help but hope that their meandering will lead them straight to each other.
