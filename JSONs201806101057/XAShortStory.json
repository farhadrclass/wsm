She is the only member of her immediate family to survive and she decides to record some of her experiences in a diary. She doesn\u2019t tell us anything about how this horrific situation came about, but we are quickly drawn into her terrifying world, which is now inhabited by creatures that she calls \u201cUglies\u201d. Given the chance, they would kill her, or infect her with their madness through a bite or even a scratch. She hides in a cellar during the day and goes out to forage for food at night, always on the alert for the Uglies. X records the demise of her parents and sister and there is a hint that she can recognise one of her friends who has been turned.This story is full of understated horror and emotion. X tells her story as it is and it is the power of Jack Croxall\u2019s writing which brings it to life. As readers, we bring our previous experiences to bear on the stories we read; I was reminded strongly of the masterful \u201cI am Legend\u201d and also the classic novel \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d. I hope that Jack Croxall will write many more novels and short stories - I certainly will be reading them!As a footnote, I\u2019d like to add that I think this story has great potential for use in the classroom. I taught English to teenagers for several years and, although retired, I found that when I had finished reading X, I was thinking of all the ways I would have used it. There are wonderful opportunities for creative writing lessons and discussion."}, {"userName": "Lloyd Baron", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13009616-lloyd-baron", "userReview": "Written in the form of a journal, this short story leaps into the middle of the story. Much has happened in the world and to the girl in question. However, you do not know what, but you can guess it isn't good.Deciding to call herself X, a teenage girl begins to write a journal detailing her life after some kind of event which has changed the world. She is hiding out in a basement and turns to the pages as a way of making sense of what is happening and to detail what she thinks may be her last few days alive.It is a heartbreaking recounting of what has come before. We know something bad has happened, even though to begin with her writing is somewhat lighthearted, but as she sinks deeper into despair we learn the full force of what she has had to live through. In a world where a future seems pointless, she recalls her lust for life and desires for what she had planned.Even without the gripping conclusion this short story will have you determined to live life, because you never know when the end of the world could happen.BUY IT.... it's cheaper than most bars of chocolate, so what do you have to lose?

We don't know who X is but we feel her plight. On the surface of it, not a lot is happening, and yet the ghosts of traumas that have gone before haunt every page. It very much reminded me of a YA version of Cormack McCarthy's The Road, with that same cold, beautiful bleakness, and that same heart-breaking certainty that this situation can only end badly. Please, please, Mr Croxall, write some more X."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14938021-mandy", "userReview": "Great little story, will be looking out for more from this author."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7509988-elyse", "userReview": "I really liked this short story.

I guess it is because they are so accessible, being easy to read on the daily commute to work or school, or even on your lunch break. When I heard that Jack Croxall was planning on releasing X, I simply had to know more. You may remember that I loved his young adult Victorian-era adventure, Tethers, and so I knew whatever X may be, it was a certainty that it was going to be good.X follows a fifteen year old girl, who for some unknown reason, is hiding out in the basement of an old house in the English countryside. For outside lay scariness and horror. As you read, you learn that these uglies could in fact be zombies, although they aren\u2019t exactly specified. They drag themselves around, biting and eating people, which in turn is enough to \u2018turn\u2019 the victim into one of them. We follow X as she records her final thoughts.Written largely as a series of journal entries, X is a very clever short story. Perhaps, in my opinion, simply because of the great portrayal of X. Jack Croxall does a fantastic job at getting in to the head of a teenage girl, and portraying her in such an authentic way. She\u2019s no superhero, she\u2019s not trained in martial arts; she\u2019s just a normal school kid, a girl who used to have a family, a girl who has a crush on one of her school friends. And that is exactly why this story hits you. This is a girl who has been thrown in to such an extreme situation, who must survive the horrors that wait outside, and by writing down her thoughts, it gives her a voice \u2013 transforming her from a nobody into a somebody.By writing in the first person, Jack Croxall gives the reader such a personal account of X. Therefore we don\u2019t need strong imagery techniques such as similes and metaphors. We need only the exact account \u2013 and that is strong enough. It is often touching, especially towards the end of the story, where the exact truth behind X\u2019s story is revealed. It\u2019s gripping and emotional, but told in a very as-matter-of-fact way, which doesn\u2019t detach you from X, but instead gives way for respect and sympathy. This girl didn\u2019t have a choice, but manages to survive through intuition and instinct.I thought the theme of sisterly love was exceptionally endearing as well as understanding, giving readers that little bit extra to relate to. It is also gives strong emotion to the story, especially when all is revealed. It is the little flashbacks that gives this story that added bit of depth too, which can be difficult to achieve when there really is only one character. I also loved the unanswered questions that this story evokes. What has happened to the world? Why has zombies suddenly appeared? What happens to X? But where cliffhangers can be annoying or frustrating for some, here it adds a poignant message of loneliness, detachment and a realisation that only the best survive. Life is cruel in X\u2019s world.Zombie stories can sometimes alienate people, but what Jack Croxall achieves in his short story is nothing short of brilliance. He has such a strong voice that connects with X, making her easily familiar and authentic, which is key for getting the readers to sympathise with her plight. This is less like a horror story, more like a personal thriller of sorts, and X\u2019s personal account, which often asks the readers rhetorical questions, is emotional, harrowing and utterly believable. This isn\u2019t a story about a chemical pathogen, a world disaster, it\u2019s about the survival of an ordinary girl, who must rise up and survive, as well as swallow down the grief and loneliness this sudden existence asks for. The impending doom that awaits X is engrossing \u2013 if you like a good read that captures your attention then I\u2019d definitely recommend this."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6437963-rebecca", "userReview": "Honestly I'm not usually a fan of short stories - I prefer novels, as they provide more for me to sink my teeth into. X is one of few exceptions. I decided to read it in the spur of the moment but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The concept, the writing, the mood - everything was just brilliant, even though it was so short and simplistic.X is essentially the diary of a dying girl. We know very little about her, only that she's lost her family in an apocalypse that she's survived up until the point of being scratched by the \"Uglies\" herself. She has a gun, two bullets and the knowledge of what she might have to do when the time comes. While waiting for the inevitable, she decides to document her final thoughts for whoever might find her diary later. As a short story, it did not particularly go into serious depth in terms of world building or character development but it really wasn't necessary. It was such a compelling read. I liked the mystery that surrounded the protagonist - not knowing her name (or much about her or what happened, in fact) added to the atmosphere of the story. It literally grabbed me - I just had to keep on reading until I knew exactly what happened. X's main strength is definitely it's ability to hook the reader into the unnamed protagonist's mind and her world. I feel that if it was a full-length novel, it wouldn't have been anywhere near as effective. Some stories are supposed to be short and this one really works.It was wonderfully written, well thought out, and just plain chilling. For such a short story, it definitely packs a punch. Now I really want to check out the author's other book, Tethers.This review is also on my blog"}, {"userName": "Megan Readinginthesunshine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11829532-megan-readinginthesunshine", "userReview": "Did I mention that I LOVE short stories? I find them so great because you can just pick them up and read them so easily, and they are SO ACCESSIBLE for everyone \u2013 whether you\u2019re on a journey, want something to read in your lunchbreak, or just fancy reading something a bit shorter.

That is, if she even lasts a few days\u2026I really loved this, I was drawn in from the first sentence, and I was gripped to what I was reading. Who is X? Why is she in the cellar? What has happened to her?I loved that the story was written in a journal format, as it helped me feel a lot closer to X. It felt very personal, as though I was inside her head and knew all of her thoughts, hopes and fears. I felt for her in the situation she was in, and I always wanted to read on to find out what would happen to her. I really liked X, her determination in her fight for survival shone through and I\u2019d love to say more but I don\u2019t want to spoil what is a fantastic short story!I could constantly feel the tension in X\u2019s words, as if every moment may be her last, and I was completely hooked throughout.

All we know is that X is writing in her journal, documenting what she believes to be her last days, and that she sounds more like a soldier than a 15 year old girl. Hiding out in the cellar of an old farmhouse, X has a gun with two bullets--one for her defense, and the other perhaps to end her own life, if (or when) it comes to that. She simply doesn't know how much longer she can survive. But she hasn't given up yet! And as long as she can find supplies, to get through the long days and the longer nights, she will continue to hide out in the cellar from the things outside that are trying to get in. This was such an interesting story! My only complaint is that it was too short! A quick read, full of mystery and gripping from start to finish, I was dying to know what happened with each turn of the page! And somehow (although I cannot tell you how, but it was cleverly orchestrated), I felt pulled into the story and made to be a part of it! Fantastic!

I stumbled across X and downloaded it straight away, not even caring to read the blurb!X is a short story that quickly pulls you into a world of a despairing teenager called X who is living in some kind of dystopian setting on her own, struggling to survive. There are \u2018uglies\u2019 who are wandering around, killing every living thing in their way. X is hiding within the confines of an old farmhouse cellar and it is there she decides to keep a diary to document what she does and what she knows about these uglies so if a survivor ever comes across her body, she might able to help them. This was SUCH a teaser of a short story and I really want to know more about this world X inhabits. Luckily, the lovely Jack has said he\u2019s working on a novel length story set in X\u2019s world which is SO exciting! I cannot wait to find out more about what has happened to everyone else in the world and why X has seemingly managed to survive and whether there are any more survivors out there. This book gave me a really lovely reminder of a book called Survivors by Terry Nation which I read years ago and thoroughly enjoyed. I LOVED the perspective of this book. It was told through diary entries which was really clever. I felt like I was trapped in this claustrophobic environment and I was reading the diary of someone who may or may not be alive. It was a really tactile experience: I could almost smell the damp ground and feel the cold on my fingers as I sat reading. As I mentioned when I reviewed Tethers, I am so in love with Jack\u2019s writing style. It is so immersive and gripping and so beautifully worded that you don\u2019t want to stop reading. I read this short story in one go and did a tiny scream when I finished because I wanted so much more! I am so impatient and cannot wait until the next installment in this world.

She\u2019s now living in the aftermath of the terrible events that occurred on the outside of her protective cellar, and her story is recorded by her as memoirs in a diary.Usually the YA books that I read are girly pre-chick-lit books, so this was completely different for me. I\u2019m glad I got to read it though because I got right inside X\u2019s head and felt like I was living her story. The story is basically X recording her daily thoughts and what she gets up to in a journal, so it\u2019s written quite personally, but also as it\u2019s written just like how she\u2019s actually thinking, with changes of the words she wants to use, and with her changing her mind on things she\u2019s written, it\u2019s really easy to just completely immerse yourself!She is living and fending for herself in this cellar, which speaks highly of her character as it\u2019s really built on true grit and a determination to live. The outside world has been taken over by \u201cuglies\u201d which I imagined as zombies like the creepers in Minecraft \u2013 don\u2019t know why! They infect others by biting/scratching and so far X seems to have been unaffected, but as she tells her story it\u2019s hard not to be sad for her and how she has come to be in the situation she is in.This is a well written horror story which is just the right side of scary, but is also really easy to imagine yourself in the plot.

I was excited by the concept that it\u2019s a diary which has been found, so because of this, the only narrative you have is what \u201cX\u201d decides to write. You get to piece the story together from what she tells you and the rest is up to your imagination.Now, I do have a pretty good imagination with books, I can visualise characters and surrounding pretty well. However, that does not take away from the fact that this book has as much description as a book of this genre needs. If you\u2019re reading someone\u2019s diary you can\u2019t expect script, you can\u2019t expect a lot of description. If you do expect a lot of description and character development then I\u2019d love to see your diary, it must be a masterpiece!Keeping it simple has worked really well in this instance and it doesn\u2019t feel like anything is missing. There is enough feeling on certain entries to make you realise that she\u2019s feeling regret and sadness, and then on the other hand you can see that she\u2019s trying to be light hearted so she can cope with what\u2019s going on around her. The nicest thing about this book I think is that there are no dates on the diary entries and nothing that could really date it fast. The thing I hate is when books date themselves within seconds.

The incredible detail of the world is almost a mystery as Jack Croxall manages to get across vivid scenes without any long descriptive passages at all. The main character talks of her nightmarish experiences in a cold and detached way, and that makes them even more harrowing. I'm amazed that so much can be conveyed in such a short tale. I was left with a genuine shiver down my spine. Amazing work, Mr Croxall :)"}], "description": "X knows she's as good as dead.
