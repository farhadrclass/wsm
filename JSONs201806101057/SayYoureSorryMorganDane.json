She is a thirty-three-year-old assistant district attorney. Her first case after two years is the murder of her occasional baby sitter (Tessa, eighteen-year-old). For this case she uses Lance\u2019s help. Lance was a former police officer but after a bullet on his leg, he joined to a PI firm. Morgan and Lance knew each other since high school. And They have some feelings toward each other from that time. He works on a case too, a missing girl. They think maybe these two case are connected to each other somehow.Okay, this story was really, really, really slow. The author didn\u2019t give anything to occupy my mind. I even didn\u2019t bother to think about the cases. I read first 70% and the things that I knew till then was from the first chapters, nothing more! Therefor I started to skim and skip. It didn\u2019t intrigued me, at all. The slowness of it was killing me. So many details that wasn\u2019t necessary to be said.The story is told in multiple POV, 3rd person. It\u2019s the first installment in \"Morgan Dane\" series but it can be read as a stand-alone. And I definitely do NOT reading the next book! I really didn\u2019t enjoy it.

When Morgan returns home to a small town after the death of her husband, she\u2019s about to take a promising job when a beloved neighborhood girl turns up brutally murdered and the seemingly nice boy Morgan has known for years is accused of her death. Morgan volunteers to defend him because she can\u2019t believe Nick did it. In doing so, she is potentially destroying her career and she is definitely incurring the wrath of her community. Morgan and Lance uncover clues that the police, who are already convinced Nick did it because they found his DNA inside her, do not.

Say You\u2019re Sorry picks up two years after Morgan returned home as she plans to get back to work by starting a job at the DA\u2019s office. However, Morgan\u2019s life is thrown into chaos when her babysitter is murdered and her neighbor\u2019s son is accused of the crime. Believing Nick to be innocent, Morgan agrees to take on the case at the request of her neighbor. With the help of an old friend turned private eye, Morgan begins her investigation and aims to prove her neighbor is innocent and the real killer is still at large.Morgan is an incredibly strong character and really brave despite the difficulties she's facing while defending Nick's case. She also has a great sense of loyalty for those she cares about. I love how much she cares about her family and that even when she's busy with the case, she finds time to be with her daughters. Lance has had a difficult few months recovering from being shot while he was still on the police force. As a private detective, he has more freedom when it comes to his work, but he misses being on the force. Through his work as a P.I. he gets to work with Morgan, whom he has known since high school. I really enjoyed their working relationship, as well as the introduction of something more in their private life. I feel the two fit together very well and I'm excited to see where things go between them in future books.The mystery surrounding Tessa's death was intriguing. There were several suspects over the course of the book which led to constant twists and turns. I suspected several people, but never actually the person who was the killer. Getting chapters inside the killer's head gave great insight into how twisted the killer really was. I also enjoyed how the author wove several other small scandals/mysteries into the story.I read this book without reading the connecting series, Scarlet Falls, but had no issues understanding who everyone was and how they were all connected to each other. The author does a great job at making this its own series while including little Easter eggs for those familiar with the prior series. For being a romantic suspense book, Say You\u2019re Sorry is more on the thriller/mystery end, but there are enough elements of romance that seem to imply that may take more of a center role in future books.Overall, Say You\u2019re Sorry was a fun read with a ton of action and a compelling mystery. I\u2019m excited for more books to come out in this series as I really enjoyed these characters and the setting. I will definitely be checking out the connecting series, Scarlet Falls, soon.**I received an advanced copy from Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.**"}, {"userName": "CD {Boulder Blvd}", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31857175-cd-boulder-blvd", "userReview": "Morgan Dane is a widow with young kids living with her father and a troubled young woman she has pulled into her home. Her husband was killed in Iraq two years ago and she hasn't really been able to pull herself out of her grieve and move on with her life. She has just accepted a job with District Attorney's office and is trying to move forward. But before her job can start, she is pulled into looking for a girl, Tessa, who had babysat her young children. The grandparents can't find her and are getting nervous. Asking her friend Lance Kruger to help look for her, they discover her body in a teen hangout area. The police identify her neighbor Nick as the killer. She knows Nick. He plays chess with her father, her kids adore him and she doesn't want to believe he's guilty. Nick's dad doesn't have a lot of money, is working to mortgage his house for Nick's defense and asks Morgan for help.Putting her new job on the line, she teams up with Lance to prove Nick's innocence and find the real killer. Lance is a great guy. Previously injured with the police department, he is now working as a PI. Morgan and Lance also dated in high school, so there is a lot of friendship and history between them. Lance is not an OTT alpha hero (thank goodness)! He sacrifices for those he cares about. And he cares about Morgan. The romance is a very believable and a slow burn. The plot is really well paced as Morgan and Lance search for the killer of Tessa and try to prove the innocence of Nick. I don't want to give anything away, but it really pulled me in. You get a little bit of the killer's perspective (definitely a very sick individual) which adds to the overall suspense of the book. Say You're Sorry by Melinda Leigh is an excellent start to the new Morgan Dane series and now my favorite book written by her. For me it was a true 5 star read and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.

She is a widow with three little girls to raise, a grandfather to help care for them and a young woman living with them who has serious medical issues. She has a full plate and now feels the need to return to work as an assistant district attorney to help battle the malaise that seems to have settled over her life like a cloud. Her occasional babysitter, Tessa, goes missing and Morgan calls her old high school flame and former Scarlet Lake Police Officer, Lance Kruger, to help her find Tessa. They find her dead at a high school hangout spot at the lake. At first the evidence points to Morgan's neighbor, Nick. How can a young man who reads stories to her little girls and plays chess with her grandfather possibly have done this?Morgan's answer is: He didn't.

Great start to a series!Morgan Dane is a widowed mother of three girls. Her husband was killed in the line of duty and she is still mourning 2 years later. She moved back to Scarlet Falls to live with her grandfather. She hasn\u2019t worked outside the home since her husband was killed. She finally decides it\u2019s time to re-enter the work force. She is an attorney and has agreed to go to work for the District Attorney\u2019s office. She receives a phone call late at night from the grandparents of a young girl who baby sits occasionally for her stating she is missing. Morgan calls Lance Kruger, an old high school boyfriend, whom she has become good friends with since her return to Scarlet Falls. Lance is currently working as a PI while on medical leave from the police department due to a gunshot wound to his thigh. They discover the girl\u2019s brutally murdered body. When Nick, her 20 year old neighbor, and friend of the family, is accused of killing his girlfriend, Morgan agrees to represent him pro bono. This ends her job with the DA\u2019s office before it even began. She goes to the PI office Lance works for to ask for their help. Morgan and Lance work well together. Morgan is still dealing with her past while trying to move forward. Lance is dealing with the loss of a job that defined him and trying to figure out his future. He\u2019s been interested in Morgan for a while, but knows she\u2019s not ready for a relationship, so has resolved himself to the friend zone. Plus, he\u2019s dealing with a mom who has mental health issues. Lance comes across as a stand up guy with unquestionable integrity, honesty and a big heart. Morgan shares those qualities. I loved that there was no histrionics, immature meltdowns, or ridiculous outbursts between Morgan and Lance. I never saw the killer coming! This rarely happens for me, so I was impressed! This book is a real page turner. There is also a great cast of supporting characters as well. Grandpa is a real sweetheart and very encouraging to Morgan. Morgan\u2019s girls are good kids. Her youngest is a bit of a spitfire! Lincoln Sharp is a retired detective and owner of the PI firm where Lance works. He is a father figure for Lance and another stand up guy.There isn\u2019t much romance to this romantic suspense. However, the ending has me hoping there\u2019s more to come in the following books!

Morgan decides to help defend Nick and do her own investigating with the help of Lance Kruger, an ex-cop turned private eye, to get her client off and find the real killer. Say You're Sorry if the first book of the Morgan Dane series by Melinda Leigh. The series is apparently a spin off from another series but I never found myself lost from not having read other books my this author and felt the story was built rather well without having read other background from other series but after this one I may just go back and pick up her other books. The story is a romantic suspense read that changes the point of view all throughout including some chapters from the prospective of the killer. Morgan however is the main character in the story, a former attorney who became a stay at home mom that is just returning back to work. Along with her former high school boyfriend turned P.I. they tackle the case to find a killer. The romance isn't overly pushed in the story letting a reader get invested more into the thriller side of the book as the investigation goes on.

But Melinda Leigh is an author I can always count on for fantastic reads and \u2018Say You\u2019re Sorry\u2019 more than lives up to this billing. But I love Leigh\u2019s heroines and heroes for so many reasons: they use their smarts and wits and intelligence to get ahead (sometimes without even needing to fire a gun), they generally don\u2019t have immature meltdowns that are out of character and aren\u2019t afraid to admit their uncertainty and doubts even when cornered. The all-round maturity certainly helps. \u2018Say You\u2019re Sorry\u2019 introduces us to Morgan Dane, a district attorney whose life was blown wide open when her husband died during his deployment, leaving her to sort herself out back home with 3 young children. But the fragility and vulnerability never quite go away no matter how much she convinces herself that the time to move on has arrived, up until a case convinces her to do what\u2019s right rather than what\u2019s convenient. Leigh ratchets up the tension from the start and very much like every episode of a TV crime series, begins the show with the panicked pants of a potential victim who flees an unknown killer, who surprisingly, acts uncontrollably because of his own self-preservation instincts. But what looks like a simple teenage case of murder unearths a whole load of secrets and several twists that I didn\u2019t see coming, which made the ride more exciting. I liked both Morgan and Lance together, and loved their partnership which seems to bode very well for the next few books that Leigh has in mind. Morgan\u2019s strong sense of justice appealed to me deeply, especially when it came to her determination to see a falsely-accused teenager out of jail for a crime he didn\u2019t commit while tanking her career in the process. Lance\u2019s solid character was as well, a perfect complement for Morgan's. His broken dreams have left him a position where he hasn\u2019t been able to be anything other than the police officer he once was, but there\u2019s a sense of untouchable integrity and dignity about him that makes him quite a shining example of what a romantic hero should be. \u2019Say You\u2019re Sorry\u2019 is however, more focused on the suspense than romance, heavy with the potential of Morgan/Lance which sort of remains unfulfilled by the end of the book, but I\u2019m hoping there\u2019re more to come that will deepen this relationship between the both of them. I\u2019m still vacillating between feeling a little cheated out of hot and heavy times and satisfied because justice is finally served, but as long as Leigh delivers these in the next few books, I\u2019d be happy as a clam. *ARC by netgalley(always grateful, mind)"}, {"userName": "Suzanne (Under the Covers Book blog)", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3575839-suzanne-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "I am still relatively new to the thriller genre, I like to dip my toe in every now and then, however, in this book Melinda Leigh has tempted me to belly flop right in.

Except before she even gets started in her new job, tragedy strikes in the small town of Scarlet Falls. Even worse, the crime is being pinned on someone Morgan believes is innocent and she's determined to do whatever it takes to see the right person bought to justice. Will she succeed or will she face a tough, uphill battle that could turn deadly at any time?What a highly entertaining, fast-paced, gripping read Ms. Leigh has penned in this book, encompassing well-written dialogue that kept me enthralled from start to finish; a plot with lots of twists and turns that kept surprising me and had me determined to discover what would come next; and two main characters that were determined to do what was right in seeking justice for the victim no matter how dangerous things became. The way this story started had me on the edge-of-my seat and drew me into the story immediately with what was happening, as it's palpable that any number of people could be a suspect. What would happen to whoever was in trouble? Would they be saved? As for the dialogue, it was told from several characters points-of-view and was intense due to the main characters back stories and all that they go through to prove Morgan's client is innocent. Going head-to-head with several secondary characters that are either extremely dangerous or very influential in the community should concern Morgan, but no matter what threats or scrutiny she faces, she remains loyal to her job and strong and brave in her determination to seek the truth when everyone is determined to prosecute her client just so their jobs are secure. But what I liked most about Morgan is that she didn't back down, especially when things became more and more dangerous for her, Lance and her client. While Lance, he's been through a lot in past months with having to give up working as a cop. It wasn't easy, but he's overcome it to become a very good private investigator. Moreover, I liked that he was willing to help Morgan, even though he wasn't as certain as the heroine was about her client's innocence. Yet, what I liked most of all about the hero was how protective he was of the heroine and how they wouldn't give up until they discovered the truth. Overall, Ms. Leigh has delivered an incredible read in this book where the suspense and growing relationship between Lance and Morgan made this story a real page turner. The way this story ended was a tad alarming because of the situation Morgan finds herself in, but I liked that Morgan was finally able to move on from her past and the death of her husband. And lastly, I'm looking forward to more of this series because of the main and secondary characters, especially Lance's mom, a bright woman with a serious medical condition that makes Lance continually worry about her; and Sharp, Lance's boss and a man that is determined to make everyone a health nut. The moments where he was trying to convince Morgan what was good for her had me amused. I would highly recommend Say You're Sorry by Melinda Leigh, if you enjoy romantic suspense or books by authors Kendra Elliot, Mary Burton, Rita Herron or Nancy Bush."}, {"userName": "Charlotte Miller", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11907950-charlotte-miller", "userReview": "A young woman is brutally raped and murdered and her boyfriend stands accused in Melinda Leigh\u2019s Say You\u2019re Sorry.

The murder of a girl opens a Pandora's box of a litany\u00a0of secrets, lies and other nefarious happenings in Scarlett Falls. This new series is set in a location fans of Melinda Leigh's will be familiar with. It's a spin off of her Scarlet Falls trilogy series and features the sister of Stella Dane who was the heroine in the last book of that series. Morgan Dane is a widow who was left with 3 young daughters to raise on her own after her husband died in Iraq. She's recently moved back home to Scarlet Falls to live with her grandfather who helps with the girls. After two years of taking a break from her job as an assistant DA to grieve, she has decided to go back to work in the same field but before she starts her plans get derailed when she decides to be the lawyer for a 20 year old family friend who has just been accused of viciously murdering his girlfriend. She enlist the help of a childhood friend, Lance Kruger who is currently working as a Private Investigator for Lincoln Sharp. Great start to the series with a strong female lead who uses her intelligence to solve problems, can psychically take care of herself but yet also isn't afraid to show a vulnerable side. Lance is also a strong leading male character but without being to over the top alpha. He and Morgan work great together along with Sharp and I look forward to seeing them solve more cases together in future books."}, {"userName": "Rachel (TheShadesofOrange)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7487619-rachel-theshadesoforange", "userReview": "3.0 StarsThe first two chapters of this novel were utterly gripping. The author immediately caught my attention with that suspenseful and frightening opening sequence. Needless to say, I was quite excited to read the rest of the novel. Unfortunately, by chapter three, the novel transitioned to the kind of average mystery story that I have read many, many times. The story is told through multiple perspectives. By far, the strongest perspective was from the unnamed murderer who was compelling and, at times, even sympathetic for a villain. This perspective was intentionally cryptic in order to keep the identity of the murderer hidden from the reader until the final reveal. The writing started out strong with vivid descriptions in those initial chapters. However, later on, the writing became weaker. Specifically, the writing was repetitive, as the author reused the same phrases too often. The characters were fairly decent and interesting. The female lead defense attorney sometimes acted as a strong, independant woman and other times became emotionally fragile. My main complaint stems from my dislike of romance in mystery novels. There was too much emotional elements in the story for my personal reading tastes. I felt that the romance diluted the suspense and atmosphere of the story.The mystery itself was decent with several potential leads. The main investigation was conducted from the perspective of the defense attorney and private investigator, which provided a break from the traditional police perspective. The ending was not particularly obvious and fairly satisfying. Personally, I prefer reading darker, less emotional mysteries. However, I would recommend this novel to readers who enjoy mysteries with a healthy serving of clean romance.I (accidentally) requested from Netgalley and decided to read this anyways out of respect for the publisher & author."}, {"userName": "Britton Epps", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19591097-britton-epps", "userReview": "Started off really strong.

Her characterization of the main leads was compelling. I liked Morgan Dane, widowed mother of three young girls, who were particularly cute, and came across as genuine. I also liked Lance Kruger, former police detective, turned PI, who takes care of his mentally fragile mother.As Morgan is about to sign her new employment agreement with the DA\u2019s office of Scarlett Falls, NY, the murder of teenager Tessa shakes up to town. Morgan knew Tessa, who babysat for girls every Friday. What is worse is that the DA\u2019s office is very quick to arrest Nick, Tessa\u2019s boyfriend and Morgan\u2019s young neighbor. Morgan is absolutely convinced that Nick is innocent, and since she has not yet signed up for the ADA job, she decides on the spot to be his defense lawyer.The story unfolds as Morgan, Nick and his PI boss, Sharp, wade their way through a maze of possible witnesses and suspects; other young people who were at the lake the night Tessa was murdered. They interview them all with alternating success. It becomes clear to them, the closer they get to the truth, the more dangerous it gets. There are some pretty unstable people, and some unsuspected perverts living in this quiet little town in upstate NY.Overall, a very enjoyable read, without going too deep. The budding romance angle between Morgan and Lance was a bit repetitive and na\u00efve at times, but that\u2019s better than the alternative.I can\u2019t wait to read what Melinda Leigh does with the sequel.

Former prosecutor Morgan Dane and her three little girls return to her hometown of Scarlett Falls following the death of her husband in Iraq. As each day passes, Morgan takes another step in her new life without him. Her young babysitter is found murdered and her neighbour's son Nick is accused of her murder. Morgan cannot believe that Nick is the killer. He has been in her home many times, playing checkers with her father, playing with her daughters. When Nick's father asks for her help, she agrees to defend him and loses her job offer from the DA's office. Morgan's decision turns neighbours and the community against her and she turns to her friend Lance Kruger, an ex-cop turned investigator, to help her. As they investigate the girl's friends and school mates, it becomes apparent that there are many secrets in this small town. This was a well-crafted story, with a logical process of investigation and good character development. The author portrays Nick's determination to survive prison and remain strong in a way that has the reader rooting for him and drawing compassion from his strength. I really enjoyed this book and the way Morgan and Lance work together. Their mutual attraction is something Morgan is not yet comfortable confronting and Lance is very patient with her. It was a bit of a clich\u00e9 that the police felt it was an \"open and shut\" case but it did further the story. The killer is revealed but it is not who you think it is."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41955054-donna", "userReview": "Morgan Dane's husband died from an IED in Iraq two years ago.

SAY YOU\u201dRE SORRY (Morgan Dane #1) takes me back to one of my favorite fictional cities. Morgan Dane returns home to Scarlet Falls with her three young daughters after the death of her military husband in the Middle East. Living with her grandfather and a teenager rescued in a previous Scarlet Falls book, two years has passed and Morgan decides to return to work as an ADA. She wants to start moving forward at least professionally with her life.Lance Kruger was an SFPD officer, but is currently training to be a private investigator while recovering from a gunshot wound. His mentor, Lincoln Sharp started his own P.I. agency after retiring from the SFPD. Lincoln is more than just the ex-detective who worked Lance\u2019s missing father\u2019s case, he has been a father figure and an enormous help with Lance\u2019s mother.When Morgan\u2019s sometimes babysitter, Tessa is found raped and violently murdered, the blame falls on her boyfriend, Nick. Nick is Morgan\u2019s young neighbor who plays chess with her grandfather and reads to her girls. Even though the evidence is strong, Morgan just cannot believe Nick is guilty. Morgan turns down her ADA job and decides to not only defend Nick against false charges, but to find the real killer with the help of Lance and Lincoln.This book takes off and keeps a fast pace throughout. With multiple suspects there are many unexpected twists and turns in the plot. As you turn the pages to find justice for Tessa, many other small town secrets become unearthed. You also follow the story through both Morgan\u2019s and Lance\u2019s points-of-views, with some internal insights from the killer and Nick\u2019s time in lock-up. I loved the multiple views because they pull you into the head and intense emotions of each character in every situation.I was happy to learn from the author that there are at least four more proposed books for this series and Morgan will continue being the main character. This book has the beginnings of a new romance for Morgan with Lance and I am looking forward to its progression. I love a series that not only gives me great thrills and/or mysteries, but I get to follow a couple that I want to succeed in love.I am looking forward to the next book and a return to all of these great characters!Thank you very much to Montlake Romance, Melinda Leigh and Net Galley for allowing me to read this eARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Debra Webb", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5391196-debra-webb", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book very much!

Possible spoilersI have to admit I did have to skim through all the jail stuff with Nick. I just couldn\u2019t read about his fear and on-coming depression over everything that was being done to him when he was innocent, and he was only 20 years old. And I was thinking if the author kills off Nick while he\u2019s in jail I\u2019ll never read anything by her again. I\u2019ve read/listened 10 or 12 of Melinda Leigh\u2019s books but I was a little concerned when I got to Nick\u2019s arrest. I was totally shocked at who paid to have Nick stabbed while he was in jail, too.It did turn out fine for Nick BUT I can\u2019t say I was crazy about the two pedophiles in this story. The murdered girl was 18 and had been molested by the bad guy since she was 12. And the other girl was 15 or 16 and was being molested by her mother\u2019s boyfriend, until she ran away. It might have had a little too much pedophilia for me.I was surprised at who the killer was, but that\u2019s the way I like my mysteries.As always, there was no sex in this book but the F-bomb was used 17 times.I really like the players: Lance, Morgan, Sharp, Nick, and Bud. Stella and Brody, from other books, were in this but only for a second, which I was bummed about. As to the narrator: Another reviewer said Kate Rudd would have been a better choice for this book and I couldn\u2019t agree more. Cris Dukehart is simply a bad narrator; I don\u2019t care what anyone says. Her men\u2019s voices are some of the worst.
