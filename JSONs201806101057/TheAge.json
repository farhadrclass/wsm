Gerry is someone who is growing up too quickly for her own good, the people she spends her time with change her view and really bring her into an adult view of things. She is someone who is struggling with her own personality and is easily swayed by those around her. Her best friend, Ian struggles to help Gerry through her issues.I did really enjoy following Gerry's path to finding herself among a group of people who are older and often treat her as a kid. What sometimes confused me was the other storyline throughout the story, it is about a boy surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, learning how to get by and take care of himself and sometimes others in this scary time. This story would come up at different times and it would just switch to this perspective, confusing me as a reader at times to where I was in the story.I did really enjoy Gerry's character, despite her trying to find herself, she has spunk. She knows how to fight back, sometimes you can see how young she is with her attitude towards things, and other times you can see how she is trying to grow up too fast. She has issues with her mother, who you can see is trying hard to be a good parent knowing how hard it is to do it on her own.Gerry's father is not around so the male characters in her life add to the story, her best friend Ian is someone that you are not sure if she is in love with or aspires to be like. Then there is her grandfather, who through her is getting a second chance at being around for a child's life, but the way he spends time with Gerry makes you wonder if there is crazy in all parts of her life.Honestly, as confusing as this story was at times, I enjoyed the coming of age story during such a difficult period of time in history. I did like the characters that were written, they added a lot to the story, and I think each person Gerry comes into contact with really affects her life and personality in such a huge way. I think Nancy Lee has written a great story, yes it is a little confusing at times, but it's about a girl finding herself while so much is happening around her."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4008873-kim", "userReview": "Thought-provoking and disturbing, I enjoyed this and finished it in just a couple of days. A big part of that momentum came from my identification with the main character, who was a teen in the eighties and frightened of a looming nuclear winter. I was these things, too, though the narrator is a bit older than I was. I came away from the book feeling gutted by the harrowing climax, which takes place at a no-nukes demonstration in Vancouver, and mostly pleased with the lack of resolution. (There's a bit of treacly awww-shucks that I could have done without.) Also notable: the story-within-a-story, in which the narrator pictures herself as a boy in a post-apocalyptic world. The boy rises to the demands of his new life, going on raiding missions with the men of his adopted colony and falling in love with a barely characterized girl. I looked forward to these sections interspersed through the book and liked the way they wrapped up.Nancy Lee is a good writer and the book is well-plotted. If you enjoyed Dead Girls, I think you'll like this a lot."}, {"userName": "Chrissy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5250222-chrissy", "userReview": "I received this book from Goodreads.The Age is a gritty book about the confusing life of Gerry, a teenager in 1980's Vancouver. The threat of nuclear bombs hangs over her head as she deals with her sexuality, divorce, searching for her father and peace marches. Within the book is also the story of the boy and the girl - nuclear war survivors trying to stay alive in a violent dead world.Nancy Lee captures the role of a tough street kid in Gerry, but also shows us other facets of Gerry's personality through her friends. Sexy Megan, motherly Michelle, intelligent and confident Andri, confused and vacant Clem, and rebellious but dependable Ian.When Gerry gets in over her head with her friends and becomes confused about the role of men in her life, she turns to drugs and to her mother, but mostly she turns into herself.This book is a great read with a climactic ending."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/313428-linda", "userReview": "I wish I could say I was as excited reading this book as I was about winning it through Goodreads Giveaways. I just couldn't get into this story. Put it down 3 times... and only finished it because I got it through this site... otherwise I would have tossed it.I couldn't warm up to any of these characters (and I was in Vancouver as a young woman in the 80's) I found the plot dull, a great lack of meaningful dialogue and the heaps of narration totally boring.Couldn't wait to finish it and hope to never read anything like it again!"}, {"userName": "Krista Foss", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32010806-krista-foss", "userReview": "There's an addictive anxiety that runs through Nancy Lee's THE AGE that reminded me of Jose Saramago's BLINDNESS; through the sensitively drawn and astute characterization of the teenage Gerry, she perfectly captures an \"age\" that marked so many of us, while contemplating the personal costs of action and passivity.

The both combined is a harsh, but vivid awakening to the grief and anger that simmers not only in our teenagers, but in a world suffocating from the ongoing battle against political and social injustice in its fervor and fight toward some form of equilibrium.This is a story about Geraldine, referred to as Gerry, an angry and fiercely troubled teenager, an adrogynous-looking girl who de-feminizes her physicality to look and act more like a boy, a kid roughened up perhaps to subconsciously toughen herself up against the pain of her upbringing\u2014or rather in this case, her lack of one\u2014the physical and emotional abandonment of her father.In response, Gerry attaches herself to an older and exclusive group, one that is more than a bunch of misfits, but a group whose ideology is both dangerous and highly politicized\u2014activists whose plans to participate in a Peace March is more than succumbing to spectatorship, but rather a direct involvement in misguided terrorism.But, amidst the extremity of the book is a saving grace in a few of the unexpected characters, from Gerry\u2019s grandfather, Henry, a news reporter whose divorce to his third wife plummets him into emotional and financial bankruptcy, yet a reserved kindness to a granddaughter whose life has hardened her to attachment and kindness itself.To read the rest of my review, you're more than welcome to visit my blog, The Bibliotaphe Closet at: http://zaraalexis.wordpress.com- Zara"}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2028078-jane", "userReview": "Set in Vancouver in 1984, Gerry, the main character, is a teenager struggling with lots of difficult issues - anxiety about the threat of a nuclear incident, questioning her sexual identity, abandonment by her father, her mother\u2019s post divorce relationships, her best friend Ian's relationships with two other women and his love/hate relationship with her, and trying to fit in with a group of older misfits planning a violent incident during the upcoming peace march. And, she makes a lot of poor choices. So does Ian, despite his efforts to protect her.

It was tough to actually picture the story taking place in the city Vancouver had become, but to backcast from the here and now to then, plus an outlying possibility of nuclear fall-out, seems to make sense as the story centres on a tomboyish girl and the establishment of Peace Cove. Even Lee's description of the Peace March fracturing into a mob rule is a sideshadow for the imagined space that somehow become the most expensively unaffordable place on the planet."}, {"userName": "Danusia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12176773-danusia", "userReview": "Interesting read about a teenager's fears and hopes in a time of world unrest. Geraldine (Gerry) tries to cope with her parent's divorce and her father's abandonment, she yearns for love and acceptance as an adult, makes mistakes but survives them with physical and mental scars. The parallel story in a post-apocalyptic world did not seem related to the teenager story or it was related to it just because of Gerry's fears in relation to the nuclear arms escalation. I received the book from a First Reads GoodReads giveaway."}, {"userName": "Laurel Mosse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30936962-laurel-mosse", "userReview": "My first review! First off, I loved Dead Girls. Nancy Lee seemed so at home with short stories that I was really curious to see how she'd manage with a novel. She still writes like an angel. But the plot was sluggish and felt, well, stalled at times...writing in circles as though she didn't know where to take the story. The economy of a short story seems to suit her better (at least based on The Age)."}, {"userName": "T.

Her teenage narrator, Gerry, perfectly manifests the undercurrents of fear running through this period in history. Lee renders her character with a deep understanding of the teenage experience and Gerry\u2019s world hums with authenticity. She is a character I won\u2019t soon forget."}, {"userName": "Travis Evans", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5428816-travis-evans", "userReview": "Takes a looooooooooooong time to get going, which tested my patience. And while the story is interesting enough, the author is emphatic about poetic description instead of building a riveting story. The post-apocalyptic bits didn't really make sense (they're supposed to be scenes from an extended dream of the main character, I think), but they also didn't add much to the overall story."}, {"userName": "Andrew Gray", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2821098-andrew-gray", "userReview": "An excellent, beautifully written novel about fractured families, doomsday fears and a fully realized main character in the form of Gerry, who is bruised and battered by the world and keeps on going.

In THE AGE, Lee's prose hums with beauty and a sense of foreboding."}], "description": "Following the international success of the edgy and critically-acclaimed, Dead Girls, Nancy Lee\u2019s highly-charged debut novel, The Age is an ambitious and poignant exploration of the collapse of family, the price of friendship, and the human struggle to find meaning in life and death. A coming of age novel for today, The Age will appeal to readers of Annabel Lyon, Lisa Moore, Heather O'Neill.Set in Vancouver in 1984, as Soviet warships swarm the North Atlantic, The Age follows Gerry, a troubled teenager confronted with her single mom\u2019s newest relationship. When she takes solace in a ragtag group of activists planning a subversive protest at the city\u2019s upcoming peach march, her fascination with the group\u2019s leader, and her struggle with sexual identity creates a rift between Gerry and her best friend, Ian. Bolstered by her grandfather, an eccentric ex-news anchor in the throes of a bitter divorce, Gerry tries to put herself at the centre of the protest group\u2019s violent plot. When the demands of these complex relationship become too difficult, Gerry escapes to the role she knows best, survivor in a post-nuclear dystopia of her own creation. Gerry\u2019s real life and fantasy life alternate and accelerate until a collision of events and consequences forces her towards life or death decisions in both worlds.Electric and engaging, with piercing observation, subversive wit, and the same fearlessness that caused a sensation amongst critics and fans of Dead Girls, The Age is at once a startling post-apocalyptic drama, a harrowing journey through adolescent recklessness and desire, and a dark portrait of a generation molded by nuclear anxiety. Its arrival confirms Nancy Lee as one of Canadian Literature\u2019s most thrilling and compelling voices.", "title": "The Age", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799002-the-age", "average": 3.58, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383888759l/15799002.jpg", "reviews": 24, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6560843.Nancy_Lee", "name": "Nancy  Lee"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Apocalyptic", "Cultural", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799002-the-age", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829259.Dead_Girls"]}
