My favourite part is the Radical Thoughts on Motivation section. I go back to it from time to time and read them again to give myself a little jolt of inspiration. One thing I will say is that it does not help you find out what your purpose it, but if you have an idea about what your passions are if can really push you forward from that starting point. I highly recommend this book."}], "description": "Tired of looking for motivation outside of yourself?Disappointed when you don't 'feel' motivated to build your dream life?This book shows you another way to go about it.
