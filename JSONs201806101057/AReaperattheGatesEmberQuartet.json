So I'm seeing lots of turmoil in my feed but I thought I'd pop in. I'm not crazy about switching covers/etc in a series either, but before you go off on a huge tangent, go check out Sabaa's reasoning for the changes. My thoughts on the design/etc don't matter, and I happened to adore the old covers SO much, but this woman did a cool thing with her influence, and I'm so glad I know why!

The better for an epic love story.\n\"All things have a price, Elias Veturius. The price of saving her will haunt you for all your days. Will you pay it?\"\nHowever.

That's what I thought.We're both rational book [boyfriend] loving gals who could kick it around town whilst singing the praises of all our favorite men and the peril they go through to save their true loves.Because that's all it is, right? A story? You'd never actually hurt my baby Elias (my book husband (among many, but this is neither here nor there), thank you)-it's all for the beauty of the story and the theatrics of it all.So we'll continue to have these wholly fictional chats over drinks, over nights out on the town, over coffee (or, in my case, Mountain Dew)...But if you so much as hurt a hair on my Elias's precious little head (more so than you already have), our alliance is severed and I cut all ties to our fictional friendship.I'm sorry, but rules are rules, and you can't double cross a friend after you [fictionally] promised to keep a character safe. You can't double cross on the safety of a loved one.So-Here's hoping you choose to do the SMART thing. The RATIONAL thing. Don't make me abduct you for ransom. I don't want to have to do this-you don't want me to have to do that, do you? Of course you don't.
