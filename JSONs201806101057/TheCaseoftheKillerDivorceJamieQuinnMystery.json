It fell a little short of a 4 because it's not quite a traditional cozy mystery or romance mystery given there's very little romance and a small cast of characters involved in the murder. But it had some good fun, quirky characters and sharp dialogue so it was better than a 3 in my world. (I rarely give out a 5 just to set the scale).\nStory\nJamie's a family law attorney who took off a couple of years when her mother passed away. In the first book in the series, she's thrust into a criminal case to save her cousin, but in this second book, she's helping her client Becca get through what seems like a rough divorce from her husband Joe -- that is, until Joe turns up dead from an overdose of Becca's sleeping pills hidden in a Tylenol bottle. Did Joe accidentally kill himself? Was it Becca hoping to ensure she retained fully custody of their children? Or was it Becca's new boyfriend (and previously a good friend of Joe's) trying to get the ex out of the picture? In this short novella, readers experience drama both in and out of the courtroom with this case, including Jamie's budding friendships with the DA Nick and PI Duke. Throw in her Aunt Peg and her criminal lawyer best friend Grace and Jamie's got tons of folks to help her get through her re-acclimation to the legal world. But in this book, we learn Jamie never knew her father and is looking to find out more about him. When she stumbles upon a few leads, and a gift from her late mother, Jamie's world begins to turn upside down as she embraces all sorts of change in her life.\nStrengths\nFor a novella, there is a lot of action and multiple side-stories packed into the plot. It's quick-paced and you'll find yourself enjoying the read in about 60 to 90 minutes -- perfect for when you can't fall asleep quickly but are afraid to start an entire new 300 page novel that threatens to keep you awake all night! The characters are funny and the easy dialogue makes you feel like you're talking to or reading about a friend. It's simple and straightforward without any fluffy language that attempts to send you off into complex literary bliss -- which is a good thing when you just want a fun little mystery to solve.\nSuggestions\nI am not sure I'd call it a mystery though! There is certainly an element of \"who killed Joe\" and \"will Jamie find her father\" but if you're a traditional cozy mystery buff, this may seem out of character. It's still a good story, but doesn't have a cast of 5 or 6 characters who could be the killer, and you don't get a lot of clues to try to figure it out yourself. I'd like to see maybe one more potential suspect to build up a little more suspense and reader involvement in the story (but that's just me!).\nFinal Thoughts\nI enjoy the series. It's fun and easy to read. Jamie seems very real and Duke is a blast. I can hear his accent and see him parading around whenever he's in a scene. I look forward to watching this series build and grow into a more substantial story.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Don't get me wrong, as a family law attorney, I've delivered plenty of bad news to clients before, but it's never easy. And how exactly do you tell someone they're a murder suspect? Is there a class on that? A website?\u201dJamie Quinn is back, trying to help an old friend with an unfriendly divorce. Jamie is not a criminal lawyer but a family law court lawyer, so she\u2019s out of her depth (again) when Becca turns to her for help.\u201cThey say that criminal lawyers see bad people on their best behavior and divorce lawyers see good people at their worst, and it's true.While working on Becca\u2019s case, not Becca's divorce but her being a murder suspect, Jamie is looking for her father, whom she's never met. Meanwhile, she bumps into an old boyfriend. Oh happy day! So her narrative goes back and forth between the case, the search, and handsome Kip who wants to take her horseback riding. She's been a bit down after losing her mother not long ago, and wondering about who her father was, but now she is happily reminiscing about Kip and lifeguarding at the pool in their youth to the extent that she practically drools and decides to research horsemanship. Ever onwards, Jamie!There seems to be a lot more extraneous chat and banter in this than in the first book, but I'm sure fans will enjoy Jamie's enthusiasm and humour as she waffles on about this and that. The first two in the series are short, quick reads, and I know there are three more longer ones out, too. Thanks to the author for a copy for review."}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "Jamie Quinn is a divorce lawyer who finally was able to come back to her practice after the events in the first book. Her current case: a typical divorce. A husband and a wife have bitter feud which resulted in divorce which left the wife with a lover, two daughters and a house while the husband gets to pay alimony and see his daughters every Friday. The wife thinks once a week time with his daughters is too much for her ex and continues the legal battle, but fortunately for her the guy was nice enough to drop dead. Unfortunately for her, she is the prime suspect. Jamie became tangled in the mystery. She also received a first clue about the identity of her father she never knew. She now has two mysteries on her hands. The old gang of the first books is back. The infamous PI Duke Broussard still has some amusing lines to say. However this installment is much more serious than the previous one with practically all the humor gone. On the positive side, Jamie gets nice development as a character and we learn quite a lot about her origins at the same time she does. I rate this book slightly lower than the first one due to aforementioned lack of humor which worked nicely to lighten the serious mood. It is still fast and entertaining read, 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8085705-vicki", "userReview": "Once again I Gert to see insomniac Jamie take on a case and have it begin to go south.

Becca was desperate to retain custody of their two girls and wanted Joe nowhere near them. But the judge said otherwise; Jamie had to convince Becca it was for the best and would work out fine for her and the girls, plus their dad. When suddenly there was an unexpected death, followed by an accusation from the public prosecutor, Jamie was shocked to find her client as a murder suspect.Immediately enlisting the help of Private Investigator Duke Broussard, a friend and former client, to search for and find the truth of innocence or guilt, Jaimie also reminded Duke about the search for her father. Jaimie had never known her dad and after reading a letter from her mother, who had passed away eighteen months previously, she was more than ever determined to locate him. Beyond that, she hadn\u2019t thought\u2026 When Jaimie bumped into a person she hadn\u2019t seen for a number of years; a person she had been extremely close to way back then, she was delighted. And it seemed Kip was happy to see her as well. Jaimie\u2019s life was turning full circle at last \u2013 after her mother\u2019s death when she couldn\u2019t lift herself out of her grief \u2013 she had her friendship with best friend Grace; her practice was doing well; the search for her father was (hopefully) progressing; and now she\u2019d found Kip...But what would happen with Jaimie\u2019s client? And what would happen in her personal life? The Case of the Killer Divorce is the second in the Jaimie Quinn mysteries, and I loved it as much as the first. A quick, easy read; nevertheless it had some unique twists and turns which were (to me) unexpected. I enjoyed the character of Jaimie, and once again I found Duke\u2019s quirky character irresistible. I\u2019m looking forward to reading the third book in the series with great anticipation.

Jamie is back to work as a family law attorney, her client\u2019s husband winds up dead. Again, she is stuck assisting a criminal case and entrusts her contacts from Book 1. In this book we also are introduced to two new characters (Jamie\u2019s dad and a love interest).It is a novella, and reads very quickly: it could have been longer and I wouldn\u2019t have minded that as I like the characters she creates. I don\u2019t think it was rushed per se, just more effort to leave us hanging at spots in the story would have worked. All this is because I like Jamie\u2019s character and enjoy reading the author\u2019s work. You don\u2019t have to read Book 1 to understand Book 2: but I don\u2019t recommend reading Book 2 as a standalone.

No family members to defend this time around. But as luck or misfortune would have it, the murder suspect just happens to be a client that she is representing in a divorce case. And the real murderer is much closer than anyone could ever imagine. Will Jamie and her P.I. partner in crime, Duke, be able to solve this mystery before more than an ending marriage is on the chopping block? Read this book and find out!What I liked about the story: \u2022It\u2019s all about that pace, bout that pace, bout that pace, no trouble! Love it! \u2022All the amazing teamwork between Jamie, Grace (Jamie\u2019s best bud), and Duke(flirty P.I.) when it comes down to researching and looking up info on Jamie\u2019s dad. Don\u2019t even think the C.I.A. could find out all the information that they did that quickly. Was truly great.\u2022Jamie isn\u2019t as \u201chardened\u201d as I once thought that she is, which is great. But she is still a mystery wrapped in an enigma, surrounded by a riddle so to speak, lol. But I\u2019m not annoyed about it just more curious where she will end up.\u2022Finally her mom\u2019s cat is liking her! Was sweet when the cat curled up near her in bed.What I didn\u2019t like about the story:\u2022Still can\u2019t quite pinpoint why Jamie and her aunt and cousin aren\u2019t closer. I would think that given how close her mom and aunt were. Jamie and her cousin would have been back and forth over each other\u2019s houses and have more of a bond. Even Jamie look to her aunt as someone to get advice from. But there is quite the distance between them for some reason.\u2022For best buds and how close Jamie and Grace are. I felt Grace was very \u201cWhere is Carmen Santiago?\u201d In this one. I get they are both busy lawyers/career women. But in this day and age/even the first book, they were like glued at the hip through texts. Now it\u2019s like they make plans sooo far into the weekend ahead at times, it\u2019s like they NEVER hope to get time to hang out during the week. But given that wasn\u2019t the case, I don\u2019t get why it happened like that a few times.\u2022Sudden pop up of info again (in this case, Jamie\u2019s ex, Grace\u2019s interests in community outreach, etc.) Just would love a little lead into information about this stuff. Otherwise it doesn\u2019t feel like it really connects to anything and just Jamie\u2019s random facts about the world around her.Would I recommend this book?:Totally. Jamie and her world only gets richer as you go along and it\u2019s really interesting to see what her and her team come up with next. :)"}, {"userName": "Sabine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1633761-sabine", "userReview": "And once again I wish it would have been longer!

She\u2019s handling cases that she\u2019s trained for (mostly divorces) until someone ends up dead and her divorce client is a suspect. Once again, folks turn to Jamie to untangle a murder mystery. She calls in her associate, an annoying man who just happens to be good at his job as a private eye, Duke Broussard. To add to the mess, Jamie wishes to find her long lost father, or at least, learn a bit more about him. As with Book 1 in the series, this mystery is set in modern day Hollywood, Florida.I think I enjoyed this book even more than Book 1 because there were two plot lines; the main plot followed the murder investigation and the minor plot was the search for info on Jamie\u2019s father. Plus there was a little side romance that added to the story and was not distracting from the main plot. The story starts with a judge dismissing Jamie\u2019s motion in a divorce case. Becca and Joe have 2 kids and now Becca has to allow Joe to see them on Friday. She has a bit of a melt down when Joe, once again, threatens to sue for sole custody of the kids. Plenty of nasty things are said back and forth and one of these lovely people ends up dead.The story was easy to get into and it was quite fun riding around in Jamie\u2019s head as she tried to solve the murder mystery, while at the same time untangling the mystery of her long lost father. Duke Broussard alternately irritates Jamie and perks her up. He\u2019s a good friend, even if he can be a bit annoying at times. I really enjoyed the back and forth between these two. While the ending was a little predictable, this is a great read for day off in a porch swing, or curled up by a fire.The Narration: Martz once again was a good voice for Jamie.

Normally I like to space out my series reading so as not to get too burned out on any one series but in this case, the very nature of these stories made it easy to progress right to the second one.After the first book, Jamie now finds herself working full time once again and has been representing one of the parties in a divorce case. It isn\u2019t long before a murder occurs and Jamie\u2019s client is suspected. But while dealing with that, Jamie\u2019s personal life takes center stage with two subplots involving her search for her biological father as well as a chance encounter with an old flame.Once again, there is a lot to enjoy with these books, not the least of which is the light-hearted, humorous style in which they are written. I find the character of Jamie Quinn to be delightful and I enjoy rooting for her to succeed. I also love the interaction she has with her PI helper and former client, Marmaduke \"Duke\" Broussard. The end of this book leaves Jamie in a very happy place in her life and I hope that is sustained for her.

Another good story. I relate to Jamie with her private dealings! The author gave specific details on finding a parent. She makes me want to find my biological parents. But I digress. About the client. You could almost tell that something wasn't right with her at the end of the hearing. You just knew. Know what I mean? At least I could. Anyway, as you read further you can tell by the clients mood swings that something is not right with her. It was a good read! I loved it! The author describes many areas in the book, and it's detailed. You can almost imagine yourself there. And, she shows in the book that even attorneys have feelings about their own clients. And that they also (at least some of them) wonder if their client is innocent or guilty. And whether they are morally responsible for representing them. Also, sorry if I don't give a synopsis of the book in better detail."}, {"userName": "Chrissy (The Every Free Chance Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3435480-chrissy-the-every-free-chance-reader", "userReview": "4.5 starsDid I enjoy this book: If you\u2019re looking for the perfect book to read while relaxing by the pool sipping some fruity drink with an umbrella peeking over the side, this is it.Clever and comical, The Case of the Killer Divorce has romance, murder, mental breakdowns, and even a search for the main character\u2019s long lost father. Many of the same lovable characters that solved crimes in Death by Didgeridoo are back. They work together to discover how a man in a contentious divorce ends up unexpectedly dead.I have to go with 4\u00bd stars out of 5 because I don\u2019t like the ending. For me, it\u2019s too abrupt.Would I recommend it: Yes.

Her latest case is an acrimonious divorce battle which turns into a murder investigation when the soon to be ex-husband is found dead. Meanwhile, Jamie is trying to locate her long-lost father with the help of Duke Broussard, a private investigator and friend she\u2019s also hired to help investigate the murder. In addition, Jamie has run into an old boyfriend and is going out with him to see if there are any sparks which still exist. As with the previous Jamie Quinn mystery, THE CASE OF THE KILLER DIVORCE is a very light mystery with humorous elements. Jamie\u2019s a very likeable character and I enjoy her escapades. If you\u2019re looking for a light-hearted cozy mystery, pick up THE CASE OF THE KILLER DIVORCE."}, {"userName": "Bertha", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4229822-bertha", "userReview": "Jamie Quinn is back in book two of the series.
