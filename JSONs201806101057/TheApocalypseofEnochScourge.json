It's an easy read that keeps you entertained. You want to know what's going to happen next. I have read each book in a day, because I didn't want to put it down. Life doesn't let that happen. I enjoy the fact that it's not just another slasher/porn story. Honestly, the way this book ended kind of pissed me off. It's absolutely worth the read. Now book 3."}, {"userName": "John R.
