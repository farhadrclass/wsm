I love Michael and Julia's love story and how they helped each other get over some major hurdles yet enjoyed a sweet romance leading up to Christmas. Michael\u2019s little puppy, Sweets, helped Julia open up to him as a new neighbor while Julia\u2019s warm spirit and caring nature helped Michael believe love was possible again. Meanwhile, the food, wine, desserts and Italian flavor lent an air of authenticity and anticipation for the wonderful Christmas season coming up.A sweet and enchanting love story that reminds you Christmas is the season of hope and renewal.I read an ARC provided to me by the author."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6169581-sharon", "userReview": "I loved this story.

This short story is one that reads just like a made for TV Holiday movie and I don't mean that in a bad way at all! I love these types of stories. I was rooting for Julia to find her happiness in whatever that would be. I was so anxious to find out what happened next that I loved that this was a short story. This is a great 4 star book to read on a cold afternoon in between shopping online and baking. polishedandbubbly.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24621901-megan", "userReview": "Well that was the quickest 100 odd pages I've ever read. And unfortunately boring too. She is a spoiled little brat and her father is a pompous rich man. Basically they're rich and flaunting it from the look of everything.Sorry I really didn't enjoy this book or the chapters on different points of view."}, {"userName": "Vanessa Hillmann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61686211-vanessa-hillmann", "userReview": "I know this is just a novella and therefore quite short and I'm usually okay with that, but this time I feel like there was too much of the lovestory simply missing because it happened in the days left out between the chapters. I just couldn't feel the characters falling in love with each other. That's a pity because I actually Iiked them both and the idea of the story was also good. Her father was a great character too, protecting his daughter before she even knew what an idiot her husband was.However, what was a little annoying was that whenever the characters did something like dressing it was described in too much detail for my taste. I actually skipped a few sentences everytime..."}, {"userName": "Trudy Gleason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42644311-trudy-gleason", "userReview": "Cute book - thoroughly enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682283-barb", "userReview": "Christmas is no joy for Julia whose gambling husband comes around only to ask for money.
