Every story is so wound up in being this little jewel like thing that you could present at a writing workshop that it forgets to have a point, a meaning, and worst of all an ending. Each one trails off into the mist, leaving you feeling like, huh? what just happened? where was this going? Confusion is not mystery, art is not the act of making things impenetrable.

Karen Russell is clearly a very gifted writer and several of these short stories approach masterful, but here is the problem - I don't think she knows how to finish a story. Each one of these little gems is unique and unlike any other story in the book - indeed, the style of the story varies wildly and wonderfully from story to story. Each story begins as a wonderfully weird little idea gem and Russell wraps that idea in layer upon layer of delicious prose, fleshing out the idea and creating fantastic and fascinating little worlds. With only one exception (the awful failed experiment of DOUGBERT SHACKLETON'S RULES FOR ANTARCTIC TAILGATING) the reader has a great time exploring each of the little worlds that Russell creates until the very end, when too often...nothing happens. Short stories (well, ANY story actually), is supposed to have a beginning, middle and end; the end should be some resolution to the conflict or antagonism that was created in the first two sections. Russell does a great job of carrying the ball downfield but then stops short of the goal line. As an example, my favorite story in the collection is PROVING UP, a young boy's amazing, journey through the haunted frontier of early 19th century American settlers that races along intermittently thrilling and terrifying until what would seem to be the logical conclusion is left up to the reader's imagination to decide what happened to the protagonist. After reading the last page three or four times I wanted to throw the book across the room - Russell doesn't need to make the endings of stories intentionally vague - it comes across as quasi-intellectual gamesmanship. The author draws from a deep and expressive and entertaining well of creativity to pull the reader along and set them up for a huge emotional payoff and then...\"No - you are going to have to figure this out for yourselves\". PROVING UP was, for me, the worst offender in terms of lack of conclusion, however THE SEAGULL ARMY DESCENDS ON STRONG BEACH, 1979 was, after a great emotional investment in the wonderfully drawn characters, another tremendous disappointment, as was the title story, VAMPIRES IN THE LEMON GROVE, which also suffered from being terminally precious and somewhat cloying. REELING FOR THE EMPIRE was probably the most bizarre and successful story in the collection - young girls are tricked into a kind of slave labor in feudal era Japan by signing on to spin silk, but in actuality, are transformed into human silkworms. Although the conclusion was not entirely satisfying, it seemed to fit the otherworldly atmosphere of the story, as did THE BARN AT THE END OF OUR TERM, in which dead US Presidents are reincarnated as horses in a stable and converse and interact as equine versions of themselves - bizarre and trippy and not altogether unsatisfactory, although disappointing. In the two most conventional stories in the collection, THE NEW VETERANS and THE GRAVELESS DOLL OF ERIC MUTIS, Russell writes fully developed characters that are identifiable and relatable and has them evolve and act logically, but again, the conclusions to these stories are frustratingly obscure and the reader is left with a sense of \"Yeah - but what did any of it MEAN?\". I suppose that several of these stories might make for interesting book club discussions, but I think most readers will describe the same frustrations as I do. Russell is a brilliant writer, but these stories come across as intentionally obtuse, as if Russell realizes that the reader will be forced to create their own conclusions and/or debate the meaning of hers. Readers of short fiction will quickly grow weary of such intellectual hide-and-seek."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "I was delighted by this collection of weird and wonderful stories. Almost as sprightly as Murakami and sometimes leaning toward the flavor of Annie Proulx\u2019s gothic tall tales and encounters with supernatural in her collections on the American West. In the title story an ancient married couple, who happen to be immortal vampires, live among the gentry immigrated to Sorrento in sunny Italy. Magred and Clyde keep up a refined banter worthy of the anti-heroes in Pulp Fiction. At the end of the day overseeing their fruit grove they take special pleasure of a daily cocktail hour with their harvest of fresh lemons. They have learned from trial and error over the centuries that certain drinks can slake their rapacious lust for blood:We spent our honeymoon hopping continents, hunting liquid chimeras: mint tea in Fez, coconut flurries in Oahu, jet-black coffee in Bogota, jackal\u2019s milk in Dakar, cherry coke floats in rural Alabama, a thousand beverages purported to have quenching properties.But we learn with a bit of comic flair that there are challenges keeping a marriage fresh for so many decades. And we let loose with some dark garnish in the cocktail that assures us that no simple psychochemistry can really tame a vampire\u2019s natural ways. Fun and spooky at the same time.A few elements of the situation of my favorites can give you a perspective on the range in these stories while revealing a convergence on a marriage of the comic weird and spooky weird:In The New Veterans. a massage therapist for veterans of the Iraq War with PTSD becomes obsessed with helping a survivor of an IED attack who has the story tattooed on his back. In apparent homage to Bradbury, the relationship between the tale she draws from the man has a changing relationship with that in the tattoo. I love how the therapist narrator\u2019s own story gives her a vested interest in healing this man. Just as a reader is changed by grappling with different takes on a story, I got some zings as I channeled her struggle to deal with varying interpretations of the man and his tattoo while neither seemed to hold to a clear pattern.In The Barn at the End of Our Term we get the daffy scenario of the spirit-minds of dead presidents relegated to an eternal horse farm. Nice opportunity to explore what presidents from different eras would have to say to each other. In a situation where all stripped down to a limited channel of being in the present, where all accomplishments of the past become a matter of historical memory or assertion, and the future kind of frozen and fuzzy.. Which president do you figure would get most wound up to escape somehow (and God knows to where)? A whimsy you can get carried away with, at least until the imaginary solidity of the ice gets thin.Among amazing but somewhat less favored stories: --one women in Imperial Japan are trying to escape them enslavement as factory workers who not only spin silk, but produce it from their bodies like silkworms--one that features seagulls which are getting involved in messing with the fates of some teenagers in New Jersey--one that tracks the odyssey of an 11-year old boy while on a humanemission for his wheat farmer father in 19th century Nebraska, one beset by phantasms of his dead sisters growing out of the ground and visitations from farmers who came to a bad end--one has some brutal school bullies of a kid with epilepsy experience a Stephen King kind of comeuppance--another one that turns the fight between species in the Anarctic regions into a fantastical and comic international sporting eventI am not deeply experienced in the ways short stories do their magic. I tend to feel short-changed and hungry for a fuller arc about the characters and their story. But collections like this begin to help me appreciate the microcosm of each story, with world building that takes the deftness of crafting a ship in a bottle. And the sense of a window view that implies much that goes beyond the frame. I felt a lot of cleverness here that was more playful and mind-bending rather than smug and profound."}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "Karen Russell seems to have jumped out of nowhere onto the mainstream literary scene with the publication of her first collection of stories St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves in 2006, at the age of 25. Her stories were published in Oxford American, The New Yorker and The Best American Short Stories. Her 2011 novel Swamplandia! was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2012. This is her latest collection of short fiction, which also served as my introduction to her work.Collections of short stories - sometimes I feel as if I am the last person on the planet who not only is interested in them but actually reads these things. It's as if the market for short fiction was completely overtaken by magazines, where they appear individually, and anthologies - where they appear collectively. I'm afraid that we have reached the time when volumes of short fiction by a single author are bordering on extinction, like single empty islands in the vast sea of novels. Discovering great stories is like finding a precious pearl inside an oyster. Discovering a collection filled great stories is like finding an oyster bursting with such pearls, each different from the other.I am glad to report that Karen Russel delivers the goods in her latest collection, which an Amazon editor described as the descendant of Ray Bradbury's The October Country, \"if that book had been written in the throes of a fever dream\". The comparison with Bradbury is not entirely without justification. I read The October Country just after finishing this collection (review coming up!) and loved Bradbury's gentle storytelling, and his wonderful imagination. The stories in Vampires in Lemon Grove can be traced back to Bradbury - but then what in this kind of writing can't? What's more important are the stories themselves - they are the polished little darlings one might expect to roll out from a writer's workshop, but written by a student who spent most of their youth reading the science fiction paperbacks purchased at a drugstore (the ones which had two novels in one book were the best - when you got to the middle you could just flip it over and have a completely different story!), along with a selection of paperback westerns and horror fiction and other stuff they would stay to read up late, with eyes glued to the paper and cheeks red with emotion.Russel's stories are imaginative and bright, and most of all feature ideas which are original and entertaining. In the title story we'll find Clyde and Magreb, an ancient vampire couple which has hunted for centuries for something which would quench their thirst for human blood; they find solace in a small Italian village, where they discover that sucking lemon juice seems to do the trick. But does it? The marriage between Clyde and Magreb is struggling, as she desires a change in their habits while Clyde prefers things the way they are - or is is simply unable to change. Far from the vampire cheese we are now served so often, the story is a great opener - it's offhand and funny, while at the same time being reflective and melancholic, the well-known theme of disappointments in a long (in this case century long) marriage with a twist.The second story, Reeling for the Empire, moves from sun-drenched Italy of now to feudal Japan at the height of the Empire, where rapid industrialization is seen as the only means of keeping up with other great powers, and Japan adopts the methods and exploitation of industrialized - and powerful - Western nations. An imperial agent travels through the poor, rural country, seeking young women willing to spin silk for a small salary. In this society such money would do wonders, so it's not uncommon that their fathers (the women in question have little to say) agree to send their daughters into factories far away. A story like this could easily turn into a sentimental piece meaning to emphasize the exploitation of workers (and the oppression and subjugation of women) toiling in sweatshops - think The Grapes of Wrath in 19th century Japan. Bur Russel puts her own imaginative twist on the story, which writers of literary realism would shy away from: she makes her agent \"turn\" the young weavers, and have them produce silk from their own bodies. A machine extracts the precious fiber from their fingers, and their lives are ultimately reduced to oscillating around this process. Like Kafka's Gregor Samsa they become something entirely different from what that they used to be, and are forced to adjust their lives accordingly. But there's a second catch here: Russel has her protagonist, Kitsune, join the factory out of her own free will, as opposed to secondary characters which were all drawn in by deceit, trickery and force. Like Gregor, Kitsune also acts as the narrator, bringing an uniquely personal angle to this story and shifting the focus to her own individual self, whereas in sentimental fiction even the most interesting protagonists always stand in for greater ideas. Kitsune's journey towards self-discovery is wonderfully done and her transformation is beautiful and strange.Shades of Kafka are more clearly visible in Proving Up, which pays homage to the stories of pioneers who settled the Old West. With elements of Western intermixed with American gothic, it's the most straight-up horror piece in the entire collection. The premise revolves around the legendary Homestead Act, which literally gave away hundreds of acres of land to people who asked for it for little or no cost at all. Hovewer, the homesteaders had another price to pay: they had to fight the isolation in a remote and uncivilized parts of their country, struggle with difficult farming in seemingly everpresent drought and a very real danger of attack by various Indian tribes which weren't too happy about the land they inhabited and fought over for centuries being taken away from them by these new people - everyday inconveniences of life at the frontier. Russel sets her story in the fictional Hox River Settlement in Nebraska, and again puts her own unique twist on the well-explored topic: in order to be allowed to keep their 160 acres of land, the homesteaders need to \"prove up\" to the federal inspector by showing him that they have a real glass window in their house. The trouble is that there are perilously little windows or glass on the flat prairies, and three families have only one window - and plot to fool the inspector by quickly transporting it between their houses as he comes. The anxiety with waiting for the inspector and stress of dealing with the absurd and unnecessary bureaucracy is all too familiar and reminds us of Josef K's trials and tribulations, and the trial of young Miles Zegner - the best rider of the family, and the person selected to bring the window around when the inspector comes - his dreamlike, hypnotic and eerie journey through the wild and strange prairie land, seemingly without end, brought to my mind another of Kafka's great pieces - The Country Doctor.There's also The New Veterans, a story about Beverly and Derek - a masseuse and a veteran. Beverly believes that bodies have an unique language which can be explored only by touch, and when a recent government bill allows access for US veterans to massage therapists she meets Derek Zeiger, a troubled Iraqi vet with a beautiful but grim tattoo on his back - Iraqi landscape with an explosion of red in the center, his friend's death day. Derek is in much pain - physical and emotional - as he is unable to shed the thought that he is responsible for his death. Both hesistant at first, however they begin to lean towards one another, each for their respective reasons. Here Russel weaves a really quite beautiful story of healing and scars left by war, told like an episode of The Twilight Zone, as Derek's stress and strain escape his body and seem to latch onto Beverly, whose desire to help others is at once selfless and selfish. The tension here is incredible despite its quiet, hushed tone, and makes it one of the strongest pieces in the collection where there are no weak elements.There are two funnies here as well. The first one, Dougbert Shackleton\u2019s Rules for Antarctic Tailgating is a genuinely amusing guidebook for the world's most unlikely sport: tailgating in the unpopulated, frozen wilderness on earth's last corner, fought between Team Whale and Team Krill. It's the shortest story in the whole collection, and an amusing riff on sports commentary and absurd devotion which only sports can generate. Team Krill till I die! The Barn at the End of Our Term is best described as existential satire, as in it forgotten American presidents are reincarnated as horses and live their lives as such, stuck in a barn. President Rutherford Hayes is gobsmacked when he finds himself waking up in a horse's body, but more so when he discovers that several of his horse companions are also former presidents of the U.S.A. - president Eisenhower, president Garfield, president Buchanan, president Jackson.Is death not the end? Why horses, of all animals? Is the barn some sort of purgatory, or is it just an ordinary barn? While pondering all these questions the former presidents compete against one another for important offices, such as the Governor of the Cow Pastures or the Spokeshorse of the Western Territories. The idea is just so impossibly absurd and completely ridiculous, but Russel totally makes it work. Very cool.There are also stories in this collection which do not deal with the fantastical at all, prefering to border on the fringe of the real and possible. Take The Seagull Army Descends on Strong Beach, 1979, where the fourteen year old Nal lives in the shadow of his handsome and charming older brother, trying to find himself and deal with his mother - a forcibly retired nurse, who has given up on life and being any sort of a guiding light for the young, lost teenager. Nal lives on the coast and roams around the beach, noticing the ominous seagulls; he decides to go and explore their nest, and discovers that the gulls have been stealing - and hoarding - various objects from local townspeople. These objects change Nal's life in a profound way, just like Russel's unique twist -not thieving magpies, but thieving seagulls!- on a classic coming-of-age, Holden Caufieldesque story changes it from a staple and makes it her own. The closing story, The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis, recalls the vintage stories of Stephen King and explores the theme of school bullying and its aftermath: a group of school boys are shocked when they discover a damaged scarecrow-like doll which looks like one of their former victims, Eric Mutis - whom they nicknamed The Mutant. Inexplicably, upon seeing the doll the boys are strangled with guilt and recall Eric and his life, putting more thought into their actions and seeking some redemption. But like other of Russel's protagonist they too are lost, with nowhere to go, able only to queue for free lunch and run around the decaying streets of shanty neighborhoods, haunted by that doll which brings back the ghost of victim past.This is a great collection from a writer with a fresh, exciting voice, one to seek out, hold on and look forward to. I can't wait to explore Karen's other collection and read her novel, hoping that she will publish more of her great stories in the near future. Thumbs up!"}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "God damn it, Karen Russell. She's just too good at this, guys, and it's driving me crazy. No one should be able to do what Karen Russell does - her particular brand of magical realism, where the supernatural and suburban America blend seamlessly, is like nothing I've ever encountered before. It just isn't fair that all that talent got concentrated in one person. Vampires in the Lemon Grove is Russell's second collection of short stories - in my review of her first book, St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves, I complained that most of the stories didn't have concrete endings, and often stopped right when they were starting to get good. The writing was gorgeous, the settings and characters were fantastic, but the lack of closure to the stories irritated me. Vampires in the Lemon Grove is infinitely more satisfying, with each of the stories having a much clearer beginning, middle, and end. It's still Karen Russell, of course, so the stories do tend to stop sooner than you want them to, and you sometimes get the sense that Russell doesn't know how to resolve the scenario she's set up, so she opts to leave the ending open for interpretation to avoid having to give us concrete answers. Reviewers who complain about the stories' resolutions have clearly not read St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves. Compared to that, all of the stories presented here are much more organized and complete, and knowing that Russell had improved made this much more enjoyable to read.And god, guys, the stories are so good. There are eight in all, and the only clunker is \"The New Veterans,\" which attempts to address the Iraq war and PTSD, and ends on a sort of treacly note. But it involves a massage therapist figuring out that she can manipulate a soldier's memories through his tattoos, so it was still pretty cool. I had three favorite stories, and they all illustrate what's so great about Russell's writing: in \"Reeling for the Empire,\" girls who are recruited to work in silk factories during the industrialization of Japan are given tea that turns them into silkworm-human hybrids, and they spin silk in their stomachs that's extracted from their fingertips by a machine every day. \"Proving Up\" is about a group of pioneer families struggling to survive while being shadowed by an unknown evil. And my absolute favorite, \"The Barn at the End of Our Term,\" is about a stable where the horses are former US presidents who have died and been transformed into horses, with all their memories of their former lives (our narrator is Rutherford B. Hayes), and it's funny until it takes a hard left turn into Emotionally Devastating Lane and stays there, and suddenly you're wondering why a story about horse presidents is making you want to cry. Such is the power of Karen Russell.\"Several of us claim to be daughters of samurai, but of course there is no way for anyone to verify that now. It's a relief, in a way, this new anonymity. We come here tall and thin, noblewomen from Yamaguchi, graceful as calligraphy; short and poor, Hida girls with bloody feet, crow-voiced and vulgar; entrusted to the Model Mill by our teary mothers; rented out by our destitute uncles - but within a day or two the drink the Recruitment Agent gave us begins to take effect. And the more our kaiko-bodies begin to resemble one another, the more frantically each factory girl works to reinvent her past. One of the consequences of our captivity here in Nowhere Mill, and of the darkness that pools on the factory floor, and of the polar fur that covers our faces, blanking us all into sisters, is that anybody can be anyone she likes in the past.\""}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I had been looking forward to this book coming out, because I loved Karen Russell's first book of short stories, St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves.

While she has always handled both deftly, she made a name for herself by creating fantastical and fabulist scenarios. Those still remain, but the unreal elements of her stories seem subtler, serving to nudge the reader just outside of the possible, to let them see her deeply human narratives from a uniquely revealing angle. That\u2019s because Russell is all about what's human, even if the human is sometimes a scarecrow or a silkworm/woman or a vampire.Despite being a writer of supreme empathy, Russell shows no hesitation in throwing her characters to the wolves. As much as she loves her characters, she loves the story more, and if something awful has to happen for the sake of the story then you can be sure it will. She\u2019s a master of the looming doom, a feeling of foreboding lurking over the horizon. The story \"Proving Up,\" for example, is like reading a slightly surreal Flannery O'Connor.The prose of each story, even if the styles vary, is always controlled, like each letter was set in place with tweezers: \"That sun ate lakes, rising out of dead volcanoes at dawn, triple the size of a harvest moon and skull-white, a grass-scorcher.\" Russell has a way of crafting sentences that feel perfect without letting the reader fall into a preconceived comfort. She excels at creating new linguistic experiences, which require an investment of attention and intellect.The most important part of this collection and all of Russell's writing is, for me, the childlike glee with which she explores her subjects. Even in stories where \"glee\" seems like the absolute wrong word to describe them, it's hard not to feel her own wonder at the weirdness of her subjects. With all the elements that I might quantify, it's this verve, elan, whatever you want to call it that makes Vampires in the Lemon Grove transcend literary expectations. These are stories that you'll remember long after most others are forgotten."}, {"userName": "Laurel Beth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069076-laurel-beth", "userReview": "Karen Russell is in heat check mode. After the Pulitzer committee decided in 2011 that no great novels made the cut for the award (itself a pathetic heat check, the flailing of an organization disguised as stunting), Russell went ahead and planted her talent somewhere in Florida and here in this collection. Do you think the Pulitzer committee just thought, \"Naw, that Swamplandia! is set in America's wang. I love a drive-thru pharmacy with a prescribing NP hanging out the window like it's a Benzedrine Brew-Thru, but we cannot debase ourselves by acknowledging it even exists.\"So here we have Russell, silencing the cloistered brain-trust of literary culture. Basically, she just out-Saundered George Saunders. Here we find teenage girls dosed in the parallel timeline to spin silk from their fingers. There are mediocre presidents reincarnated as horses, ineffectual as ever. Always the painful demonstrative formative experience, \"you're a man now\" breaks in the lifecycle. Sorry George. I didn't obsess over your new book to the point where I took in in the shower cause I couldn't stop reading. Your move, acolytes of Atwood and Carver.I had to skip one story because Karen Russell has no problem lauding our greatest animals only to kill them off. It's the expression of Sedaris' Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk, in which the greatest disconsolate scenarios of Raymond Carver et al. reappear in the fauna. And while my heart aches for the drunk and despair of men, when it's an elephant or a mouse I can't even continue. No logic, no lies, just love.In the last story there appears a rabbit at the tail end, a best friend for a lonely boy. You know how that ends.

I don't really have a problem with her writing technique per se - she can come up with good ways to describe things and there aren't any dumb sentences in here or anything - it's just that a lot of these stories don't end up being very interesting or compelling, with a few exceptions. All of these stories involve somewhat fantastical elements, which is fine, but the less-interesting ones read like weird workshop exercises, like \"now write a story where horses are Presidents\".- Vampires in the Lemon Grove. A long-married vampire couple has been living in Italy and eating lemons to ameliorate their bloodlust, but eventually the wife wants to move on from their idyll and the husband struggles to cope. I thought this story was pretty bland, like you finish reading and all you can remember is \"yeah, that certainly was about vampires or old people or something\".- Reeling For the Empire. Japanese girls are drugged with a kind of tea that turns them into human silkworms, locked up in a sort of Lowell mill/prison, and forced to spin silk for export until they learn how to take the next step in their transformation. Genuinely disturbing, and an excellent example of fantasy horror done well, especially in how emotionally deadened the protagonist was.- The Seagull Army Descends On Strong Beach, 1979. A young teenager in a white trash family struggles to escape his life and get with a girl who's been sort of seeing his brother, crossed with a sci-fi version of Hitchcock's The Birds. I liked the emotional drama in the protagonist's life - my soft spot for stories about uncool high schoolers struggling with love and loserdom, I guess - but the \"magical\" part with the birds possibly messing with humanity by stealing their stuff felt like an afterthought, poorly developed and integrated with the main plot.- Proving Up. The youngest son of a family struggling to settle on the Great Plains is sent on horseback to show a real glass window to the government inspector, which is the final proof needed to receive their title to the land under the Homestead Act; however, the window the father acquired under shady circumstances is attractive to other figures who live along the son's path to the inspector. The son's dreams are maybe a bit too much foreshadowing, but I liked the atmosphere of the story, and he labors under a fairly convincing cloud of dread. I also learned that the glass window requirement was a real thing, which seems really cruel to pioneer families.- The Barn at the End of Our Term. Rutherford B. Hayes, along with several other former Presidents, are reincarnated as horses, and try to figure out if they're in Heaven or some sort of bizarre purgatory while they attempt to escape. I confess that the point of this story escaped me; it reminded me a bit of David Foster Wallace's stupid short story about Lyndon B. Johnson in that both stories are sort of mocking the retrospective gravitas that history awards to Presidents, but I liked Russell's more since it was so openly absurd. The ending was almost existentialist, like a Sartre of the stables.- Dougbert Shackleton's Rules For Antarctic Tailgating. A veteran tailgater provides tips for cheering on Antarctic krill in the battle of life against their archrivals the whales. Short and goofy, it's hard to say much about this. The idea of people cheering on different species in their Darwinian struggle is worth at least a small grin.- The New Veterans. A single Wisconsin masseuse gives massages to a returning Iraq War veteran with a strange tattoo inspired by a fatal IED incident, who responds strangely to her treatment. The masseuse is decently characterized, and I thought her struggle with the soldier's memories was unique and well-done. Maybe this story could have been expanded, but it ends well.- The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis. The leader of a gang of high school delinquents torments a boy who just moved into town and who is somehow connected to an oddly compelling scarecrow. My main issue with this story is that the narrator is not believable at all - that type of bully character would never think of describing themselves as having \"pontoon loads\" of relatives, or some of the other metaphors he comes up with. Also his reaction to the mysterious happenings with the scarecrow aren't very plausible either. Or the way the rest of his gang interacts with him. And his struggles with his last name are dumb. Come to think of it I didn't like anything about this one."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "Russell Proves Up\u201cThe Lemon Grove\u201d is an inventive group of short stories. There are some real gems in this collection. It is one of those books that defy genre categorization. Russell\u2019s style is very literary though you certainly don\u2019t have your feet planted in the everyday world. There are elements of fantasy and science fiction and horror. Also, she has a knack for putting sentences and thoughts together in an individual way. Here are a few examples: \u201c{She} read books and moved through the world as if she were afraid her footsteps might wake it.\u201d \u201cOutside of my mind I can barely see.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a rumor\u2026he\u2019s smoke\u2026\u201d These are a few examples. At a certain point I put my pencil down and just read.There\u2019s a winged motif running through most of these stories if, at times, only on the periphery\u2026bats, seagulls, moths even angels. These multiple references to flying tie in with the fanciful nature of Russell\u2019s writing. There\u2019s also sadness. She confronts loss, unrequited love, a warrior\u2019s battle scars, and unknown unknowable evil, evil that\u2019s made worse for being undefined, etc. Though all these stories have merit I found them uneven. \u2018Proving Up\u2019 was positively creepy as was \u2018The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis\u2019 and \u2018Reeling for the Empire\u2019 read like an allegory. All of them were beyond normal happenings but there was something fundamentally true and human in them. The supernatural aspects in Russell\u2019s writing reminded of Shirley Jackson. Russell\u2019s tone often had William Trevor\u2019s emotional intensity where evil seems to hover just outside reality. The best stories in this collection were immensely satisfying which made those that were less so seem more starkly lacking though probably if I\u2019d encountered them elsewhere I wouldn\u2019t have felt this so strongly.

She too throws reality out the window if it gets in the way of her storytelling. She invests her characters with strange powers and physical deformities that defy natural laws. She writes strong women and young people and skewers traditions and politics effortlessly. But, I have to be honest, I came to this collection with a bad taste in my mouth from Swamplandia!, which was decidedly underwhelming for me.Now I think I might be a convert. This collection started slow for me, with the title story leaving me cold, but it just kept getting better and now I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I still don\u2019t know how to classify her writing \u2013 is this magical realism? modern fantasy? satire? I\u2019m not sure, but I don\u2019t really care. I know that I was entertained and turned inside out and forced to allow my brain to travel down new paths.I am still, in the words of my friend Diane, \u201ccreeped out\u201d by the story in which young Japanese girls are transformed slowly into silkworms. What I at first took for a sort of political satire turned into an emotionally powerful story that left me reeling at the end. In fact, often times throughout the stories, I was arrested by the rich subtext beneath her bizarre tales. The final tale could easily have suffered the route of a bad horror film. Instead she get to the core of lonely, frightened boys playing at acting tough.\"I hadn't known you could feel so grateful to a friend, for living in fear with you. Fear was otherwise a lonely place.\"Russell possesses such a gift for evoking setting that I had no trouble shifting from Italy to Japan to an inner city playground. Once you accept her odd, interesting, imaginative worlds, it\u2019s much easier to find the humor and truth in her characters.\"Under what circumstance can you imagine sleeping with me? Global apocalypse? National pandemic?...What if we do it immediately after I'd received a lethal bite from a rattlesnake so you could feel confident that I would die soon and tell no one? Can you just quantify for me, in terms of beer, what it would take?\"These stories span the globe, many different eras and a variety of socio-economic conditions, but at their heart, they all investigate lonely people in search of connections.I think I am now ready to go back and read her first story collection and keep an eye open for whatever she has in store for us next."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "Not the best collection of short stories I've ever read, but Karen Russell chooses such imaginative and unusual subject matter that the stories are quickly engaging.Only one story in particular stands out as exceptional though, \"Reeling for the Empire.\" It's haunting and a bit sickening, but incredibly original and should be anthologized.

In this \u2013 and in subsequent \u2013 stories, she manages to capture an essential and universal truth of humankind, wrapped in an unique and unusual package.The best of the collection \u2013in my opinion \u2013 is the spectacular second story, Reeling for the Empire. Ms. Russell imagines a 19th century Japan where girls are contracted as silkworm factory workers with one audacious twist: the girls themselves have transformed into silkworms, spinning thread from their own bellies. This highly descriptive story conjures up visions of today\u2019s third world countries, where mass production trumps humanity and where humans eventually become cogs in the wheel. Ms. Russell writes, \u2018We have no mirrors in Nowhere Mill, and I\u2019ve spent the past few months convinced that we were still identifiable as girls women\u2026it\u2019s only now, watching the Agent\u2019s reaction, that I realize what we\u2019ve become in his absence. I see us as he must: white aces with sunken noses that look partially erased. Eyes inset-huge. Spines and elbows incubating lace for wings.\u201dAnother standout is The Seagull Army Descends on Strong Beach, 1979. In this one, a teenager Nal, who plays second fiddle to his far more charismatic older brother, begins to believe that seagulls are communicating with him through talismanic articles, left in their nest. \u201cIf fate was just a tapestry with a shifting design \u2013 some fraying skein that the gulls were tearing right this second\u2014than Nal didn\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t also find a loose thread, and pull.\u201dEvery one of these tales has lessons to offer. The New Veterans, slightly evocative of Jane Mendelssohn\u2019s excellent American Music, focuses on a massage therapist who believes she can take away a tattooed war veteran\u2019s pain by manipulating the image on his body. Proving Up is a haunting Gothic tale about an 11-year-old boy who discovers what occurs when the land owns you and the window becomes a mirror to your soul. The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis is a sort of horrific mortality tale about bullying. And so on.I closed this book in awe of this young writer\u2019s talent.

If you read Swamplandia! amidst the tide of hype, whether it's from the Pulitzer and 20-under-40 and just generally \"this is a young skilled writer\", and thought \"this is good but I can only take so many awe-inspiring prose runs and incredible similes, plus the ending was dogshit\", like I did, then this is the book for you. Russell kills it, truly. She's got the relentless line-by-line dazzle of an MFA student who actually is worth the tuition but beyond that she reaches toward something more profound about her characters and situations that in a lesser writer's grasp would be pale gimmicks. Check \"Proving Up\", which goes William Gass with a stark threatening 19th-century prairie setting and buttons it up with a truly unsettling ending, or the last story, \"The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis\", about cruel kids and the fucked-up shit they realize all too late they'll have to remember doing. This motherfucker has SKILL. She's LOUSY with it. All that grant money and adulation has the advantage of letting her point this industrial-strength detail sponge and description-conveyer of a brain she's got without the interruption of what most of us are doing in our 20's, i.e. working at jobs we don't love for money that's never quite enough. I wish her the best; the usual jealousy I feel toward similar authors of my age group is lessened quite a bit by this collection. Like I said, SWAMPLANDIA was a real thrill, like getting my brain stoned and making it take a long hot shower, with sensual curls of phrase and a bottomless tank of 'em at that, and the calm assured trust that this, this author, she will control and direct you toward something that makes this book earn its place on your shelf and in your time. And, like I said, it let me the FUCK down at the ending. But this is her 3rd book. And it's fucking good. And I think she's getting better. And as long as she doesn't end up advancing up her own ass like so many enthusiastically feted writers, I'll read anything she makes, and then go jogging so the jealousy can disperse. #fuckyeahKarenRussellThough to be fair, she might not want to write so much in first person 'cause an 11-yr-old Nebraskan boy in the 19th century and a Japanese half-silkworm from some horrifying alternate 20th century and an 12-year-old Jersey boy all sounding the same, with a zillion amazing images and metaphors banging around in each sentence?

I've been known to tear up at the odd film now and again, and certain songs can get me sniffling. Okay, both of those things are understatements. And even TV shows can do it. You know the episode of The Vicar of Dibley where [SPOILER ALERT] Hugo and Alice get hitched, so David is the guy ending up sitting there listening to Geraldine's joke? And at the very end of the sequence, he just looks at her and says, \u201cStay.\u201d? [/SPOILER ALERT] I bawl like a baby. Every time. Hell, I'm tearing up now just thinking about it. But that sort of thing doesn't really ever happen to me with books. I can remember, in forty-odd years of reading, crying at maybe three or four books. I can now add \u201cThe New Veteran,\u201d the penultimate story in Karen Russell's Vampires in the Lemon Grove, to the list.I read Russell's debut story collection, St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves, not long after it came out and, to be frank, was blown away. I gave it five stars. I'm not as stingy with five-star book reviews as I am with five-star movie reviews; I've given less than forty five-star movie reviews in my lifetime (and revised at least two of those downward that I can recall off the top of my head), whereas since the start of my current spreadsheet (June 17, 2007) and factoring in some other books I remember from before that (e.g. St. Lucy's), I've got fifty-four five-star books sitting in front of me right now. But that's still a very small percentage of my overall reading; that's fifty-four five-star books out of 2,325 books read, give or take. (2.3%, for those who don't want to do the math.) Six authors have received more than one five-star review\u2014Stephen King, Major Ragain, Catherynne Valente, Kathe Koja (the current runaway winner with four five-star reviews), Martin McDonagh, and now Karen Russell. Because Vampires in the Lemon Grove shows me something I'm not sure it ever occurred to me Karen Russell could do\u2014she got better. If St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves is \u201c a miracle\u201d, as Ben Marcus asserts on its cover (and I was in 2007, and still am in 2013, inclined to agree), then Vampires in the Lemon Grove is, what a choir of angels singing in exultation? Perhaps.Those of you who have read St. Lucy's will feel right at home here. The magical-realism factor is a little more front-and-center here than it was there; stories like \u201cThe Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis\u201d, in which a scarecrow made in the image of a bullied boy becomes a symbol of atonement for one of his tormentors, or \u201cThe New Veteran\u201d, in which a tattooed landscape of Iraq becomes the means by which a massage therapist changes the dreams of a Sergeant, couldn't work without the magical-realist mechanisms that drive them. (This does mean, of course, that readers who are allergic to Jorge Luis Borges, Alice Hoffman, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, etc., are going to be just as turned off by Karen Russell; tread lightly if magical realism is not your gig.) But, perhaps paradoxically, it also feels more ingrained into Russell's world than it did in St. Lucy's; the Wisconsin winter of \u201cThe New Veteran\u201d seems like the most natural place in the world for magic to happen, and let's face it, if there's a more mundane part of the world than Wisconsin in the middle of winter, I can't think of it. These stories, like many of the others in the collection, are of a piece with St. Lucy's; the quality is solid through and through. And then there are the stories that are even better. \u201cProving Up\u201d, even the ARC I'm working from (which like most ARCs is shot through with those bloody TKs; I don't even have an acknowledgements page so I know what magazines to thank for printing these wonderful nuggets of perfection) mentions that this story, the best in the collection and, arguably, the best short story I've encountered since Richard Christian Matheson's \u201cRed\u201d (which I first read in the late eighties), won the National Magazine Award for Fiction in 2012 when it was still titled \u201cThe Hox River Window\u201d. It's a stunning piece, a period story centered around the quirky clause in the Homestead Act requiring that the prospective homeowner have, in the house that they have built, at least one glass window. (This clause is not fiction; the Homestead Act did indeed require homesteaders who headed west to claim their 160 acres to build shelter that had at least one glass window.) And it's better than anything in St. Lucy's, and I'm not quite sure, still, how Ms. Russell managed that.There's a terrifying possibility here. In the horse racing world, when you get a really, really good three-year-old, one who could be a world-beater, you'll often hear trainers saying \u201cwe haven't seen the bottom of him/her yet.\u201d The hoss hasn't really faced the competition to really dig deep and open up the lungs and uncoil the beast within. I made the assumption, incorrectly and somewhat ridiculously, that because St. Lucy's was such an incredible collection, that we'd seen the bottom of Karen Russell. Now I know I was wrong\u2014and I strongly suspect that even with this collection, we haven't. Which makes me hope we won't be waiting another seven years for her next collection. Buy this for \u201cProving Up\u201d and \u201cThe New Veteran\u201d; the other six stories in this collection are the very delectable icing on their cake. If this doesn't top my best reads of the year list, I will be very surprised. *****"}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663300-tara", "userReview": "What I really admire about Russell is her originality and lack of interest in writing for anyone other than herself. These stories lack any of the typical plots we often find, and many break new ground. The stories that most stayed with me (and I'd give a 5 to), as with Swamplandia!, take you to a landscape you are unfamiliar with: the dust bowl in the Midwest, the lemon groves of Italy, the landscape of Afghanistan through the tattoo on a soldier's back. I love these kinds of settings and she is a master of making our landscapes surreal. However, some stories, her fragmented ones, did nothing for me (she is best in long narratives), and while I enjoyed the creepiness of some of the stories (and what seems to be the return of the Bird Man in one), they draw little emotion out of you. Just low level sadness and anger at the final character in the book. So I am left with admiring her work for the craft, not the emotions or new insights they bring out.

Each story has some kind of a supernatural element, but like the best imaginative fiction, the fantasy elements really serve to enhance the universal human emotions that really form the backbones to each tale. For example, the title story is superficially about a pair of vampires learning that they can slake their thirsts on lemons from a particular grove in an Italian monastery, but it's much more about the heartbreaking dissolution of a marriage, about the things that ease our pain until they don't anymore, about finding someone who can tell us the truth about who we are and then wondering if we only love each other for lack of better options. It's a beautiful and painful story, and almost every other story is equally as powerful. My favorites are one written in the style of a men's magazine article about tailgating etiquette (but, in this case, the tailgating coincides with watching the food chain play out in Antarctica, and behind all the laughs I got from a man who bravely supports the doomed Team Krill every year, I found a moving picture of what it means to support lost causes, especially the lost cause of being rejected by a lover), along with Reeling for the Empire, about women who transform into human silkworms to support their Japanese Empire and learn about the personal and communal strengths that they have not lost in their monstrous transformations. The pieces in this book have a wide variety of geographical settings and literary styles (humor to horror), so every reader should find something appealing here, and the whole collection is united by a strong and thoughtful prose.

I think more than anything and more than any recent books I've read, this one made me want to meet and interview the author. I think I could easily turn into a Belieberish-type (Did I just coin a term?) fan of Karen Russell. (I won't however, because I'm pushing 40 with a wife I adore and three kids. I'm too old for the trappings of fandom.)But yeah, I would love to pick her brain. This is some of the most intelligent writing I've ever read. Clever, inventive, precise, yet still packed with magnetic characters. Not every story was a 5, some were 6's though. 1. Vampires in the Lemon Grove (Title story): This story made the \"Twilight\" phenomenon seem as juvenile as it is. There's so much more to vampires! They're people just like us, and they have restraint, exotic histories, and can hold love for generations. 2. Reeling for the Empire: This was one of my favorites and should be anthologized alongside Poe, Bierce, Chekhov, and de Maupassant. It has that old world feel, as if plucked from the 19th Century. I'm not sure if the story was a metaphor for the current problem of human trafficking, but anyone interested in this horrific problem should read this. I don't want to give anything away, but if you believe there's hope in our world that we can overcome the problems of human slavery and gender equality, this is a work of art. 3. The Seagull Army Descends on Strong Beach, 1979: A love story cross between Junot Diaz and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As a man, I greedily wanted more details, but I learned by this story, Russell has a way of holding back. She'll draw you in, but you're not getting that close. 4. Proving Up: Wow! This one reminded me of Stephen King's short story, \"The Man in the Black Suit\". I'd love to ask the author if King was of any inspiration to her. There's also a Willa Cather (Perhaps the Nebraska setting) feel to the landscape and characters. Not giving away plot points, but this story will leave you proving up and staying up. (Like I said, Stephen King.) 5. The Barn at the End of Our Term: Again, sheer inventiveness. Dead presidents reincarnating into stable horses. Who else could imagine and pull this off in a dozen pages? This story started off somewhat gimmicky, but keep reading, it's just a set-up for the fantastic leap at the end. The last few paragraphs had the thrill of the final straightaway at the Kentucky Derby. 6. Dougbert Shackelton's Rules for Antarctic Tailgating: This was my least favorite. I think you need to know more about Shackelton's exploration story to get the humor. I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be funny. I didn't get it, though. 7. The New Veterans: My favorite story hands down. This is the one that makes me want to meet the author. This is a war story dealing with the issues of Iraqi war veterans. My parents were both Vietnam War veterans, and my brother-in-law is a current officer. My sister works with current veterans and helps with families adjusting back to civilian life. This story was well-researched and spot on. Her use of magic realism (I think that's her thing?) was awe-inspiring. She used the supernatural in a way that didn't detract from the reality of war, but enhanced it like a garnish, as if adding an even brighter ornament to the reverence we have for those that sacrifice their lives in war. 8. The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis: Ok, by this story, I'm convinced that Russell is one of the smartest living writers. Anyone that has the experience of being marginalized during their school years will recognize this story and Eric. She somehow accomplishes the impossible by forcing the reader to sympathize with the bully and the bullied. Perhaps that was the point, but if you want your stories to end cleanly (That's not giving away plot points, is it?), then this will leave you frustrated. Personally, I don't need a clean ending, but if I should ever have the honor of meeting Russell, I'm sure my first question will be, \"What happened to the Mutant?\""}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2906120-vanessa", "userReview": "Very high 3, rounding to 4.At times refreshing, at times surprising... but always unpredictable. Never have I read a short story collection by a single author with such diversity in genre, tone and subject matter. Supernatural, humorous, sci-fi, western, horror, historical... it's all in here. I didn't love every story, but as I read along, I knew the next story was going to be the polar opposite of what I just finished. For better or for worse, enjoy the ride. You're bound to stumble across a few gems. I did. Here's my story breakdown:Vampires in the Lemon Grove - 4/5 - A sweet, touching story about a vampire couple who finally (and happily) discover a way to satiate their thirst for blood through lemons. Definitely a stand out in the creativity category.Reeling for the Empire - 3/5 - A little long winded, but creative, unusual and surprising. A team of women, who are treated like slaves, reel silk for their nation and undergo a shocking transformation. Pretty good, but could have used some edits.The Seagull Army Descends on Strong Beach - 2/5 - Eh, long, drawn out and pretty uneventful. I just couldn't get into this one. The plot was weak and I didn't like the characters. It got better at the end, but at that point I didn't care much.Proving Up - 5/5 -  One of my favorites of the collection, only because Russell spins the yarn so well on this one. She takes her time revealing the dark undercurrent of this unassuming plot. A young boy must save his family by \"proving up\" (becoming a man by claiming his right to land) and is sent on a very peculiar errand. The end is eerie and unsettling.The Barn at the End of Our Term - 5/5 - Positively the best story in this collection. Haven't laughed out loud that much since.... I can't remember! This is a story about a barn in some unknown country location where half the U.S. Presidents have been \"reincarnated\" into horses much to their puzzlement. Rumination of heaven, hell, rule of law and escape are all on the agenda of this new coalition. So incredibly creative and funny. The gem of this entire collection. Just brilliant. Dougbert Shackleton's Rules for Antarctic Tailgating - 3/5 - Exactly what the title describes. Pretty funny. But a little too snarky and clever for it's own good. Style put me off half way through.New Veterans - 4/5 -  Reminded me so much of Ray Bradbury's  The Illustrated Man.  A massage therapist attempts to heal a returning solider who literally carries the burden of the war on his back in the form of a tattoo depicting a battle scene where his close friend was lost. As the therapist massages the tattoo, she realizes she can manipulate the memories of her patient... but for better or worse? Great story.The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis - 4/5 - Dark tale about bullying and the toll it takes years later on the bullies themselves. A group of bullies find a scarecrow replica of a boy they use to terrorize in grade school who later disappeared without a trace. Every night part of the scarecrow disappears much to the dismay of the boys. Psychologically disturbing. Great story about guilt and repentance. All-in-all... not half-bad (which in a short story collection is usually the case - half being bad, that is). My first Karen Russell. Very pleased with my selection. I recommend getting it from the library and read the 4/5 and 5/5 stories."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken", "userReview": "Breadth. This 8-pack of short stories has it in spades. We have send-ups of vampire stories, Gothic Old West stories, contemporary stories, horror stories, humorous stories -- everything but haiku, practically. And, if your thing is \"writers' writers,\" you've come to the right lemon grove. Karen Russell's best friends are words. She plays around with language, with sentences, with unexpected words, and she exults in it. Sometimes you just pause and say, \"Nice.\"But what about the stories, plot-wise, you ask? Well, it's like this. Some are more satisfying than others. They're meaty stories, for one. Most of them are 30 pages or so. Sometimes you feel they have one aside too many. Sometimes you feel they could use a touch of Maxwell Perkins' scissors. But that's a quibble, over all. Description and character are Russell's forte. And weirdness.\"Vampires in the Lemon Grove\" has some fun with the sitting-duck genre of vampire lit -- an earth well scorched by the TWILIGHT series. This vampire couple is on the wagon. No. More. Blood. Strictly sinking their teeth into lemons. And about this sun problem? Bah. These vampires wear sunglasses. Florida is safe no more. The collection gets stranger still with \"Reeling for the Empire,\" wherein young ladies are converted into the sorority sister equivalent of silk worms in the province of Dystopia, Japan (or maybe it's one island over). Odd isn't the word for it.. \"Proving Up\" is a bit reminiscent of Stewart O'Nan's A PRAYER FOR THE DYING. Old West gothic. But you have to admit, it shows Russell's versatility. Even if she does use a little kid to do it (flag on the play).Two stories that will definitely send the traditionalists running? \"The Barn at the End of the Term,\" featuring reincarnated U.S. Presidents coming back as horses (Just Say \"Neigh\" to Nixon!) and \"Dougbert Shackelton's Rules for Antarctic Tailgating,\" a lightweight piece that looked like it hailed from a college lit. magazine, thanks to its sophomoric humor. These two commit the sin of being too cutesy for their own good and would constitute as runts to this litter.It gets more interesting with the last two, however. \"The New Veterans\" looks at a lonely, older masseuse who gives an Iraq War veteran regular massages on his massively-tattooed back. Let's just say the tattoo -- a war scene from his tour depicting the death of a buddy -- comes to life a bit under her caring hands. And \"The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis,\" while striking me as unrealistic, at least is a page-turner, wherein high school bullies get theirs when they go too far picking on a handicapped kid. Clearly Russell has parked her muse in a twilight zone. Rod Sterling would be proud.Overall, quite a performance. Breadth. Depth. Writing chops. A nice mix, all of it. But reader beware. Some will find the talent wasted because it hews too close to the weird side of life. Me? I like how Russell takes risks. And I'm tired of reading typical MFA fare on American suburbia (all together now: yawn). So if you'd like to challenge yourself and see a pro roll the dice, what's to lose? A couple of lemons come with most any bushel, so anticipate as much and enjoy the grove."}], "description": "From the author of the New York Times best seller Swamplandia!\u2014a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize\u2014a magical new collection of stories that showcases Karen Russell's gifts at their inimitable best.In the collection's marvelous title story, two aging vampires in a sun-drenched Italian lemon grove find their hundred-year marriage tested when one of them develops a fear of flying. In \"The Seagull Army Descends on Strong Beach, 1979,\" a dejected teenager discovers that the universe is communicating with him through talismanic objects left in a seagull's nest. \"Proving Up\" and \"The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis\" - stories of children left to fend for themselves in dire predicaments - find Russell veering into more sinister territory, and ultimately crossing the line into full-scale horror. In \"The New Veterans,\" a massage therapist working with a tattooed war veteran discovers she has the power to heal by manipulating the images on his body. In all, these wondrous new pieces display a young writer of superlative originality and invention coming into the full range and scale of her powers.", "title": "Vampires in the Lemon Grove", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13531832-vampires-in-the-lemon-grove", "average": 3.67, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1362466523l/13531832.jpg", "reviews": 2442, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/26417.Karen_Russell", "name": "Karen Russell"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Magical Realism"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13531832-vampires-in-the-lemon-grove", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17369104-vampires-in-the-lemon-grove", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13531751-vampires-in-the-lemon-grove", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18041971-vampires-in-the-lemon-grove", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16685341-vampires-in-the-lemon-grove", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8584686-swamplandia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47085.St_Lucy_s_Home_for_Girls_Raised_by_Wolves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20454977-sleep-donation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17622328-the-graveless-doll-of-eric-mutis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30531364-the-bog-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
