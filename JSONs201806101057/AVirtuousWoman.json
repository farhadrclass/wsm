But I had liked Charms for the Easy Life by this same author. I think my problem this time was simply my expectations. It's not a bad book, but not what I hoped for after reading the back cover. I expected a good love story. The main characters did love each other, but the book was mostly descriptions of all the unpleasant things that happened in their lives, culminating with him trying to cope with her death. I don't enjoy gritty/sordid reality books. I read for escape, inspiration, education, beauty, entertainment, etc. So this book was a wrong turn for me. At least it was short."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/985147-michelle", "userReview": "Have you ever read a book and felt so distant from it shocked you when you realized you were actually in tears? This novel, such a quick read that a devoted reader will finish it in one sitting, seems so benign and irrelevant, yet works its way into your heart. By the end I found myself shockingly gulping for air. This may be an Oprah pick, but it's a smart book that I'd recommend to anyone who can appreciate a simple story line and a solid tale."}, {"userName": "Drebbles", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1862888-drebbles", "userReview": "Beautifully written, A Virtuous Women, is the quiet love story of Ruby Pitt Woodrow, daughter of a rich farmer, and Jack Stokes, a tenant farmer. At first they seem an unlikely match, Ruby, although 20 years younger than Jack, is already widowed, Jack, unattractive and unsuccessful, has never been married. But both have had tough lives. Ruby is alienated from her parents due to her brief marriage which was a disaster. She is working as a maid when she meets Jack. Jack has never had much, although his dream is to own a piece of land. Together they find, if not what they were looking for, a sense of completeness. The book is written in first person narration with both Jack and Ruby narrating alternate chapters (except the last chapter which is written in the third person). This technique helps make both characters seem real. For me, personally, Jack was the character I most cared about, mostly because we know from the very beginning that Ruby dies and we see that Jack is lost without her. This is one of those simple, quiet kind of books where there is little action or plot, just the story of two people who come to love and care for each other. Yet, it's the kind of story that will stay with you long after you've read it."}, {"userName": "Linda Lipko", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1544522-linda-lipko", "userReview": "After reading Ellen Foster, I thought I simply had to read more by this author. I made a special trip to the library to obtain another.I was disappointed. While I realize it is difficult to follow one superb book with another, this one fell flat, was choppy, was boring and I'm very glad I read Ellen Foster first or I would not have continued to read more.Ruby Trip is privileged by southern, small-town farm standards. She has loving parents who dote on her and who can afford food on the table and a roof over their head.Ruby was pampered to the detrimental extent that when unsupervised she makes very poor choices, including running away to marry a near-do-well migrant worker.Jack Stokes is a tenant farmer, poor in worldly goods, rich in a loving spirit and gentleness toward ruby. Rescuing Ruby from poverty when her abusive husband dies, Jack shows Ruby respect, patience and a life of kind understanding.This is the story of Ruby and Jack as they grow to love each other.A story is one of a loving untraditional relationship, with one chapter told by Ruby and another by Jack."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234251-kara", "userReview": "One of the reviews on this book was from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper. Their review states, \"So true and so vital I would swear there were moments when A VIRTUOUS WOMAN actually vibrated in my hands.\" When I read that review, I just knew that this book would be a 'good read.' I was so disappointed with this book. The only vibrating that I experienced while reading this book was when I experienced convulsions from a boredom seizure. I didn't like the characters-- except for Mavis, and she was nixed from the story so quickly. I guess I was just expecting this great love story, and I got a story written in hillbilly colloquial context. At some points, it was just confusing because I don't speak hillbilly as a 2nd language. It was just WEIRD to read. Then, one of the uneducated characters, like Jack, would use a word like 'accumulate.' I just didn't see how that could be a realistic word within the scope of Jack's vocabulary. Anyway, I'm done ranting. I would not suggest for anybody to waste their time reading this book. Please... for the sake of all mankind.... do not read this book."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663300-tara", "userReview": "I loved this simple, oft-told story of two down-and-out people who find each under and get pleasure in the duty of caring for one another. The story and setting are not unique, but the voice of both characters, and the collage the story is laid out in, and the insights resonate with me still. OK, and I cried at the end. Not many books can make me do that anymore."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth C.

I can't seem to talk about the novel without including details from the plot.I read Ellen Foster first. I thought it was well-written, and I *almost* always enjoy Southern authors.So, off I went to find A Virtuous Woman. A few things:1) Ruby fits Proverbs 31's description of a virtuous woman AFTER she marries Jack. I loved this connection.2) I appreciate the \"realness\", the \"grittiness\" of these characters and their circumstances.3) I am happy to see a novel (or novella) in the Southern Gothic style.If you want a sweet romance that ends on a happy note - THIS IS NOT the book for you.These characters are fleshed out and flawed, but they love each other. They share a life together. And, when Ruby dies, she does all that she can to ensure Jack is taken care of for as long as possible. His love for her threatens to send him into a downward spiral he cannot recover from, but then, he is saved by a gift.I enjoy the style of writing in this book. I enjoyed the change in the points of view. I enjoyed the characters and their development. I also enjoy the dialogue, the setting, the sensory details.Again, it is a gritty, earthy story that is about two people who love each other and share a life together. I would NOT classify it as romance. I would classify it as a southern gothic story."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12466067-suzanne", "userReview": "Gosh, for such a small book, it took me forever to read it. While I enjoyed Gibbon's writing style, she really does a good job making her characters lifelike, it just never took off for me. It was very slow paced. Nothing exciting happened that made me anxious to pick it back up after I put it down. Lesser characters Tiny Fran and Roland were painted as stereo-typical small-minded and selfish archetypes, creating the brunt of the conflicts in the story. The main characters, Jack and Ruby initially came off as a cute mismatched pair, (She the young beauty. He the skinny older man) and I enjoyed reading about them, but if the author was inferring that Ruby was a virtuous woman, I'm not sure I'd agree. Virtuous means righteous, good, pure, upstanding. Half way through the story, Ruby and Jack, along with their neighbor, Burr, seem to take too much enjoyment out of tormenting the antagonists. Jack and Ruby's ridicule and often harsh reactions to the antagonists' infractions made them nearly as unlikeable as the people they condemned. It's not often I come out of a book not sure of the point of the story."}, {"userName": "June", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1026897-june", "userReview": "This was a very spare novel about a husband and wife, Ruby and Jack. The author alternates the POV between the two. I found the vernacular a little confusing at first, and the switching between narrators had me flipping back and forth to see who was speaking. The last two or three chapters were told by other narrators, and that was interesting. The book gives a very intimate look into their lives. You find out early on that Ruby is dying of lung cancer. It reminded me of some of Annie Proulx's books. The prose is very spartan. These characters say what they need to in few words. It's intimate, but not overly introspective, which is nice."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600090-kathryn", "userReview": "I started this book twice. The first time I thought it odd, rather strange yet in the back of my head I knew I have loved all of Kaye Gibbons books, so decided to start again. This book ripped at my heartstrings. It is so honest, told one chapter from the husband and one from the wife. It was short, an easy read. I don't often run across the word virtuous - it's definition is: having or showing high moral standards. Ruby was truly that."}, {"userName": "Louize", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3019973-louize", "userReview": "My interest in this story was initially poked during one of my husband\u2019s daily devotion. That day\u2019s lesson was entitled Greatness written by Brian K. Bauknight and the Bible reference was from Proverbs 31:10-31. That day was my birthday.A virtuous woman, Ruby was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. Instead of worrying on her dying state, she busied herself preparing food for her husband for the months ahead\u2026 when she\u2019s already gone. She was more worried about how Jack will get by without her. Being orphaned at an early age, it was difficult for Jack to let go of Ruby. She was the only tangible evidence of life for him\u2026 the only one who truly cared. He was a farmer without a land, a man without a child, and a husband without a wife.On the surface, this was a marriage of circumstance and convenience between two brutally honest people, Ruby and Jack. Beneath, theirs was an unconventional love story with unquestionable depth. A relationship that only two people who truly cares for each other may understand. Each was cherished quietly but unconditionally.This story was alternately narrated between the two main characters, which gave it more emotion and made it very personal."}, {"userName": "Mari", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9300479-mari", "userReview": "I read this book in 1997 and wrote a letter to the Oprah Book Club hoping to be invited to be on the show to have dinner with the author.

It was my son who said I should probably come home because the Oprah Show had just called and was going to call back. I jumped out of the water and went running home in time to get the second call.The producer asked me questions about the book, about myself, and about my reading tastes. She said they really liked my letter and that I was sure to be on the show UNLESS Oprah decided to only invite people who had been adopted as was the main character in the book.

It starts out. \"She hasn't been dead four months and I've already eaten to the bottom of the deep freeze. I even ate the green peas. Used to I wouldn't turn my hand over for green peas.\"The book flows well, and the great love expressed by Jack for Ruby is quite beautiful.

They meet at the end of Ruby's brief and disastrous marriage to a brutal drifter and don't fall in love so much as fall together. Yet their relationship endures and deepens into a quiet and profound love. Gibbons captures the rhythms and styles of her character's speech so perfectly that you can literally hear the timbres of their voices and see their facial expressions as you read.This novel has some structural similarities with The Time Traveler's Wife, but has a lot more in common with the first ten minutes of Up.

The story begins by telling us that Jack has recently lost his wife, so his narration is in the present, while Ruby's are right before she passed away.

I didn't think that you could feel so connected to so many characters in such a short amount of time.

I loved the characters Jack and Ruby - two disparate human beings who found each other in a world where that doesn't always happen. It's not the typical \"people from different backgrounds\" story. It's so much more than that - finding what makes life work through the connection to another human.
