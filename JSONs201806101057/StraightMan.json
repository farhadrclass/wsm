It\u2019s really an academic novel, centered on a 49-year old professor (mid-life crisis?) at a lower-tier university, perhaps a branch campus, in a by-passed town in Pennsylvania. He is in the \u201csandwich generation\u201d with a wife, whom he loves, who is a school principal, and two daughters. One married daughter lives in town and they worry about her financial situation and that she might be in an abusive relationship. His mother also lives in town and the word is that his father, separated from her, may be moving back in. The main character\u2019s father, haunts the book like a ghost and he does not appear in person until the end of the novel. His father was a \u201ccelebrity academic,\u201d well-published, constantly on the move with visiting professorships and always with an attractive female grad student in tow.First about the town, Railton, \u201c\u2026divided by the tracks into two unattractive halves.\u201d Church Street has none of its six churches left. Yet the faculty stay because \u201cWe quickly learned how much more it cost to live in places where people actually wanted to live.\u201d The main character happens to be the English department chair for a year, not because he is especially well-liked or a talented administrator, but simply because it\u2019s his turn in the barrel and the faculty see him as the lowest common denominator they can agree on. He is both anti-union and anti-administration, earning him enemies on both sides. He treasures his wise-ass reputation (thus the book\u2019s title), surviving on cynicism and disparagement of almost everything and everyone. Anyone who has been in academia will appreciate the accuracy of what Russo lambastes. They are a faculty of inertia and lost opportunity; some didn\u2019t finish their doctorates or their books; a few could have gone elsewhere years ago but didn\u2019t; now they are trapped in this mini-world of mutual bickering and disgust. Here\u2019s a taste:Russo calls it an \u201c\u2026atmosphere of distrust, suspicion and retribution.\u201d We all know the quote attributed to Henry Kissinger (although many said it before him) about academic politics being so vicious because the stakes are so trivial. I also think of Stoner in John William\u2019s novel where his chairman held a grudge against him for twenty years over a trivial matter. On the endless faculty meetings, he can\u2019t remember the last time anyone changed his or her mind as a result of all the reasoned discourse; in fact it seems as if the discussions further entrench everyone in their original position. All hiring procedures are dominated by political correctness. One young male professor with a ponytail corrects everyone\u2019s generic \u201che\u201d so frequently that they call him \u201cOrshee\u201d behind his back.The main character loves it when someone says \u201cWe\u2019re all reasonable people.\u201d He\u2019ll respond: \u201cName ONE!\u201dThe main character published one novel 20 years ago which his former chairman always referred to as his \u201ccollected works.\u201dThe faculty union rep says to him: I know \u201c\u2026you think we [the union] defend incompetence, promote mediocrity.\u201d To which he responds \u201cI wish you WOULD promote mediocrity\u2026[it\u2019s] a reasonable goal for our institution.\u201dOn the latest rumor that financial exigency is going to result in the administration cutting tenured faculty: \u201c[Not] unless the faculty are going to be invited to drink Jim Jones Kool-Aid after the donkey basketball game and then buried in a mass grave.\u201dA lot of his vitriol is directed at his ever-absent, pompous father:The problem with the title \u201cDistinguished Visiting Professor:\u201d \u201c\u2026it\u2019s hard to remain distinguished among people who know you.\u201dHis father got two attractive offers that led him to take a job at Columbia U; one from the university for a full professorship, and one from a young woman graduate student.On his father\u2019s best-selling book of literary criticism: \u201ceveryone buys it, displays it, discusses it, without finding the time to actually read it.\u201dA grad student corrects papers in his father\u2019s large class but he grades papers from his tiny seminar himself. \u201cThat is, he placed a letter grade on them and for all anyone knew may even have read them.\u201d Other passages I liked: \u201c\u2026two people who love each other need not necessarily have the same dreams and aspirations, but they damn well ought to share the same nightmares.\u201d His younger daughter, \u201cthe least thoughtful but the most outspoken of his three feminists\u201d (wife and two daughters) says \u201cMenstruation always was the real red badge of courage.\u201d  \u201cRachael [his department secretary] is one of the half-dozen women on campus with whom I have to work at not falling in love.\u201d\u201cHis mind was simply voided, as if the thoughts in his head were composed of iron filings and he was standing too close to a magnet.\u201dAll in all, great humor, a very good read, and a spot-on snapshot of the academy. Russo was a faculty member at Southern Illinois and at Colby College, Maine. I\u2019m giving it a 4, not a 5, because the humor, unlike in Empire Falls, degenerates into farce, almost slapstick at times. Still highly recommended.

I thought Empire Falls was pretty brilliant but in my mind, you should have won a Pulitzer for Straight Man. I would have voted for Straight Man but damn, I'm not on the panel, but if I was, I'd vote for Straight Man.You know, I had to wait ages to read it; my library didn't have it. So I ordered it from that place with the same name as where the guy who may or may not have shot Kennedy was standing when he made the shot. You know, The Book Depository although this one is in the UK and I'm in Australia so it took a little time to deliver. But nothing with Free Postage is really top shelf, is it? and the print in this copy was microscopic. So I then had to buy the new hardback from your US of A which cost more, the postage was huge, and took another little time to deliver. But heck, was the wait worth it! It was brilliant, witty, extraordinarily funny,and unforgettable; the best two days I ever spent in a book. A quiet word between you and me: If you did base Hank Deveraux Jr on someone you know, please send him my way. I could use a little of his talented, comedic and offbeat outlook lately. And I'd certainly value having someone around whose life is filled with such hilarious moments as is his.The people sharing the train carriage on the four hour trip to Melbourne with me did not appreciate the ripples of laughter, the knee slapping or the chuckles that burst from me while I was reading Straight Man. In fact, I nearly took Straight Man into the bathroom with me, for fear someone would eject the innocent but exhilaratingly humorous novel from the train in my absence.Actually, if I was on the panel, I'd say \u201cgive him the Pulitzer for both novels\u201d. signedB the Book AddictFrom the dust jacket:\u201cPacked with scenes of pure genius, and memorable characters \u2013 from the egregious administrator Pope to the manic dog Occam \u2013 Straight man is another triumph of humour and humanity by the author of Nobody's Fool.

His books are always embedded in forlorn towns, circling around Dilapidated Central, suffering blue-collar havens, podunk as can be, with sell-by-dates splashed all over it. The people, towns, souls and minds have lost their initial charm while slowly sliding into obscurity. The atmosphere is always a bit depressing. The stories are always slow-moving, and satirical social commentary becomes the mainstay of all the conversations everywhere. FROM THE BLURB\nRichard Russo performs his characteristic high-wire walk between hilarity and heartbreak. Russo's protagonist is William Henry Devereaux, Jr., the reluctant chairman of the English department of a badly underfunded college in the Pennsylvania rust belt. Devereaux's reluctance is partly rooted in his character--he is a born anarchist-- and partly in the fact that his department is more savagely divided than the Balkans.In the course of a single week, Devereaux will have his nose mangled by an angry colleague, imagine his wife is having an affair with his dean, wonder if a curvaceous adjunct is trying to seduce him with peach pits, and threaten to execute a goose on local television. All this while coming to terms with his philandering father, the dereliction of his youthful promise, and the ominous failure of certain vital body functions. In short, Straight Man is classic Russo--side-splitting and true-to-life, witty, compassionate, and impossible to put down.\nI have never closed a book of this author feeling anything but good. There will be humor and sadness, and the story will be a terrific ode to mediocrity. He knows how to apply malapropisms to the lives of his characters in his realistic fiction.In the city of Railton, Pennsylvania, forty-nine year old William Henry Devereaux, Jr. is a rogue;An ingrate according to Teddy Barnes;Dickie Pope thinks he's insane, unprincipled and  too idealistic;\"Judas Peckerwood\", says Billy Quigley;\"Beatnick\" says Lou;\"A Clever man\" says his mother;\"Absentminded\", say the three feminists in his life: his wife Lily and his two daughters.\"A vague pain in the collective ass\" - concludes the laissez-fair William Henry Devereaux, Jr. himself. Not that it deters the solipsistic professor to feel like his dog, Occam: the fastest, the smartest, the bravest, especially in his dreams, where he is always this hell of a guy, always optimistic about the future. World-weary and always upstream, he cannot be moved into action, except when he encounters a urinary track problem. Some sort of bladder hysteria, according to his doctor. He has all his bickering, gossiping colleagues in the English department miffed with his sardonic wit, where they scramble for positions, drive their own agendas, backbite for recognition; fight their petty battles, slave away to their own superior ambitions, with little talent to back it up. They have been working together for twenty years and basically overstayed their welcome in each other's lives.This is a gentle character-based comedy about life in academe. Hilarious moments with sadness subtly interwoven in the characters' backstories. But there is also \u201cAnimal rights thugs guarding the pond, sexual harassment lunches, the detoxing of Modern Languages. Something\u2019s happening here. What it is ain\u2019t exactly clear.\u201dRichard Russo is read with an open mind. The protagonist, Henry Devereaux, reminds me so much of Sully in his other books. And I love that kind curmudgeon! Expect the unexpected. And make time. It's so absolutely worth it."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "I remember almost nothing about Richard Russo's Straight Man. I imagine I laughed a couple of times, and I think I enjoyed the reading experience, but there is only one specific thing that I remember from the book itself. More on that later, though, because I want to talk about the peripheral things I remember about Straight Man.I remember reading it for a Literary Theory class (my first class at my new University) with one of my all time favourite profs, Dr. W---. He admitted, very early into the book, that he hadn't read it before. His wife is a librarian, you see, and he always let her pick a wild card book for whichever class he happened to be teaching, something she was sure he'd like, something she thought would be appropriate. She picked Straight Man because Dr. W--- was the chair of an English Dept. in a seriously underfunded university where he played chief negotiator and neutral observer to a pack of bickering tenured maniacs. He apologized for the choice, realizing that it wasn't the best book to apply literary theory too, but he kept using it and did a damn fine job.Meanwhile, in the back of the classroom, I made friends with a wonderful woman named MM (you didn't think I was going to give her complete name did you? What's the fun in that?). She was in her early fifties, a southern belle of the old school, and I discovered that she was also the secretary of the English Dept. She audited a class every semester, just for fun, and Dr. W---'s class was her freebie. Why is this important? Well, MM took a liking to me, recommended me to Dr. W---, and I found myself as the Grad Assistant for the next two years, and that's where I met a woman, the Undergrad Assistant, who I loved deeply and passionately.Furthermore, every time I've taken a pee in a public restroom (since I read the book over a decade ago) I have had a mindflash of the main character, HD, comparing the power of his stream to the young bucks that pee next to him. I can't take a public pee without thinking of the book, nor can I take a public pee without comparing my stream with whomever's around. And sadly, my stream doesn't have the power it used to. Now I worry about kidney stones and prostate exams and future erectile dysfunction, and all because this damned book has made the power of my stream a permanent obsession (and in case you're wondering, this is the ONE specific thing I remember from Straight Man). What the hell is up with that?!As for what I think about Straight Man...well...who cares? I doubt Russo would care what I think, even if he knew me. What matters, at least what I think should matter, is that just the sight of Straight Man's cover, that cheesy red thing with the drake (or is it a gander?) brings back memories of Dr. W---, MM and that girl. And every pee I take calls to mind that cheesy red cover with the gander (or is it a drake?). That's gotta be good enough for any author.Shit...it would be for me."}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "3.5 stars.This had parts I found interesting, some very funny scenes, some compassionate, and some where I tuned out. Russo's humor is wry and masculine. Often jokes are made at the expense of others (students, females, academic colleagues, and academia alike are targeted), but also self-deprecating. I adore him, but will probably always compare all his works to Empire Falls, a tough one to live up to.

The types of characters he creates, the settings in which he places his characters, how he builds his characters and the type of conflict he creates in his stories. While some level of predictability comes with this familiarity, I continue to enjoy Russo\u2019s work. For one thing, he makes me laugh. I also enjoy his characters and find myself rooting for them despite their insistence on repeating past mistakes with predictable results. Not that any of us have ever done that! Straight Man is excellent Russo fare. I enjoyed my time with Hank, and just like Hank I often wasn\u2019t sure why he was doing what he was doing. He seemed to have no clear plan. He seemed to be finding his way as he made his choices. As a reader I felt like I was figuring it out as Hank was figuring it out. Compared to some of Russo\u2019s other efforts, though, I felt that I didn\u2019t get to know the secondary characters as well as I would have liked. Overall, a very enjoyable read highly recommended to anyone who likes Russo."}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne", "userReview": "\"What ails people is never simple, and William of Occam, who provided mankind with a beacon of rationality by which to view the world of physical circumstance, knew better than to apply his razor to the irrational, where entities multiply like strands of a virus under a microscope\"Straight Man is the fourth novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, Richard Russo. William Henry Devereaux Jnr, (Hank) at almost fifty, is interim chairman of the English department at the (chronically underfunded) West Central Pennsylvania University in Railton. A certain week in April sees him enduring quite a variety of trials, both mental and physical. It all starts in a meeting where he is nasally mangled by a colleague. Or does it? Perhaps his absent father has had more influence that he admits. Russo subjects his protagonist to bouts of overactive imagination, the suspicions and petty politics of colleagues, his students' decided lack of promise, his daughter's marital problems, a tempting flirtation with a younger woman, and an irritating (and possibly worrying) deterioration in the function of a certain organ. Ducks, geese, a TV news crew, the local jail, a hot tub, peaches and their pits, a dog called Occam and a missing ceiling tile complete the picture. Hank holds his colleagues in disdain (\"You know the kind of company I keep. If it weren't for erroneous conclusions, these people would never arrive at any at all\"), is critical of his friends (\"He misses all the details than even an out-of-practice storyteller like me would not only mention but place in the foreground. He's like a tone-deaf man trying to sing, sliding between notes, tapping his foot arhythmically, hoping his exuberance will make up for not bothering to establish a key\"), and loves the wife who knows him entirely too well (\"Promise me you'll act surprised\" is one of Lily's favourite, supposedly harmless pretences..........\"It hurts my feelings to pretend to be this dumb,\" I tell my wife. \"Don't you care what people think of me?\" But she just smiles. \"They won't notice,\" she always explains. \"It'll blend in with all the times you're genuinely slow.\")He knows his own weaknesses (\"I try to tell myself it's nothing but decent affection I feel for her, but the truth is, it doesn't feel entirely decent. She's too lovely a woman for this to be decent affection, though it's probably not exactly indecent either. Is there a state more or less halfway between decency and indecency? Is there a name for such a realm? The Kingdom of Cowardice? The Fiefdom of Altruism? The Grove of Academe?\") and is well aware of his flaws (\"I use my own solitude to consider what may well be my worst character flaw, the fact that in the face of life's seriousness, its pettiness, its tragedy, its lack of coherent meaning, my spirits are far too easily restored\")This is a book filled with humour, some of it quite dark, and much of it very dry; it will have readers grinning, chuckling and laughing out loud, so is perhaps not a book to read in public. Russo gives Hank some succinct and insightful observations: \"What I suspect is that this brandy is intended to brace me for unpleasantness, and that any brandy used for this purpose may be imbued with medicinal bitterness if you suspect the truth\". He also allows Hank to display his literary talent in the form of descriptive prose: \"Properly medicated, Yolanda felt becalmed on a flat lake where others nearby were sailing about merrily, wind snapping in their sails......Skipping her medication caused the sails of her own small craft to billow like the others, allowed her to join in the merriment, tacking in and out among the other revelers, the wind in her hair and her clothing\".Fans of Russo's earlier books will not be disappointed with Straight Man; readers new to his work will want to seek out more works by this talented author. Clever and brilliantly funny."}, {"userName": "Stephen P", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11602286-stephen-p", "userReview": "He lives his life as head of the English Department at a western Pennsylvania University.. Married, he is the father of grown children, the owner of a house and dog. The fifty years of his life has been dedicated to the fine honing of obstinate vengeance, the satisfaction of tripping others up, the culmination not of progressing himself or family but the endless monotone of self-destruction. These are the consequences with which he sculpts himself, along with a sealed isolation protecting him from those others floating about him.We must discuss the writing style of this book. It is both necessary and important. There is no style. This a not a studied Oullipian attempt at writing under imposed limitations, or an effort to be subversive or clever. Russo writes with earnest simplicity of a story told. Without the flowering of grand phrases or the twinings of stylistic experimentation, he allows the story to unfold smooth, at its own pace. (A difficult and courageous act for a writer to have the faith in a story that it will be sufficient without extraneous help.)It reads interesting and easy. I did not read studiously slow treating the book as a text, while looking over my shoulder and whispering in my ear, Hey S. that was a solid interpretation. Good going son your are piecing together a theme. I simply listened to a story teller telling me a story.Afterward I realized there were numerous gems not hidden but that I missed since I was rightfully engaged at reading on hearing-a-story-level.He is not coy. These notations of deep concern and importance are events that surface out of the process of original and true story telling. At times, labeled as a lunch-pail working man's writer has been misleading and may stir readers adrift The confusion lies with subjugating earnestness, the straightforwardness of narrative which does not explore the poetics of flare and archeological placements of metaphor with a particular class. This unfairly limits its mission as well as both sides of the discussion. It is thus and more. I missed many gems but I would not read it for the first time differently. The solution comes in rereading it. An example of one stumbled upon-I will not give details and try not to ruin things for potential readers-is when we share a tragedy with another often we make a silent pact that as a unit of two we will forget it. What it entails in the fine print never read is that each will walk through numerous lifelong strategies to create a safe distance from one another. Even someone close may need to be sacrificed from any form of intimacy to keep pain shuttled at bay.All through this book is quietly rendered how our lives are shaped by the silent pacts we make with others and with ourselves. Pacts we never knew we signed much less were notarized and perused endlessly by a team of hidden lawyers. It is a cautionary tale yet Russo undercuts it all with a biting humor. Most amazing, and this is what elevates this story and he as a writer, it is told by and about the narrator, again a person whose life is crafted by an obsession for vengeance without knowing why or who the vengeance is truly aimed at. In another writers hands this could result in an arid flatness. Yet, Russo makes him, the story, endlessly fascinating while quietly embedding it in the folds of the reader's mind. This takes writerly skill beyond most. He deserves a greater abundance of recognition and a label on the cover of this book warning readers to not be fooled by the earnestness of its simplicity. Treasures can easily be walked past and never found."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/314540-emily", "userReview": "Hilarious!!!!

Hank had a constant barrage of supposedly clever lines that fell flat and just made him out to be a jerk and meanwhile the whole story was written in a way that felt like a constant attack - like I was supposed to get the real issues at stake when honestly, I couldn't - and the gruff exterior but nice inside guy can be endearing except this guy totally wasnt. While this book had at least more humor than Bridge it still paled tremendously against Empire Falls and aside from the one scene that inspired this recommendation (students in an English class saying things like, 'dude, it's like a metaphor')I was just annoyed at any and all the characters at any given point.

The first is that I myself am an academic of sorts and I already know how ridiculous I am. Second: the genre has always seemed to me like shooting fish (with PhDs) in a barrel.But now, I'm going on the academic job market this year, so I've decided some comic relief about my chosen profession might be a good thing. The main reason being: if I can tell myself on some level that it's all a giant cluster-cuss of ego-surfing solipsistic lunacy than I won't feel as bad when no one hires me. I decided to start with Russo because, quite simply, I like the cut of the man's writing jib. It's probably not cool to like Richard Russo anymore (if it ever was). He's a bit too good humored and dare I say, optimistic, for the average literary reader. And many of his books get made into movies that your parents like. But still, I turn to Russo for humanism. Not specifically for the fundamental good in people, but for the ways in which he seems to understand the small humiliations, irrational desires, and fleeting joys that make up much of our lives and the way he forgives us for our inability to make sense of all this. He finds something noble and big-hearted in even the most dispiriting aspects of contemporary American culture. Like, say, for instance, the way a college is run. The familiar tropes show up here from page one. Lots of tweed. Department in-fighting. Feminists vs Old Department Dinosaurs. Heavy drinking. Philandering. Student protests. And of course, Delusions of Grandeur. However, navigating it all is a Henry Devereaux, Jr, a reluctant department chair, ex-writer, and career ironist. Aside from all of the very funny set pieces, and academic gags, the pleasure in this book is in watching the evolution of a character whose mask and essence couldn't be more different. He deflects the silly, sorry state of his life and career with puns, sarcastic quips, and cutting bon mots. He rarely says anything he means. Yet, as the novel progresses, he's forced to make decisions that bring him ever closer to figuring out what he really believes, something he hasn't really thought about in twenty years. My only substantive complaint about the book is that Russo has a kitchen sink approach to comedy. Aside from Henry's problems with department cuts, he also has an estranged father moving back, a delusional mother, a crazy father-in-law, a secretary he might be in love with, a possible gall stone problem, a daughter on the outs with her husband, a vendetta against an aggressive goose, a possibly unhinged writing student, and other handfuls of daily tribulations. All of this keeps the yuks coming, but at times seems more like piling-on than plotting. In the end, however, I think The Straight Man had the effect I was looking for. I got to laugh at myself and the club that would have me for a member (at least for now). And I got a worthy protagonist in the bargain.

A friend recommended this book to me, telling me it was a story of academic dysfunction, a state we are both familiar with. However, it\u2019s more a story of a very frustrating, asshole of a man who I wanted to smack fairly early on. William Henry Devereaux, Jr. is a tenured English professor in a small, mediocre liberal arts university. He is also the temporary chair of the English department. The university is beset by rumors of budget cuts, and as chair, his colleagues assume he knows the truth behind the rumors and what positions will be cut. Hank (as he is known) protests he knows nothing. His wife, Lily, is a teacher at the local high school. Their younger daughter, Julie, is married to Russell. They are overspending their budget by building a house near them. His father, William Henry Devereaux, Sr., PhD, is a legend in the academic world for his books on literary analysis. He also abandoned his wife and child many years ago. He is now moving back to town to live with his long-divorced first wife, Hank\u2019s mother. While trying to teach his classes and negotiate his personal life, Hank must also try to keep the hysteria and dysfunction of his department under control before the dean and the CEO (I\u2019m guessing this is another name for the president of the university) decides to can the lot of them. Aside from the occasional sentence that made me laugh or I could nod in agreement with, I didn\u2019t like this book. The two best-written and compelling sections of the book are ironically stories within the story written by Hank for the local paper. The first is a story about his first dog and the second is about his father. They are both touching, funny, and compelling. I enjoyed them. Unlike the rest of the book, which I rarely found touching, funny or compelling. I don\u2019t know what the point of the damn book is. Hank has to be one the most annoying, frustrating, assholish characters I have ever had the displeasure to spend time with. He is absolutely useless. He seems to me to be useless as a husband, because he is oblivious to everything and doesn\u2019t seem to pay attention to anything going on his personal life and a downright pain in the ass as a colleague and chair of the English department. He responds to his colleagues\u2019 concerns about the budget crisis (and their possible loss of jobs) by ignoring them, joking about it, and, when it is time for him to take some kind of action, he does absolutely nothing\u2014like the useless coward he is. He doesn\u2019t take a stand on anything. That is so frustrating to me! He doesn\u2019t fight anything, he doesn\u2019t state his convictions, he just treats everything and everyone like a huge joke. I understand his reluctance to create a list of colleagues who should be cut. I would be reluctant too. However, he\u2019s at least in a position to wield some influence over the decisions and cut the faculty who are terrible (and he has opinions about that) and try to save the jobs of others who are decent. He doesn\u2019t even try. He never tries to accomplish anything, not one thing, throughout the entire novel. He never even thinks creatively about the situation\u2014how to ease the pain for some of these people, how to maybe get them a decent severance package, nothing. Hank is a despicable person. He spends his days avoiding the union officer, the dean, his coworkers, his mother and any other problem that inconveniences him. No wonder the damn man couldn\u2019t pee (and his urinary difficulties were mentioned a great deal, often in the context of a childish joke. Just shut up about it already). To make matters worse, he\u2019s rewarded for his bullshit cowardice. In the epilogue, everything is tied up so neatly it made me gag. His wife gets a better job, he gets a better teaching schedule, a grant they proposed years ago is rediscovered and awarded, his daughter and son-in-law get back together and unload their expensive house and get jobs in Atlanta, and the English department\u2014so full of people of who hated each other\u2014now all get along! And have barbeques together and play basketball! Yippee! Are you fucking kidding me? Hate. What was the point of all of Hank\u2019s philosophical moaning and bullshit \u201cjokes\u201d when it all comes out so hunky-dory in the end? Other than a few digs about academia (\u201cHe\u2019s been a reasonably well-intentioned, lazy, honorable, mildly incompetent dean, and that\u2019s the best you can hope for.\u201d 246 and \u201cAnyone who observed us would conclude the purpose of all academic discussion was to provide the grounds for becoming further entrenched in our original positions.\u201d 201\u2014that one is so true it\u2019s just barely funny), I didn\u2019t enjoy this book. Most of what I disliked about this book (other than it seems to have had no point at all), revolves around the character of Hank. I disliked how he would often refer to himself in the third person, using his full name: \u201cWilliam Henry Devereaux, Jr.\u201d I disliked his near constant phrase: \u201cI\u2019m not X, but I can play that role.\u201d I think he is all those things he said he wasn\u2019t. The constant referral to William of Occam, the philosopher, and his \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d philosophy made me gnash my teeth. Stop! Rachel, Hank\u2019s secretary, is unable to speak declarative sentences so everything she says sounds like a question. Do you know how fucking irritating it is to read dialogue by a character that always ends in question marks? It\u2019s really irritating and unfortunately Rachel had too much to say. She\u2019s also another one of the characters who had marvelous things happen for her at the end of the book. There\u2019s a definite lack of decent female characters in this book. There are very few women characters in this novel who aren\u2019t slutty, drunk, bitchy or generally useless. One of them is Hank\u2019s saint of a wife, but she\u2019s barely a character and is absent for 99% of the novel. I regret purchasing this book. I disliked it very much and Hank is a useless asshole who needs to grow the fuck up. This book is more about Hank the 50-yr-old juvenile than a commentary on academic life (which is why I bought it). Dear Committee Members is a much sharper and better written commentary on the frustrating reality of modern academia than Straight Man. I don\u2019t recommend this book unless you enjoy reading about useless cowardly men who make lame jokes out of everything while they experience a mid-life crisis."}, {"userName": "Jason Pettus", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus", "userReview": "[Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography (cclapcenter.com). I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.]I was all excited when I first stumbled across this in the \"New Additions\" section of the Chicago Public Library's ebook collection, because I thought I had randomly come across Pulitzer winner Richard Russo's newest title just minutes after it had been announced at the website, and therefore was going to get to check it out before anybody else; but in fact, although it was new to their collection, the book itself is from 1997, and in fact is one of the more well-loved ones of his entire career. A gentle character-based comedy about life among academes in a small college town, like Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys and Jane Smiley's Moo it takes the self-reflective topic of writing professors on a closed campus (usually a no-no in writing guides for beginners) and embraces it for all it's worth, really delving into the quirky little details that come specifically with academic life, but spicing it up with enough interesting plot developments to make it much more than the usual piece of circle-jerking masturbation than the \"writing professor writing about writing professors\" subgenre usually produces. And of course, in this case things are helped immensely as well by the main character being such a fascinatingly complex and charming curmudgeon, an aging fiction professor who has long ago accepted his fate at the third-tier podunk college where they all gossip and backbite, and who in his very mild way has decided to rage against the machine which is campus pettiness, combining a world-weary attitude with occasional bursts of M*A*S*H-style outrageous actions, including his habit of playing the Motley Fool whenever in front of the local media just to stir up more crap for his overlords on the school's board of directors. I usually have a low tolerance for this kind of metafictional material, but again like Wonder Boys and Moo this is a rare exception, expressly because Russo takes the time and energy to put together a wonderfully entertaining, sometimes legitimately thrilling story to take place in this environment, instead of the usual endless whiny screeds about middle-aged men having affairs with their 19-year-old students. It comes hugely recommended, and makes me even more excited than I was to finally tackle his Pulitzer-winning Empire Falls for the CCLaP 100 later this year."}, {"userName": "Robert W", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/386590-robert-w", "userReview": "The Richard Russo books I\u2019ve read have all taken place in decaying New York mill towns. Straight Man varies that by taking place in a decaying Pennsylvania railroad town. Actually, it differs from his other books quite significantly by belonging to another genre\u2014it\u2019s a campus comedy, a genre I associate with writers like David Lodge. Russo does a hell of a good job with it, as would be expected. William Henry Devereaux is the creative writing professor at a small state college, a place where his colleagues are mostly mediocre, as are his students. Devereaux is the temporary chair of the English Department (while they search for a permanent head), and the university administration is hinting at layoffs. He is therefore placed between the administrators and the faculty, loved by neither side, assumed by each side of favoring the other. Considering his basic lack of leadership ability (not to mention temperament), it\u2019s a position that is very uncomfortable for him. His body reacts\u2014he can\u2019t seem to piss, he had near-blackouts, and his nose has been ripped-open Chinatown-like by an angry colleague (a bizarre accident\u2014she only meant to hit him in the face with a spiral-bound notebook).All of Russo\u2019s books start slow and build. Straight Man, being a comedy, builds more quickly and reaches a somewhat manic pace. This kind of book depends on a piling on of events, and tends to end abruptly. Russo doesn\u2019t depart from that time-honored approach, and consequently by the end, I was reading faster and faster, unable to set it aside.

One who sets the scene for a great punchline. I can easily tell you a way to determine if you will enjoy Straight Man. Read the prologue. If you find yourself smiling or even laughing out loud, please continue. If you find no humor, close the book and move on. The prologue is far from the funniest scene in the book but it does portray the brand of humor that is laced throughout.If you went to a liberal arts college you may find added humor as that is the setting.

Just two years ago Jane Smiley, who teaches at Iowa State, lambasted a Midwestern university in \"Moo: A Novel,\" (Random House) a bestseller that sprawled across dozens of strange and hilarious characters.The narrator of the latest addition to this genre, \"Straight Man\" by Richard Russo, observes wryly that \"virtually everybody in the English department has a half-written novel squirreled away in a desk drawer. Sad little vessels all. Scruffy the Tugboat, lost and scared on the open sea. All elegantly written, all with the same artistic goal - to evidence a superior sensibility.\"Fortunately, Russo's fully written novel is neither sad nor overwrought for he evinces plenty of elegance and flawless timing. He demonstrates that it's possible to laugh at, and with, someone simultaneously.The novel opens at the peak of a budget crisis at West Central Pennsylvania University that threatens to fall with particular severity on the English department. Forced into the center of this debate is the reluctant interim chair, William Henry Devereaux Jr., who proudly admits that his \"lack of administrative skill is legend.\"In a moment of ill-conceived fury he preempts the televised dedication of a new Technical Careers Center by threatening to kill one of the campus geese every day until a budget arrives on his desk.With outrageous but straight-faced retorts that endear him to us but infuriate his colleagues, Devereaux struggles to endure and even enjoy the contentious characters who despise their jobs at this third-rate university, but like the campus geese are too lazy to fly away.The author, who taught at Colby College, has assembled the usual cast of temperamental faculty and incompetent administrators that devotees of comic university novels will recognize. There's an earnest young professor so devoted to gender-neutral language that Hank refers to him as \"Orshe\"; a modern theorist who rejects literature entirely and teaches only from videotapes of television sitcoms; a poet who communicates almost entirely by filing grievances against her colleagues. Here are the frustrated high school teachers and faux scholars who never planned to stay more than a year or two but grew fatally comfortable when the university was expanding and now find themselves trapped by their unmarketability.Surrounded by accusations of betrayal in a rumor-infested department about to lose 20 percent of its faculty, Devereaux has a deep, redeeming affection for his colleagues as he goads them into open hostility with his straight man routine.Even the unpublished poet who damages his nose with her spiral binder receives nothing but his benign understanding and ironic asides. \"People have only a finite amount of meanness in them,\" Devereaux observes, \"and most times they exhaust it quickly.\" Though the novel is unrelentingly funny, it is Hank's deep appreciation for his colleagues' humanity that raises it above so many other academic satires.Life outside the hallowed walls of the university is no more stable for Hank than in his panicked department. While he worries that his long-suffering wife may be having an affair with the dean, he tries not to offer advice to his aliterate daughter as her marriage breaks up. Running beneath this hectic week lies Hank's dread of his brilliant father's return. This repressed, but constant concern about inheriting his errant father's talent, selfishness, and illness, pulls the novel into the psychological depth that confirms the author's extraordinary talent for drawing characters.Russo writes repartee that crackles with wit but never slides into artifice. Though his characters are often struggling against deep-seated sadness, the force of his wit is enough to convince us that such pain and sadness are not inevitable or final.The feminist poet with the lethal binder finally admits, \"You may not believe me, but I've always liked you, Hank. You're like a character in a good book.

I enjoy the good natured wit of Russo and the way that he rounds off his story lines like a refreshing ellipse. His characters are fully drawn and unique individuals with eccentricities and nuances that distinguish them in their behavior and speech. My only criticism is one that Russo leveled against his own protagonist: sometimes, he is a bit too much of a \"clever man.\" I liked the leitmotif of Occam's Razor throughout the novel. One of his best characters is, unfortunately, a woman we saw too little of in this novel -- Henry's wife, Lily.

On reflection, it's clear that they're by the same author - the writing style, the characterization, some of the humor. But in many other ways they are nothing alike. Empire Falls sucked me in from the very beginning, but it took a bit longer for Straight Man to grab me. It was interesting and well written, but it wasn't until about halfway through that I suddenly discovered how attached I was to the characters, and how interested I was to see how everything turned out.

The delicious flirtation between protagonist Hank and beguiling Meg, for example, is perfectly done, but the real coup is the quietly astonishing relationship between Hank and his wife Lily.

Naturally it reminded me of my own 6 years as a grad student/adjunct professor in English departments, with perhaps even more backbiting than we graduate students were aware of. It seemed to me that the novel, set in an English department in the middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania, made excessive use of gags - our English professor hero donning a fake nose and glasses before the local TV crew and grabbing a duck by the neck and threatening to kill a duck a day until he gets English department budget; our hero's nose being mangled by the metal wiring from a spiral notebook wielded by a faculty enemy who smacked him after he made a disparaging comment about her poetry; and the stereotyped characters like the fiction student with his misogynist slasher stories, the sweet yet beleaguered department secretary who ends every statement with a question mark, the bimbo faculty wife who is always stoned and likes to wiggle her toes, or the youngest member of the English faculty who is so busy trying to be politically correct and gender neutral, often-adding \"or she\" to anyone else's use of the word \"he\", that he's dubbed \"Orshee\" for the extent of the novel. Writing these examples, the book does seem funny, perhaps funnier than I experienced it while reading. The cliche phrase \"It's funny because it's true!\" comes to mind, and that is perhaps the point, reversed: some of these characters were familiar enough to me that they aren't even funny anymore - merely sad - and the parts that are hyperbolic to what I've experienced in real life thus struck me as hyperbole - i.e. in this context, merely gags.While another cliche goes that \"we can all use a good laugh,\" maybe I just appreciate a more serious take on life -- and, to be fair, even the novel's other characters tell our hero that *they'd* appreciate a more serious take on life than his best efforts. Hank, our hero, is the opposite of the \"straight man\", though occasionally he sets himself up as the straight man so that someone else can get off a joke. It felt for awhile like there might be some important issues in this book somewhere, but everything was so lighthearted, so deft, that it was hard to take any of the issues seriously. Shrug.On this theme of comedy versus serious themes, Russo catches my attention about 2/3 of the way through the book, with our character teaching a lesson to his class. Hank, after his aforementioned threat to kill a duck a day until he gets budget for his department, asked his class to write persuasive essays arguing if he should or should not actually make good on his threat. (This assignment got a laugh out of me - I wish I could have given such an assignment to my students.) While most of the class turns in essays saying Hank should go through with his threat, he argues they're wrong:\"Because,\" I explain to them, without conviction, \"it was a comic, not a serious, threat. Because the man who threatened to kill a duck a day until he got a budget was wearing a fake nose and glasses. Because it makes no sense to carry out a comic threat to serious consequence.\"Needless to say, we end where we began, unpersuaded. My argument, that tragedy and comedy don't mix, that they must remain discrete, runs contrary to their experience. Indeed, it may run contrary to my own. These students have watched this very class begin in low comedy and end in something, if not serious, at least no longer funny. They file out, sullen, confused (268).With this, I have the sense that Russo is speaking directly to me, his reader: Pay attention, chica, I'm not just a funnyboy. Not that he seems to come down with a clear thesis about whether one can or can't successfully combine tragedy and comedy, but rather that he seems to be asking that we pay attention to the tension between the two.And the book does begin to carry more weight, as seemingly hyperbolic characters become increasingly more real, and thus more felt by the reader, as the pages turn. Russo's humor also begins to carry gravitas around the thesis that, with middle age stability comes an unstable longing for change -- even if that change might be disastrous to the one longing for it. We begin to see Hank's antics as simply a way to break out of the rut of his life. And, in a few moments of sincerity that juxtapose the humor, something truly poignant is articulated:I do not want to die. I'm as sure of this, I think, as a man can reasonably be. I do not want to learn, when I speak to [my doctor] tomorrow, that the asymmetry he thought he felt in my prostate is a tumor, and yet, there is a part of me that would thrill to receive such news. Why that should be I cannot imagine. Nor do I want the woman that I'm married to and that I love to leave me, but the thought of her doing so moves me in a way that our growing old together and contentedly slipping, in affectionate tandem, toward the grave does not. The thought of Lily's having found someone to replace me is not welcome, but an urgent new love--and what makes the world stranger than love?--is a thing that I could half-wish for her. For me (323).Why do I find this paragraph so moving? Because it's the first sincere thing Hank has said in 323 pages? Maybe. Do I find it all the more sincere because of this? Perhaps. And perhaps, too, it's because I can understand the sentiment, and it helps me to understand Hank's longings that have caused him to act so unseriously (the very thing I couldn't understand). Ultimately, it seems to me that the tension between this longing for change/alienation and the habitual comfort of stability/community is what this seemingly light and funny book is about. Hank's confession that he feels a thrill at the possibility of dire news is offset by his acknowledgement that we deeply rely on the weight of our existing life, to hold on to ourselves:The truth is, we never know for sure about ourselves. Who we'll sleep with if given the opportunity, who we'll betray in the right circumstance, whose faith and love we will reward with our own. [...] Only after we've done a thing do we know what we'll do, and by then whatever we've done has already begun to sever itself from clear significance, at least for the doer.Which is why we have spouses and children and parents and colleagues and friends, because someone has to know us better than we know ourselves. We need them to tell us. We need them to say, \"I know you, Al. You're not the kind of man who\" (374).Hank explains to us earlier in the novel that \"I know you, Al. You're not the kind of man who...\" is an exercise on characterization for fiction students - one I used in my own classrooms, when I taught fiction. \"He was the sort of man who still opened doors for women.\" \"She was the sort of woman who'd remember something you told her 5 years ago, and use it against you now in an argument as a sign of some moral failing.\" \"I know you, Al. You're not the kind of man who would claim to have read something you hadn't.\"The fiction exercise is useful for sharpening students' writing - to get at the essence of someone's character with only a few words. As a statement on us, we living human beings, it's interesting to think of how we're simultaneously supported and weighed down by the knowledge others have of us. I sometimes feel the longing to start all over, make all new friends and loved ones, and thereby erase all things from my past I'm ashamed of. But who would I be then? And who could I look to, to better understand?"}], "description": "In this uproarious new novel, Richard Russo performs his characteristic high-wire walk between hilarity and heartbreak. Russo's protagonist is William Henry Devereaux, Jr., the reluctant chairman of the English department of a badly underfunded college in the Pennsylvania rust belt.\u00a0Devereaux's reluctance is partly rooted in his character--he is a born anarchist-- and partly in the fact that his department is more savagely divided than the Balkans.In the course of a single week, Devereaux will have his nose mangled by an angry colleague, imagine his wife is having an affair with his dean, wonder if a curvaceous adjunct is trying to seduce him with peach pits, and threaten to execute a goose on local television.\u00a0\u00a0All this while coming to terms with his philandering father, the dereliction of his youthful promise, and the ominous failure of certain vital body functions.\u00a0In short, Straight Man is classic Russo--side-splitting and true-to-life, witty, compassionate, and impossible to put down.", "title": "Straight Man", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414298.Straight_Man", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430659357l/414298.jpg", "reviews": 2208, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7844.Richard_Russo", "name": "Richard Russo"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Humor", "Contemporary", "Novels", "Academic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414298.Straight_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1937730.Straight_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13535773-straight-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152509-straight-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/838384.Straight_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12362.Straight_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187020.Empire_Falls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/659388.Nobody_s_Fool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107821.Bridge_of_Sighs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6303733-that-old-cape-magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27068575-everybody-s-fool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
