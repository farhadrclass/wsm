But if one ignores the supernatural element suddenly the story becomes quite realistic. Liza and her mother live in a dangerous environment and appear to possess few resources. Their clothes are patched and they are happy when they get enough to eat. Put that way, it sounds like a situation that is all too common. Of course, most children face weirdos rather than witches, but is that any better?My elementary school was a couple of miles from our apartment. I got myself there on my own, usually taking public transportation in the morning and walking home in the afternoon to save the fare. Walking adds the danger of cars, but otherwise is about the same as the bus, which is likewise full of perverts, addicts, and crazy people (literally, people formerly in mental institutions who were let loose when the hospitals switched from in- to out-patient). My mother warned me as best should could and told me to be careful. In retrospect it was really quite unsafe, but what else could my parents have done? They couldn't afford a car, or to take the bus with me, and they had to work and take care of my younger siblings. I'm sure, although they never said so at the time, that they were not happy about exposing me to these dangers and worried while I was out. But world-wide the majority of parents don't have the resources to protect their children from a dangerous world. All they can do is teach them well and hope they come though as well as Liza Lou."}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "This is a delightful tale that has a strong female protagonist, Liza, and has a lot of humor. My only quibble is why did Liza\u2019s mother send her into known danger time and time again?! But each time Liza is so intelligent and creative, she gets the upper hand. Liza is a wonderful character and children will enjoy her immensely, I think.I love the little poems within the story, and I am wondering if they\u2019re from traditional songs or stories; I\u2019ll have to research that.The foods mentioned sounded delicious.The illustrations are wonderful: colorful and lush and detailed, and scary and humorous.My edition has a lovely note to the reader from the author/illustrator Mercer Mayer. He thanks the reader for reading his book, mentions he\u2019s written/illustrated over 200 books, and writes a bit about his growing up years and current life.This book had been on my to-read shelf, but I read it now because it's one of the North American folk tales for this month's picture books club at the Children's Books group."}, {"userName": "Ronyell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1169488-ronyell", "userReview": "\u201cLiza Lou and the Yeller Belly Swamp\u201d is a clever tale set in the swamp by Mercer Mayer, well-known author of the \u201cLittle Critter\u201d series and it is about how a smart and brave girl named Liza Lou manages to outsmart the monsters that lurk in the swamp. \u201cLiza Lou and the Yeller Belly Swamp\u201d is an amazing book about battle of wits that children will love for many years!Mercer Mayer has certainly outdone himself in this tale of cunning and bravery as it details the wild adventures that Liza Lou has in the Yeller Belly Swamp. Mercer Mayer shows Liza Lou as a strong and cunning female character as she is able to trick any monster that comes in her path and she never shows fear in front of any monster she comes across. Liza Lou is also shown as a well-behaved child as she always does what her mother tells her to do and she has so much knowledge about what lies in the swamp as she knows every monster\u2019s weakness and Liza Lou\u2019s character will surely teach children how being cunning towards bullies always works out the best. Mercer Mayer\u2019s illustrations are beautiful and hilarious at the same time, especially of the images of some of the monsters themselves as the monsters that Liza Lou encounter look large and menacing, such as the swamp haunt wearing a white sheet and yet has large feet and a bucktooth, but the monsters also look hilarious whenever they are shocked or frightened off by the tricks that Liza Lou pulls on them.Parents should know that the monsters in this book might frighten smaller children as some of them do look a bit threatening such as the image of the swamp haunt looking like a large person being covered in a white sheet and has matted black hair and is shown to be transparent. Parents might want to tell their children that there are no such things as monsters in real life; however they must be careful whenever they travel to dangerous places by themselves or they should be accompanied by their parents until they get older to understand the dangers of the world.\u201cLiza Lou and the Yeller Belly Swamp\u201d is a truly clever and exciting book that children who love reading about swamps and monsters will easily enjoy for many years. I would recommend this book to children ages five and up since the images of the monsters might scare smaller children.Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Crystal Marcos", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3489102-crystal-marcos", "userReview": "I read Liza Lou and the Yeller Belly Swamp and I loved it! The illustrations are fun. I really enjoyed the cover with Liza Lou standing on the alligator's head. I appreciate it more after reading the story and finding out what a clever little girl Liza Lou is. I wish I could think that quickly sometimes! I like Mercer Mayor's style and it brought me back to my childhood when I remember spotting the spider and cricket in his Little Critter books. I spotted a spider in some of these pages and I looked for the possum on every page. I love how the story read. \"Yeller Belly Swamp\" go ahead say that out loud and tell me that wasn't fun to say! =) I think others would definitely enjoy reading the adventures of this daring little girl and the rotten swamp creatures she encounters."}, {"userName": "Chenai", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2399802-chenai", "userReview": "My favorite childhood books.

The illustrations are marvelous - quite detailed with expressive characters. I particularly liked a picture of Liza Lou's grandmother clonking a ghost over the top of its head with a frying pan, and also a picture of the parson, his wife, and Liza Lou at the breakfast table. Great stuff!The story showed one girl's intelligence and determination to do what she needed to do, and her courage in the face of some scary stuff. But the one thing I didn't like: I kept wondering why her mother and aunt were sending her out into a very dangerous place all by herself!"}, {"userName": "Jocelin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2427708-jocelin", "userReview": "I think I read this book in the 3rd grade. There was something very familiar about this story. Anyway, I thought that it was a really funny story about a little girl that lives in the swamp and she has to outwit all of the dangers that come her way.

And each shows the protagonist using her wits to be able to escape to live another day with her trusty \"pet\" opossum who follows her along as she ventures out and about Yeller Belly Swamp. Although the writing was easy, interesting and quick for the reader there were other parts of the book that were questionable. First the characters were all colored while their clothing portrayed them as stereotypes that one would normally be faced. Although I am normally lax with allowing for those stereotypes depending upon the timeframe that the book was written it but the fact that Liza is in barely no clothing while even showing her underwear at one point was really the point that made me dislike the whole \"poor\" showing stereotypes. And furthermore two of the villains were light colored although the former did look like Critter from that same-named species. All in all it was a decent adventure tale but one that I just wouldn't recommend to other readers."}, {"userName": "Gwen Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70612246-gwen-lindsay", "userReview": "This was one of my favorite books as a kid.

I fell in love with Liza Lou and am still in love with her to this day. She was so amazingly smart and brave, and I longed to be like her.It was *the* favorite nightly read-aloud for my now grown daughter, Charlotte. In fact, I still call Charlotte \"Hushpuppy\"--one of Liza Lou's mother's terms of endearment.When I read this book to a class of children, a hush falls over the room. It really is magical. It's so fun to playfully embody the voices of all of the characters. It's definitely like a one-woman play.

He was my favorite author as a young child before I became hooked on Steven Kellogg. This is an entertaining story about a clever girl who outwits the dangerous creatures in the Yeller Belly swamp. She had a little possum friend who us not acknowledged in the story and follows her around in her travels. The critter books had a spider and a grasshopper that you could pick out on each page.

My grandmother, a third-grade school teacher, collected books that were banned from her school throughout her career, and this book was one of them.

Reading it with different voices was very engaging with my students. This is about a little girl, Liza Lou, who has to make a delivery to her grandmother for her mother through the swamp. On her journey, she ran into many different characters that were trying to keep her from getting to her grandma's house, but she is too clever! This is a great book to use with Reader's Theatre in the classroom; full of lively, fun characters. The students love to repeat the sing-song poem continually repeated in the story.

Even though the illustrations were beautiful and directly added to the text, I thought this story was scary. The monsters are drawn so realistic it seems as though they are coming off the page. As with typical books, the main character always comes in contact with the scary monsters and outsmarts them.
