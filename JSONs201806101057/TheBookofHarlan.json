I completed this book that read quickly over the course of a day. McFadden shares the ups and downs of Harlan's life and shares what it meant to be African American in the first half of the 20th century. Here is Harlan's story. Harlan was born on December 24, 1917 to Sam and Chappo McFadden (depicted in this book as Sam and Emma Elliot). The Elliots determined to make a better life for themselves followed the great migration north and eventually settled in Harlem. During their nomadic existence, Harlan stayed at the home of Emma's parents, leading to hatred toward his own parents. Whereas many may feel that Emma did not want her son, I gather here that she left him in her parents' stable care while she sought out a better life for him. The Elliots soon became mainstays in Harlem's life. Emma hosted memorable house parties, earning the acquaintance of a who's who in African American society, including the great Louis Armstrong. Harlan desired a life like Armstrong for himself and became a sought after guitarist. Alongside his new friend Lizard, the duo formed their own band, and rose to prominence within Harlem's circles. Meanwhile, Harlan found love in the form of Gwendolyn Gill, an immigrant from Barbados, who eventually becomes the mother of his children. This is the one section where McFadden does not tie up loose ends, accounting for a half star deduction in my rating. Next, Emma's closest friend the singer Lucille Hegamin arranges for the band to tour in France, altering Harlan's existence. It was not safe to be negro in France in 1940. Soon after their band's arrival at the Montmarte, Harlan and Lizard are captured by the Nazis and spend the duration of the war in Buchenwald concentration camp. Miraculously, Harlan survives whereas Lizard does not. He returns home withdrawn and having nightmares of the camps. Soon after the Elliots leave Harlem, hoping to put Harlan's nightmares behind him. In the last third of the book, McFadden touches on race relations in the United States over a thirty year period. I found this part to be fascinating because we generally just get a few sentence overview in history books. Harlan becomes an archetype for the black struggle and we see through his trials and tribulations where our country has come in terms of race relations over the course of the twentieth century and beyond.I found the Book of Harlan to be an engaging and quick read. I was captivated by Harlan's story and read through quickly to find out what happened to him. This is a labor of love as I found out that Harlan is Bernice McFadden's grandfather. She changed some dates and names, but otherwise gave us an intimate look into the life of her grandfather. A powerful read which I rate 3.8, I recommend Harlan's story to all."}, {"userName": "Lauren Cecile", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21468256-lauren-cecile", "userReview": "4.5 stars!! I had to take off half a point because of the ending which, without giving away anything, is contrary to what actually happened to an important Nazi figure. I don't care for revisionist history unless it's in a speculative work. Although, in retrospect, it could have just been the protagonist's reality.Bernice McFadden has written an epic novel about African-American life from the early 1900s to 1973. Apparently the novel is partly biographical, the main character being based on her paternal grandfather. It is not clear whether Harlan Elliott, the main character, based on real-life Harold Isaac McFadden, was actually a prisoner in Buchenwald concentration camp or not, but that was the main reason I picked the book up because I, too, wrote a novel about blacks in Germany during the pre-Holocaust Nazi regime. This is a rarely told, unique story, so its inclusion just added intrigue to an intriguing character. The imprisonment is just a small part of Harlan's life and the book expands the entire breadth of his existence, from before his birth to his ultimate coup de grace on the last page.I loved how Harlan and his family interacted with actual historic figures like jazz and blues musicians Louis Armstrong and Lucille Hegamin, Eugene Bullard, the first black fighter pilot, and John Smith, a cab driver whose arrest ignited a 5-day riot in Newark, New Jersey.It was also interesting to discover the concept of \"reverse racial passing\" where whites, mainly Jewish people, pretended to be black, especially if they were jazz musicians.I enjoyed the entire book as it was very readable, incorporated lots of historical context and had vivid characterization. I could actually see these characters in my mind's eye. I enjoy all of Bernice McFadden's books, but this one is one of my favorites."}, {"userName": "Lark Benobi", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading this book very much. I loved it. There is so much to love in these pages, and so much attention to history. There is a loving attention to characters and their foibles that I found very endearing. I cared a lot about these people. The story resolved itself in an ending that, although completely implausible, was entirely satisfying. It was that kind of story--a story where I loved the characters and wanted good things to happen to them. The book is much more about heart than head, but I just let it in, and let it be what it was, and let Bernice McFadden tell me her story the way she wanted to tell it. I was richly rewarded.The pace is breathless. I felt like Alice Through the Looking Glass getting pulled along by the Red Queen. Huge shifts in the story can take place in a sentence, or in half a sentence. Characters come and go and their stories are full of happenings and then they leave the stage. It's not a 'minimal' style so much as it is what I would call an \"intensely compressed\" style. This marriage of a simple semantic style with a global, historic, epic story was new to me. I thought it was a very effective way to tell this story, though, in which the history of the 20th century, in particular of African American social history, becomes the stage that these characters play across. This is my first novel by McFadden and I'm very glad to have many more left to read."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27261312-shannon", "userReview": "I was over half way through this book before settling in, which makes it hard to rate. The only reason I didn't quit the book is because several of my trusted reviewers gave it 4 and 5 stars. I'm glad I stuck with it because I really started to like it around page 195 and at page 278 I started to love it. Problem with that is the book is only 342 pages. Even before I started to really enjoy the read, I wasn't oblivious to all the wonderful historical tidbits sprinkled through each chapter. As with any historical fiction novel, what makes this one is the events that the author decided to incorporate. Bernice touches on several topics including: the Great Migration and migrants from the Caribbean to NYC, jazz history from the 1920s, a radio prank broadcast in NY in the 1930s , the changing face of Harlem and parts of New Jersey across decades, blacks in German concentration camps including camps in Namibia, and a 1967 Time Magazine cover highlighting ever-present strife between law enforcement and the black community. Unlike most historical fiction I've read, I felt like I should do a quick Google search on every name that appeared in the text for fear of missing out on a buried gem!By the time you get to the last page, it's almost like having looked at a timeline. I'd think she wrote a novel around a series of notable world and US events that she remembered from her past, only I know that many of the events occurred before her lifetime. Bernice doesn't hone in on any one historical event but gives substantive leads that allow inquiring minds to find the documented events with no problem.Holding all of this goodness together is the story of Harlan, a young man turned jazz musician who struggles to get on the right path. His reckless ways leave a trail of unintended consequences for many of the people he encounters. When I visited Bernice's author website, the quote that appears under her image is,\u201cI write to breath life back into memory.\u201d Well, Bernice, you definitely accomplished that."}, {"userName": "J Beckett", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22450975-j-beckett", "userReview": "Author: Bernice McFaddenPrint Length: 354 pages (Kindle); 400 pages (hardcover)Publisher: Akashic Books; Reprint edition (April 11, 2016)Publication Date: April 11, 2016\"The thing worse than rebellion is the thing that causes rebellion.\" --Frederick Douglass (printed in The Book of Harlan, page 281, Kindle)There are rare literary moments when a reader is given a gift so magnificent that it defies adequate definition; when Seshat embraces and guides the writer's pen and thoughts, leading them through overgrown, encumbered historical paths toward a promised land -- a place that is quietly pure, emotionally significant, and afforded to few. Fortunate for us, Bernice McFadden has ambled along that path, bathed in the elusive light of wisdom and promise and has stamped down the thorny and entangled frondescence so that the beauty at the end of that path may be embraced. Her hands and mind have indeed been kissed by Seshat.In The Book of Harlan, Ms. McFadden reveals the holy grail of conflict: a plethora of social, emotional, political, racial, and religious issues, marching into the controversial realm of each without apology. Readers are afforded the fortunate opportunity to commune with a literary presence (Ms. McFadden) endowed with an indescribably beautiful vision.The myriad of images in The Book of Harlan are vivid, and Ms. McFadden's love of subtle details burst like a floral symphony after a warm spring rain. The colors of each line, page, and chapter are explosively bright, and in her essential and historical brilliance, Ms. McFadden (previously I stated that she is in the class of Walker, Morrison, Angelou, and I must add Kincaid), presents the novel with the eye of a gifted cinematographer. The reader is, as a result, graciously endowed with an indescribable, and lasting emotional connection.At the start of the book, the reader meets Emma Robinson and the Robinson family. Quickly it becomes obvious that the family has some capital means and their confident, almost arrogant, air belies their acknowledgment of their good fortune:\"The Robinson family traveled the city in a shiny black buggy, pulled by not one horse but two horses.\" (page 3- Kindle)Their residence is a house reminiscent of the surreal, quaint country dwellings often planted on several country acres where the loudest sound one hears is the evening's wind. McFadden states that they [the Robinsons] lived among the Black elite of Macon; \"the doctors, lawyers, teachers, and ministers, and not a maid or ditch digger among them.\" (pg. 3)Emma is the youngest and the only girl. Stereotypic as a teenaged character, she seems to hunger for an existence of greater adventure. This 'hunger' she expresses in silent vividness by her admiration of Lucille, her friend and a jazz / blues singer who is offered a \"glamorous\" life on the road. Emma's strict upbringing and denial of these raucous endeavors, causes her to long for it more. Emma meets and confirms a mutual attraction with Sam Elliot, a good-looking, quiet and easy-going carpenter from Kentucky, and her life heads in a different and completely unpredictable direction. Sam is smitten and spends every possible moment in pursuit of Emma. His intentions are honest. His love for Emma is real. But, as would be expected, her family is distrusting.McFadden takes the story along the path of secretive affection and through the chambers of lost virginity. The Robinson family's resolve is tested by Emma's unplanned pregnancy, quick marriage, and decision to move (the first of many) from Macon to DC after the birth of she and Sam's child. It is after the birth of Harlan that the novel truly becomes The Book of Harlan.The short chapters are like staccato movements; breath, awakening, flow, ebb, pure, constant, short and intentional. Ms. McFadden provides intensity, conflict, resolution, and intrigue; most evidently beginning with the horrific, fiery suicide of Darlene, the sister of Harlan's best friend. Beautifully, Ms. McFadden uses Darlene (who is characteristically flat) as a powerfully appropriate apparition for the events in Harlan's life (my thoughts). In my opinion, she played a vital role in the tribulations of Harlan's life, including throughout his adulthood.Harlan opts to pursue music and drops out of high school. He joins and performs (poorly) with Lucille's band and is introduced to marijuana, under the promise from fellow musicians that it will make him play better. And it does.... tremendously. This sort of internal conflict from external influences is Ms. McFadden's sweet spot; the place where her glow begins to shine even brighter.Midway through the novel, Harlan befriends Lizard, a Jewish musician whose Blackish demeanor and period-influenced style grants him the ability to evade inquiries about his ethnicity. Their bond is quick, affectionate, and brotherly, and together they form a band. After finding and flexing their chops in the US, they are offered an opportunity to perform in Paris. War was declared at the time of their travel, and the climate of the book changes, becoming, at that very moment, far greater than the sum of its parts; reflecting tension and chaos, joy and pain, and a level of sorrow so massive that it remains, even in present reality, immeasurable. We feel, deeply, the details of this tension. Ms. McFadden ensures that we do; pummels us with a constant barrage of elation and fear; extracting the elements of each until there is nothing recognizable left, like a conductor building a crescendo from the quiet of piano. In the hush of night, after otherwise tense but ordinary affairs, Harlan and Lizard are accosted, bludgeoned, and abducted by Nazi soldiers. The novel, already very alive, transforms further, raising the reader's blood pressure and leaving them desperately gasping for air and clutching at the rocketing pain in their chest.Harlan's return to America after several years of unnerving events in Europe presents its own symphony of challenges. The many events experienced by Lizard and Harlan after their abduction, introducing to some and confirming for others the historically excluded conflict that occurred between Nazi soldiers and people of African descent, exceeds my ability to give it the justice it greatly deserves. Ms. McFadden packs the novel with so much of her magic that no review or critique could ever effectively capture its depth. With each word and turn of the page the intensity builds, and the transition and tone of the story, from this point to the very end, epitomizes literary exactness. And it is here that I feel more than compelled to discontinue my summary.There are no short cuts. Yes, this is a must read type of novel.This review/commentary has, for reasons I cannot explain, been the most challenging I have attempted. Perhaps it was the details within the book or my personal admiration for Ms. McFadden's work that made commenting difficult. Perhaps I made the greatest faux pas, by reading the reviews of others and commenting on their comments.Maybe it was because of this....I have never written a review by summarization or through extracting too many details from the story, but for reasons unknown I was entranced by a deep need to do so with this book. Perhaps, to me, Harlan is an exceptionally familiar character, reminding me subtly of my grandfather, or uncle, or a distant cousin, or the man down the street. Perhaps I see Harlan within myself; searching, finding, losing, and reborn. Maybe Harlan is many, or perhaps he embodies such layers of complexity that he is no one at all.Whoever he is to you is correct. His facets are many. Bernice McFadden and Seshat made him that way. After reading The (AMAZING) Book of Harlan, I am certain, with absolutely no doubt, that you will agree."}, {"userName": "Didi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682140-didi", "userReview": "Here's my video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWX-_..."}, {"userName": "Monica **can't read fast enough**", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1269784-monica-can-t-read-fast-enough", "userReview": "Although The Book of Harlan is about the life and experiences of Harlan, there are many other vignettes throughout the book that focus on the lives of other characters. I am very thankful for that because the other stories are what actually saved the overall story for me. I did not like Harlan at all. He was a selfish, misogynistic, womanizer who was careless with his words and actions. His selfishness extended to his parents, friends, and lovers alike. I did feel sorry for Harlan, because he survived one of the world's greatest horrors, yet I still just couldn't bring myself to like him as a man. He was spoiled by a mother who herself was pretty selfish, so part of the blame for Harlan's deficit in character lays firmly at the feet of his parents. Harlan's father worked hard and loved his family, but he wasn't the strong person in their family. Harlan's mother got her way in all things which was a problem from the beginning of their marriage straight through to Harlan's young adulthood.The Book of Harlan is written in very short chapters that carries the reader through the story extremely smoothly. I'm not sure if it tricked my mind into consuming the story faster than I normally would or what, but I felt like the story flew by in the best possible way. I was engaged from beginning to end, even while I was busy not liking Harlan. The many lives that orbited around Harlan were interesting and many times tragic. I had a much easier time having empathy for them and hoping that the more inevitable and realistic outcomes wouldn't befall them. There is a plot twist for one of the secondary characters that I didn't see coming and it served as a gut punch when it was revealed. Bravo, Ms. McFadden. That was a horrible but poignant moment in the story. McFadden's writing style is wonderful and I am happy that I already own three of her other books. I am looking forward to reading them soon.

I am glad that I was given the opportunity to read it. This is a remarkable story of a man who was born in 1917 - lived through the Roaring 20's, the Great Depression, World War II and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. All the tumult that occurs in the world during this time is reflected in the life of Harlan Elliot. Harlan was born in Macon Georgia and spent his early life there with his grandparents. When Harlan's mother and father finally came to claim him he was 14 years old. They moved to Harlem. At that time, in the 20's, Harlem was exciting and very cool. It was teeming with humanity and with music. The black clubs attracted white clientele. They came in droves to listen and to dance to the jazz, blues and swing music. Harlan's parents are right in the midst of this and they have musicians and famous people dropping in to their house all the time. Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie are frequent visitors and Harlan grows up with music in his heart and in his blood. He and his best friend, trumpeter Lizard Robbins play in groups and bands all over Harlem. The life is exciting, but all the pitfalls and dangers are there for these young men - drugs, alcohol, women and fast living. Their band is asked to go to Paris to play in a club there. The time is the early spring of 1940 and Paris is teeming with life. In a few short months though the Nazis invade Paris and start their reign of terror in the City of Light. Both Harlan and Lizard did not get out of France in time and both are incarcerated in the Buchenwald concentration camp. Harlan survives (barely) after 5 long years and is sent back home a broken man. The rest of the book shows Harlan's struggle to return to the land of the living as he feels dead inside after the hardships he endured in Buchenwald. There are many more struggles for Harlan as he tries to find himself and before he finds a measure of peace. Ms McFadden states: \"I write to breathe life back into memory\", and she does that brilliantly here in The Book of Harlan. A must read, especially for music lovers."}, {"userName": "Jamise // Spines & Vines", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13111928-jamise-spines-vines", "userReview": "ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! To say this is a \"must read\" is an understatement. Prepare yourself for a magical journey as McFadden catapults you into the life of Harlan. The short and impactful chapters kept me captivated as I devoured each page. McFadden's writing style grabs you instantly and she never lets you go. She exposes life and it's circumstances in a humanly raw magnitude that any reader can relate to. You are transported back in time and deposited into monumental eras of history. McFadden's prose exquisitely glides the reader through the Great Migration of blacks from the south to the north, the Harlem Renaissance, WWII, the Holocaust, the turbulent Civil Rights Era, the assassinations of JFK and MLK, Jr., ending with the tumultuous 1970s... a continuation of the 1960s. The beauty and gift of McFadden's writing is that you felt like you were right there in the era. I could hear the jazz bands, feel the sorrow/pain of the prisoners in Buchenwald concentration camp and see the fires from the 60's race riots. To make a reader \"feel\" is a gift and McFadden handles this gift with grace. I was invested in every character. I cared about characters even after they had exited the story. As I was approaching the final few chapters I literally closed the book and came back to it a week later. I didn't want the story to end. McFadden doesn't simply write; she gets into your head and heart, stirs your spirit and leaves your soul wanting more!This quote from the Washington Post beautifully describes the magical Book of Harlan: \"This is a story about the triumph of the human spirit over bigotry, intolerance and cruelty, and at the center of \u201cThe Book of Harlan\u201d is the restorative force that is music.\""}, {"userName": "Lata", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata", "userReview": "3.5-4 stars.

On the other hand, one may criticize this rushed tempo for being superficial and glancing over horrific historical events (segregation in the South, Buchenwald concentration camp, the rising crime rate of Harlem). This novel really packs on a lot of material. Harlan Elliot is the son of two black Southerners from Macon (Georgia), but in his teens he moves with his parents to Harlem. Jazz is blooming and I could even hear the music while reading this book. Unfortunately Harlan's innocence is easily corrupted when he hangs out and tours with musicians. His music career takes him to Europe which is in the middle of WW2. I will stop here and just say that WW2 is just a part of this novel. After the war we still follow Harlan's life into the seventies.This novel was inspired by the author's family. I mainly read this book to find out about blacks who were caught by the Nazis during the war. However, there is so much more to his novel. There is even a little about white people passing as black during the jazz age, because they would be taken more seriously as musicians. My first thought was, Rachel Dolezal, but I guess it's more complex than that. Unfortunately, I don't like how the ending was written. It was confusing and I also expected a re-appearance of Gwen and the boys, but it never happened.

I almost quit this book but I am glad I didn\u2019t. This book is really touched my soul.

What a voice! I started laughing at the blunt open way she faces some delicate issues and kept chuckling along to the middle of the book. As Ms. McFadden describes the life of the family of Harlan; she gives all readers insight to what is personal and public in their lives beginning 1915, and quickly moving forward to 1917 Macon Georgia where Harlan is born. The chapters are short, and that makes it easy to finish a chapter before going to bed or back to work etc., but each chapter is power packed even if the chapter is only 1 page. Harlan lives in Georgia, then moves to Harlem and we read about the good, the bad and ugly elements that go along with being Black, Musician and less than rich. Harlan and his band go to Paris to play music. Then the book becomes extremely dark. Just dark. The German occupation of Paris is nothing to chuckle at. The musicians prepare to leave. For the readers, it is too late to turn back, the dear readers are invested by now and so we have to endure right along with Harlan and his people. It becomes a different book and Harlan becomes a different person. And we all get through it together, readers and characters. Now we are battered and bruised and back in Harlem. We get through the turbulent 60's and in 1973 the book ends. Great book, I wished it were longer because I would have liked to know more of Gwen's story.

She uses very short chapters to great effect, it certainly helps the feel of the book as a fast paced page turner.Bernice's prose as usual is imperial and her storytelling skills remain on a superior level. The novel centers on Harlan and his coming of age, but there are a host of characters here including some actual persons. We follow Harlan from childhood to age of adult maturity and because the story crosses multiple decades it allows Bernice to riff on various historical incidents, including both world wars, Nazi occupation of France and the turbulent 60's. Bernice is at the top of her game with this one, with a heart warming ending that will leave a smile on your face."}, {"userName": "Maya B", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8154161-maya-b", "userReview": "4.5 stars. great read. this book was very detailed and fast paced. Its one of those books once you pick it up, you wont be able to put it down. my only issue with the story was I wanted closure to Gwen and the twin boys. that part felt rushed to me. Also, at the end of the story I really wished the author would have let Harlan tell his story in full detail of how he killed Ilse Koch also known as Andrew Mailer.After reading this story I really want to do some research on blacks during the Holocaust. McFadden brings to light a topic that I never thought existed.I am a huge fan of this author's work. Her writing style is flawless and effortless."}, {"userName": "Shomeret", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1842352-shomeret", "userReview": "I thought I knew what I'd be getting with The Book of Harlan by Bernice L. McFadden, and in some ways I was right, but in others I was wrong. Yes, this is a novel about an African American musician who is sent to a concentration camp by the Nazis. It's also about a number of other significant issues. When a book attempts to address so much, can it be successful? My feeling is that some aspects of The Book of Harlan were more successful than others.The portrayal of Harlan was the best thing about this book. He was the character who had the most depth. I didn't always find him sympathetic, but he did feel like a genuine human being. This is a historical novel that covers a long period of time. Since this is also a relatively short book, McFadden briefly mentions some names and events which lead readers inclined to do research to discover more about them. I usually find opportunities for research really wonderful. Yet sometimes McFadden's references weren't as meaningful as they could have been.Because I do research about historical personages mentioned in novels, I wondered a great deal about the incident at the end of the book. I think that Harlan was definitely suffering from PTSD which is an understandable consequence of his experiences. He wasn't entirely sane. Bernice McFadden used indirect references and implications, so we can imagine what Harlan was thinking and feeling at the time. I thought that was very well-handled. It provided a moving conclusion to The Book of Harlan. I still wanted to see more depth in characters other than Harlan--particularly the female characters. It was a good book. I learned about people and events in African American history that I hadn't heard about previously, and even an eye opening story about the well known musician, Louis Armstrong that led me to conduct hours of research. Yet there were missing aspects. Maybe The Book of Harlan should have been much longer.For the blog version of this review see http://shomeretmasked.blogspot.com/20..."}, {"userName": "Liz Janet", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet", "userReview": "I received this book for review from Goodreads and Akashic Books, in exchange for an honest review.\"On the outside, Emma didn't seem to want from anything, but let's be clear-she was starving on the inside. Not the coal-burning-belly type of hunger of the destitute, but he agonizing longing of a free spirit, caged.\" This book is the story of many people, not just Harlan, it just so happens that all those other people are connected to him in some shape or form. His parents, best friends, lovers, musicians, they all shape the story just as much as Harlan does,following for over six decades, and here lies the beauty of the book. It follows them through the years before WWI, to the Depression, all the way to WWII, and much after, with all characters trying to find their sense of home.\"The real monster were much closer than Mars. The real monsters were right across the Atlantic. They did not have black serpent eyes or tentacles; they were two-legged, two-armed, beating-heart beats who were methodically scaring all of Europe to her knees. \" This is a novel that will become critically acclaimed, everything from the wonderful writing, to the realistic characters, to the quickly paced chapters, and that will bring an audience thirsty for something new and old done well. ..........................................................................................\"...she would never have a boyfriend because she was spook black, ink black, turn-off-the-lights-and-she-would-vanish black.\" As I read this, and a few other quotes and references in the book, all I could think about was \"the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice\" and colourism between dark skin and light skin, and those standards of beauty. This is an extremely interesting topic, and I was enthralled to see how this affects so many people (past and present). I am looking forward to reading more books dealing with this theme."}, {"userName": "Sarah Weathersby", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2417010-sarah-weathersby", "userReview": "Can we say six stars? This is Bernice L. McFadden's best book ever! Her prose is stunning, gliding over an epic of horrific proportions. We meet Harlan's parents Sam Elliot, and Emma Robinson before he was conceived, while Emma was too innocent to protect herself. But they did the best they could, leaving Harlan with his doting grandmother while the young couple goes off seeking their fortune from Macon to Louisville to Michigan, returning home to Macon when Emma's father Tenant Robinson dies. When Tenant's estate is settled, Emma and Sam move on to Harlem where Emma's best friend Lucille a famous blues singer, has settled in a large home, with rooms to spare.McFadden weaves her story around historical facts of life in Harlem with famous singers and musicians of the 1920's. When Emma and Sam go back to get Harlan to join them in Harlem, he is at first defiant, but goes with his parents to New York where he discovers a life he never imagined. When Harlan learns to play the guitar, Lucille invites him to go on the road with her. But Harlan, who never has any personal discipline was often late, or drunk, until Lucille has to fire him and send him home.Harlan lacked discipline, but he did love the music enough to form a jazz band. He found his partner in music in one Leo \"Lizard\" Rubenstein, who could play trumpet like Satchmo. Harlan called him his \"brother from another mother.\" The band was invited to play in L'Escadrille in Montmarte in Paris. And so they went. Harlan, still lacking discipline, had a wild partying time in Paris, not aware of the Nazi invasion of France. (No spoilers here, it's in the book-blurb.)McFadden continues the heartbreaking part of the story, leaving me in tears. The story ends in the 1960's, the Viet Nam War, \"riots\" in the cities, Imamu Amiri Baraka (Leroi Jones), \"free love.\" And a wonderful denouement."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355054-david", "userReview": "This book snuck up on me. For the first half I thought it a pleasantly light trifle that couldn't make up its mind what kind of story it was. At first I thought it was a snapshot of a young lower-middle-class black couple raising a sensitive young boy named Harlan in Macon, Georgia, in the 1920s. Then after a setting change, a Jazz-Age Harlem bildungsroman. Then a freewheeling reefer travelogue as Harlan the jazz musician gigs across France. Then, unexpectedly and startlingly, a grim concentration-camp narrative.I had been enjoying the book so far, but this is where I really started to sit up and take notice. The story makes a few further iterations, each one less a brush with history than a portrait of a man traveling through it, as Harlan wends his way from infancy to old age.I feel like McFadden doesn't quite resolve the story in a satisfying way, and it feels like there should be more, but it also feels like that is beside the point. The Dorothy West epigram at the end of my story confirms for me what I'd been thinking: that the point is to experience a man's life with the quilt-like qualities that real lives have: they are episodic, sometimes funny but sometimes filled with grief, sometimes brushing with with history, sometimes retreated into obscurity.I felt a parent to the main character: being there before he was conceived, watching him develop from a boy into a man, watching his triumphs and his blunders, being moved to tears when he suffers. I did not expect to be so moved by this book, but I was."}, {"userName": "I Be Reading ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4984980-i-be-reading", "userReview": "** I won a copy of this novel in a Goodreads giveaway.**Simply put, Bernice McFadden is a master storyteller and there is not a book of hers that exists that I don't absolutely love. \"The Book of Harlan\" is no exception.
