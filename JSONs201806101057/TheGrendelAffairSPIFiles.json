Gone are the humour and total wackiness. Gone are the hungover/stoned elves, the gargoyles, the stoned/horny/sex-shifting cross-dressing leprechauns, the flying monkeys and the Disney porn princesses. Gone are the likeable male & female leads. Well technically they're still there, it's just that they've become BORING as hell. Gone are the hilarious scenes and great banter, too.\u25ba What made Lucky Charms such a great read seems to have simply disappeared. All that's left is your standard, investigative UF novel. And a boring one at that, with lots of useless blah blah blah. Ugh. This had fantastic potential but none of it was exploited. What a waste. I expected lots of fun and craziness but got a flat, lackluster story instead. Ugh again.\u25ba\u25ba Are you wondering if I'll give the rest of this series a try?

Buddy read begins Jun 15th on Buddies Books and BaublesThe SPI files wasn\u2019t on my reading radar at all until I read Lucky Charms a few months ago in an anthology with a few other writers I was familiar with. It was the story I liked the most in the anthology and I was totally ready to jump into Makenna\u2019s world of supernatuaral creatures and crime fighting. \n Now I work for Supernatural Protection & Investigations, also known as SPI. They battle the supernatural bad guys of myth and legend, and those who would unleash them.\nThe problem is\u2026Lucky Charms is a prequel but it was written a few years after The Grendel Affair was published. The writer put a ton of flirty fun and ridiculous antics in Lucky Charms and it was a whirlwind of a ride. The Grendel affair doesn\u2019t have the same sense of fun in it and the characters are a little stiff in comparison. That doesn\u2019t make it a bad book it just isn\u2019t what I was expecting and hopefully in the future novels she will have hashed out the chemistry of the characters, humor and flow a little better. I have high hopes for that since Lucky Charms was really written well.Not all is a loss though this is an interesting world and the story got rolling pretty well by the midway point. There is still some humor and really great supporting cast to round out the story. Mak and Ian had great Chemisty in Lucky Charms but started out pretty stiff in this. They do however start to have pretty good banter and a tiny bit of sexual tension by the end. Overall I like their partnership and how different they are but how it works together.\n I drew my gun from my shoulder holster, but before I could open my mouth to explain, Ian had grabbed my wrist in some kind of mutant Vulcan death grip, my fingers went numb, and then Ian had my gun\u2014all in about two blinks of an eye. \u201cJeez, relax, will ya?\u201d I tried to shake the feeling back into my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fake, a water gun\u2014well, a water gun loaded with tequila.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I grinned. \u201cAim for the eyes then run like hell.\u201d\nYasha the Werewolf driver was one of my favorite characters. He goes furry once a month and drives like a professional stunt man but seems to have a good heart and some fun t-shirts. He is also great backup to have in case of emergency.\n\u201cI stand guard,\u201d Yasha said. He got out of the SUV and pulled a sawed-off shotgun out from under his seat. \u201cAnd keep our exit open,\u201d Ian told him. Yasha grinned crookedly. \u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d He looked at me and his grin broadened. \u201cScream if something jumps at you.\u201d I tried for a grin; it felt more like a grimace. \u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d\nThe overall story arc was okay but didn\u2019t really get going until the second half of the book. This is an interesting spin using the Beowulf legend with Grendel. It seems that not all stories are just stories\u2026.some have some basis in truth and someone powerful have brought a Grendel or two to New York and hidden them in the city. Mak and Ian need to find them before all hell breaks loose and there will be no way to cover-up the existence of supernatural creatures. To make this ever harder they are cloaked in tech and magic so the only person capable of seeing them is SPI\u2019s newest seerer Makenna.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cloaking device. The thing\u2019s small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, and will conceal anyone wearing it\u2014from sight and sound. Eat your heart out, Romulans.\u201d\nI\u2019m a little disappointed in the story just because I expected a little more from the storyline of the prequel. There are a ton of Urban Fantasies out there lately and this reads like most of them. There wasn\u2019t a lot to set it apart\u2026.YET. That said there is plenty of potential in this world. I mean Makenna\u2019s boss is literally a Dragon Lady and she works with a Werewolf, some Half Fae, an ex-military-bad-ass hot as hell guy and a Blood Sucking Lawyer (he is a vampire so really blood sucking is an accurate assessment). There is a ton of as yet untapped potential in there.With most UF they are easy to read and it seems like a lot of authors don\u2019t find their stride in them until about book 3 so I will still give this series a chance until then."}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "This book came to my attention after I read, and loved, the Lucky Charms novella in the Night Shift anthology. Unfortunately this first full novel in the SPI Files series was not half so much fun. It lacked the same fast paced action, witty humor, and craziness that I loved while reading Lucky Charms. The Grendel Affair was not a bad book and it certainly had its amusing moments but I was definitely left with a sense of disappointment after it failed to live up to my high expectations. Makenna Fraser is the new Seer in the New York division of the SPI(Supernatural Protection & Investigations). With no combat training she is paired with experienced agent, Ian Byrne. Mak uses her Seer talents to identify rouge supernaturals and Ian deals with them! They deal with all sorts of supernatural problems and do everything from ridding people of gnome infestations to body-guarding leprechaun royals on a stag party. This time they find the have bigger troubles as a Grendel, straight from the Beowulf myth, has hit New York and it brings with it a murderous appetite! The story was moderately interesting, but never truly caught my full attention. It had plenty of amusing moments and some good action, but the pacing felt a bit off and too much of the humor fell flat. Mak and Ian were likable characters and while there was a bit of romantic tension between the pair I missed the sizzling chemistry they had in the prequel novella. The secondary characters were a decent bunch. I'll read the second book to see if this series can get back to Lucky Charms level, but if it does not show some improvement in the next book I'm likely done with it.Rating: 3 stars. Audio Note: This was narrated by Johanna Parker who gave a competent performance even if she was not quite as good as Angela Dawe who narrated the same characters to better effect in the Lucky Charms novella."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.blogspot.com/201...Quirky and energetic, The Grendel Affair is the first book which kicks off the new SPI Files series by Lisa Shearin, featuring a mash-up of police/government agent procedural elements with urban fantasy. Think The X-Files meets Men in Black -- except instead of aliens, Supernatural Protection & Investigations is in charge of tracking paranormal creatures and keeping the public safe from them. Unfortunately, they also don't have those handy flashy neuralyzers thingies to help hide the truth of their existence from the general populace. The book follows Makenna Fraser, a southern seer who moves to New York City to persue her dreams of becoming a world famous journalist. However, not long after starting her first job as a trashy tabloid reporter, she is recruited by the NY branch of SPI for her special ability to see through any kind of glamour, veil, spell or shield that a supernatural baddie can come up with.Mac's duties generally don't require her to be on the front lines, but a sudden string of murders by something not human puts SPI on high alert. From then on it's all hands on deck, especially when the murders are linked to a bigger plot to expose supernaturals to the world on the night of the biggest party of the year -- New Year's Eve in Time Square. Thousands more will die if the SPI doesn't stop their adversary in time, and the only person who can see through the disguises of the killer creatures is Mac.First of all, can I give a big yay for Grendel? Yes, we're talking the Grendel of Beowulf fame. The monsters that SPI goes after in this book are creatures like Grendel, probably even his descendents, and that is just way too cool. In a series that also features the usual fare of urban fantasy creatures like vampires, werewolves, ghouls and goblins, it's a nice as well to see a touch of inspiration from Old English literature and mythology.Other than that, this book is what you would expect and quite typical of the genre, complete with an action-filled mystery plot, a budding office romance, and clever snappy dialogue but without a lot of the snark. Mac is an interesting character, not being an outwardly kickass or sassy kind of protagonist but she is still very endearing in her reluctant-heroine awkwardness...to say nothing of her cookie-gobbling ways and the fact she carries a fake handgun loaded with tequila. Also, I enjoy the fact that her business partner and fellow SPI agent Ian Byrne is not the kind of arrogant, cheeky-posing-as-charming love interest I generally have the tendency to dislike on sight. These two are both down-to-earth and will be very good together, I can already tell.It's true that those who read a lot of urban fantasy probably won't find anything too new about the overall premise or story in this book, but The Grendel Affair is still a very solid introduction to the SPI Files as well as a promising beginning to the series. Those looking for a fun read will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Jody McGrath", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31857555-jody-mcgrath", "userReview": "I thought this book was great.

In 2013 I read Magic Lost, Trouble Found by the same author and calling a spade a spade, it was so terrible that I swore I'd never read anything by Lisa Shearin again. Three years later and I saw this book and like Magic Lost, Trouble Found it looked interesting. Thankfully The Grendel Affair is worlds better. Yeah it's derivative, yeah there are whole scenes which could have been plucked from the authors favorite movies, but honestly it's so much fun I'll forgive that. I'll even forgive that it was a little longer than it needed to be and the resolution was a little sparse. So, go into it with your eyes wide open.

Unfortunately (for me), I'm not one of those readers.Where other people see funny situations, I see only idiocy and stupidity. My fault, of course. But this made reading this book boring. I wanted to kick the SPI for being a ridiculous organization unable to train its personnel: this is a secret, super, paranormal agency whose only seer is totally (and I mean totally) untrained and uninformed. I couldn't find it funny. At the same way I couldn't find funny a clumsy, goofy and often stupid girl (and I mean girl), not when outside I was presented with Armageddon. She acts like a toddler wanting to wear her mother's heels. At a ball. With a robbery going on. And I guess this is the heart of my problem. I was presented a UF with a gritty and dark plot, but offered a writing style and characters perfect for a light comedy or fluffy romance. There was a too big dissonance for my tastes. Let's be honest, I wouldn't want to be in these people's hands if Grendel came my way. :DSo my take is this: you know yourself. You certainly know if this could be the perfect book for you.

I would usually give up, but I like Grendel Affair too much to do that....I usually do not discuss specific plot points in my reviews, but I am making an exception because I feel The Grendel Affair has gotten some unwarranted criticism. Makenna Fraser is a seer; she can see supernatural creatures no matter how they hide their nature. In her world, that is what seers do. They do not see the future, the past, or the road not taken. She grew up in Weird Sisters, North Carolina where her family vocation is law enforcement. She wanted to be an investigative journalist and went to college to fulfill that dream. She knows how to shoot a rifle at cans and deer. She is NOT a former Army Ranger, Marine, Navy Seal, or the Chosen One. She is an investigative journalist who, while working at a tabloid in New York, came to the attention of SPI. SPI is an organization that polices supernaturals and makes certain they are not noticed by the mundane world. SPI does not give their seers combat training because seers are viewed as precious commodities to be protected...they see the bad monsters that no one else can see. Mac is claustrophobic; a phobia is an IRRATIONAL fear. A phobia does not make one a 'girly girl.' A phobia does make one self-conscious and embarrassed at times, but phobias are not suffered only by women. While running, Mac trips over snow covered grave markers; that does not make her clumsy and a 'girly girl,' it makes her human. Shooting a rifle at cans and deer is NOT the same as shooting a gun at someone attacking you with a knife or 6 inch claws. If it were, then police officers and military personnel would not train to shoot at people attacking them, they would all hunt deer. I work with cops, and some of them are far from graceful, and they have phobias, and they call for backup, none of which makes them 'girly girls.'I thoroughly enjoyed The Grendel Affair, and am very pleased that book #2, The Dragon Conspiracy, is due out this year. Mac, Ian, Yasha, Calvin and the Dragon Lady are welcome additions to my urban fantasy shelf.Yes, I was correct! The Grendel Affair holds up to the reread test.

I was stoked to hear she had a new series, this time urban fantasy set in our world, coming out. That was \u2026 three years ago. This is book one. What happened?Life happened. The Grendel Affair came out during my last year teaching in England. No problem, I figured\u2014I\u2019ll buy it when I move back in August. Then August came around, and I didn\u2019t. I was struggling to get through the backlog of books that had somehow shown up in my room in Canada while I was away. I\u2019m still struggling to do that. (They\u2019re breeding, I think. Only explanation.) But when book three came out last week, I decided enough was enough. So I ordered all three books online, delivered right to my door.That\u2019s right: I\u2019m binge-reading this series the way others binge on Netflix.The Grendel Affair starts the series with high stakes already: something or someone is planning to let some grendels loose on Times Square on New Year\u2019s, effectively exposing the supernatural world. Oh no! If only there were a secret organization of supernaturals and human, perhaps a Supernatural Protection & Investigation(s) outfit. Nah \u2026 only a centuries-old dragon would be able to mastermind something like that.Oh snap.The use of grendels as monsters feels pretty original. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve run across those in urban fantasy yet. And Shearin spends a good amount of time establishing them as interesting monsters in their own right. They are mostly beast-like, but they\u2019ve got a sense of strategy to them. The grendels and their offspring are formidable foes, but at the same time they aren\u2019t so powerful that defeating them feels like a deus ex machina.Otherwise, The SPI Files is pretty standard fare: werewolves and vampires, goblins and elves (hmm, don\u2019t those sound familiar), ex-NYPD officers and seers and\u2014oh, what? Yeah, our narrator, Makenna Fraser, is a human whose only powers include a nose for investigative journalism and the ability to see through the veils and glamours that let supernaturals hide in plain sight. Despite this ability, she is still technically a human. I appreciate that Shearin chooses to give us a protagonist with so few powers (at least for now).Nevertheless, Mac might be the weakest thing about this book. Her lack of active power means she feels a bit like a reader surrogate protagonist-on-rails\u2014always being dragged around by the other characters, reacting more than acting. Let\u2019s be clear: not every urban fantasy protagonist has to be an awesome fighter, and a woman doesn\u2019t have to be able to kick ass to be \u201cstrong\u201d or progressive. But I want to see Mac do more than cringe and gripe at the various supernatural creatures around her. The tractor and the paintball gun were a nice start, but I hope she grows over the series into a more complex protagonist.That\u2019s the key, I think: over the series. This is clearly the first book in an ongoing series, and Shearin does a lot of legwork. In some respects it\u2019s less subtle than I like\u2014the opening chapter just showers us in exposition and backstory\u2014and in other places it\u2019s more delightfully ambiguous. For instance, Mac is pretty clearly attracted to Ian, but will she act on it? Who knows? Shearin had an intense love triangle happening in her other series, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a romance is on the books for these books\u2014but maybe it\u2019s not the one that\u2019s being telegraphed so heavily here.Now, despite laying ground for subsequent novels, The Grendel Affair is still a good standalone story. There is a sense of urgency to the plot, and it climaxes with a tense series of scenes and battle sequences that leave you breathless. I read this on a Saturday night (because I have especially exciting Saturday nights), curled up in a chair, just enjoying an action-packed story.With six novels already, Shearin has a well-established style, and it\u2019s in play here. Her voice and approach to description and characterization remain the same. That being said, The SPI Files is definitely new ground, and Mac is by no means a carbon copy of Raine. I can\u2019t wait to read the next book\u2014and unlike you scrubs who had to wait a whole year, I don\u2019t have to. Is this what the people just starting to read A Song of Ice and Fire feel like?

Recently arrived in NYC and looking to spread her wings, she is instead recruited by the SPI (Supernatural and Protection Investigation). Makenna is a seer, a rarity in the paranormal world that leaves her feeling rather cosseted by the agency. Kept on the side lines with no defense training, she even gets a pseudo babysitter in the way of her partner, agent Ian Byrne. With her ability to \u201csee\u201d the supernatural for what they are; no glamour, spells, or disguises can hide from her all seeing eyes, she finds the guilty and Ian arrests them. Being a bit of a klutz, Ian also has to save Makenna often as she literally falls her way through life. When a series of vicious murders is brought to the SPI\u2019s attention, Ian and Makenna find themselves chasing not one but two supernatural killers whose contempt for humanity and loud drunken parties has them fearing the worse as New Year\u2019s Eve is only a few days away. Grendels have been let loose on the city of New York and only some quick thinking on Ian\u2019s part and Makenna\u2019s ability to see the unseen can save the city from a massacre on epic proportions.The Grendel Affair is the beginning of a new urban Fantasy series by Lisa Shearin. An interesting mixture of legend, mythology, and a secret agency blend together to produce a unique story that is at times engaging and fun. Well defined characters, both of the human and paranormal variety, gives depth and plenty of maneuvering for continuing world building and arc development. The beginning starts out slow as Shearin sets up the storyline and arc; explaining character backgrounds and offering us information in the logistics of the SPI and the role they play in the world. Once it all settles, the action picks up dramatically and the story takes off.Makenna is an interesting heroine for urban fantasy. No real warrior type skills but an alarming amount of ingenuity. She knows just enough to hurt herself. She has moxie and I give her points for that. I felt her development was slow to reveal. She is the quintessential female who\u2019s tiny, cute, sweet, just enough of a mess to invoke an alpha\u2019s protective instincts, and cranks out more one liners then a Vegas act. She tries super hard but inevitably needs rescuing or manages to rescue herself through a series of mishaps that stop just short of killing her. While I found her humorous in the beginning, she began to grate on my nerves as the story went on. She never felt more than one dimensional to me.Ian was more layered and engaging to me. An ex solider, recruited by the SPI for his defense skills, he just screams of skeletons in the closet. He, correctly, judges Makenna as someone he will have to save more often than not. His characterization develops gradually, becoming more open and comfortable with Makenna as he gets to know her. I liked that he wasn\u2019t impenetrable and could be hurt by the factions he came up against. There is no romance between Makenna and Ian though you get the feeling one may develop later down the road in the series.Interesting secondary characters round out the storyline with a dragon for a boss, a Russian agent with a penchant for funny t shirts, a geek who can infiltrate any system anywhere, and a vampire lawyer who tries to keep them all on the outside of a jail cell. Multiple sub plots keeps the story running at a steady pace as the group behind the Grendel\u2019s resurrection is revealed.Shearin\u2019s newest release is a fun fast urban fantasy with a unique premise and engaging characters. While I wasn\u2019t blown away by this one; my issues being with the main character, I did enjoy the mystery and the world. I do feel that if the heroine can settle and find her niche, the series for me will become more enjoyable.RATING: C+"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/673557-donna", "userReview": "I liked the idea of using a monster inspired by Beowulf, but apart from that detail both the overall setting and the supernatural agency set-up felt generic.That wouldn't have been a huge problem for me if the characters were more compelling, but Makenna and company all suffered from a bad case of \"root for us because we're the heroes of the story.\" I couldn't push myself into caring about her at all, and she had no sense of chemistry with the other folks in the book.Mac's background and supposed skill set didn't always match her actions, and her employers came off as incompetent. (They somehow had a policy against training their monster-spotters for fighting monsters.) The plot's ticking clock wasn't as big a deal as it ought to have been either, because it was obvious that the villains wouldn't accomplish their reveal. So the stakes were basically about whether Mac would gain the respect of her coworkers, making it less than satisfying considering that I didn't like Mac.Lisa Shearin is a good writer with an interesting, distinctive style.

Lots of action but with a solid storyline to back it up. Mac is a great character. I love her sense of humor and her go-get-'em attitude. I also love that she knows her limits. She's not a badass but she wants to be. She doesn't do stupid stuff and she doesn't whine and moan that she's not as well-trained as the rest of the agents. She wishes she could do more and is ready, willing and eager to learn (just as soon as this crisis is over... that is, if she and her team survive). She's clever, resourceful and an excellent addition to her SPI team. I also like that her partner Ian, while protective of her, doesn't relegate her to the position of helpless seer. He reprimands her when it's necessary but also acknowledges her usefulness and lets her do her part to help the team. Lots of excitement here with some humorous moments tossed in. Very much looking forward to more in this series. This has been on my \"to read\" list for a very long time.

When I learned that she\u2019s started a new series, an urban fantasy, I grabbed the first book. And what a romp!The protagonist Makenna Fraser is a former sleazy tabloid journalist and a \u2018seer\u2019. She can see supernatural creatures through any disguise or magical veil. Now she\u2019s working for Supernatural Protection & Investigation agency (SPI), and her boss is a dragon lady. Literally \u2013 her boss is a female dragon disguised as a lady. As the equal opportunity employer, SPI employs many paranormals. Vampires, werewolves, and elves work alongside humans to keep the normal people of New York safe. Makenna fits right in the motley SPI crew.As she isn\u2019t an ass-kicker \u2013 she is small and untrained, the only seer in the agency \u2013 her boss assigned her a hunky partner, a bodyguard i.e. babysitter, Ian. Together, they investigate and take out bad guys. Or rather Ian does the taking-out and Makenna just points at a disguised ghoul or a veiled vampire, says \u201cshoot\u201d, and scuttles out of the way fast. She doesn\u2019t even have a gun, not a real one anyway. Her fake gun is loaded with tequila. But when shit hits the fan and a villain imports a couple of almost unstoppable monsters into New York for a spectacular New Year\u2019s Eve massacre in Times Square, Makenna has to keep up with the big guys. If she doesn\u2019t, the monsters would do the irreparable damage to the citizens of New York, her friends would die, and she would be out of a job. A resourceful girl from the hicks, she improvises: she stops an assassin with a tractor, fights vampires with cans of aerosole paint, and marks the invisible beasts with her paintball gun. For the entire length of the book, the action is lightning-fast and non-stop, tumbling in a circus acrobat fashion, seemingly random but skillfully controlled and directed, and the tension thrums like a taut string. Whenever our protagonists get a short reprieve from their heroic sprees, they replenish their weaponry, eat cookies and banter. And get their injuries treated before wading back into the fray again.The author\u2019s irreverent sense of humor made me smile all the time I was reading this tale, except when the characters fought for their lives. Then I was holding to my chair arms and cheered them on. I have to admit that all the characters are rather 2-dimentional, like in a graphic novel. There is action on every page and dialogue in bubbles, but there is no character development in this book, no room for it anyway, as the action scenes take all the available page space. But it doesn\u2019t detract from the pleasure of reading it. Not everything we consume should be a nutritious meal. Sometimes, candies are nice too. Here are a few quotes: \nThe vamp smiled, showing me fangs that were way too bright to be natural. Someone had gotten one or five whitening treatments too many.\n I tried to envision a dental whitening treatment for a vampire. An interesting picture emerged. Later on, the same vampire is running for his life from something bigger and badder than he is, and Makenna watches: \nSo desperate that he didn\u2019t hear or care that his pants caught on something in the street, ripping them when he scrambled to his feet. The vamp\u2019s fancy shoes found traction, and he ran across the street, slipping and sliding, half the ass torn out of his pants, showing the world one red-satin-boxers\u2014covered cheek. I dimly wondered if there was a Santa on the front, or maybe Rudolph. \n Another visual popped up in my hear, equally delightful Here is the heroine\u2019s own description of her size, in comparison with one of her friends and colleagues, a werewolf: \nHe\u2019d pause occasionally and raise his muzzle, letting the air currents flow over his nose that was the size of my closed fist. As far as fists went, it wasn\u2019t that big. As far as wolf noses went, it was enormous. \n I enjoyed this book more than many more serious volumes in the same genre. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "3.5 starsI really enjoyed Lucky Charms, the prequel novella to the SPI Files, when I read it in the Night Shift anthology last year. It was one of those stories that completely took me by surprise and it had me laughing out loud all the way through so of course I was looking forward to continuing the series. I picked up The Grendel Affair expecting a quirky and fun read and to a certain extent that's what I got but unfortunately it didn't quite reach the heights of the novella. In fact, because I reread Lucky Charms just before starting this book it was really noticeable that a lot of the jokes and funny one liners had been used in both stories. Had I not read them so close together I probably wouldn't have spotted it but it did take some of the enjoyment out of reading this book.The writing feels a little stiff at times and I didn't feel the same level of chemistry between the characters as I did in the prequel novella. The Grendel Affair was actually published before Lucky Charms though so that gives me high hopes that the author's writing style is already evolving and I'm hoping the rest of the series will live up to the prequel. The story gets off to a bit of a slow start which is understandable because the author is introducing us to a new world and a whole cast of characters, I'm always prepared to give the first book in a series a bit of extra leeway because of that. The pace definitely picks up in the second half and once it got going I did find myself really enjoying it.I like both of the main characters and enjoyed the banter between them but think the chemistry between them was better in the novella than it was in this book. Hopefully that is something that will continue to build throughout the series. There are some fun elements to the story and I'm enjoying the fact that there is such a huge variety of supernatural creatures to discover. Overall I think this series has a lot of potential and if Lisa Shearin manages to raise the bar a little higher then it could turn into another favourite.----------------Buddy read with the Buddies Books and Baubles crew starting on the 15th of June!

Luckily I then noticed the author quote from Ilona Andrews proclaiming it to be \"urban fantasy at its best.\" Well then I knew I had to read the blurb and more than likely the book, as she's one of my favorite authors and is very up front about giving out very few book recommendations. After reading this book, I whole-heartedly agree that this is one heck of an urban fantasy read that frankly caught me off guard. Sure there still is the feel of the procedural aspect as it does revolve around an investigative service, but it's paranormal, not sci-fi and I have to admit I wish the cover had more of that look especially since it had a lighter and quirky feel due to the clumsy narrator that was incredibly endearing. You just wouldn't expect that kind of humorous read from such a cover, and I'm a big advocate for the cover matching the content.Putting the cover issues aside, I really loved this book. Mac's character is awesome. She's so quirky and spunky, yet hopelessly clumsy. It was more than a little hilarious seeing her navigate through everything that was thrown at her, and her reactions had me laughing out loud. Trust me, considering some of the more gruesome aspects of this book, it's a true testament to Mac's character that she was able to keep things so light. The rest of the cast of characters were pretty stellar as well from Mac surly partner, Ian, to her Dragon-in-disguise boss, the werewolf Sasha, I could go on and on. Each one had their own unique personality that really shown through, making for the best kind of read. THE GRENDEL AFFAIR hit all my must haves for a great book. (Well all except romance that is, but the rest of the book was more than entertaining to make up for the complete lack.) From laugh out loud humor, to great characters, to an edge of the seat plot, THE GRENDEL AFFAIR is simply not to be missed!"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/163750-nicole", "userReview": "I won this in the Goodreads Giveaway, and I\u2019m glad I did. I honestly enjoyed it. The story is fun and entertaining, with lively characters, fresh-feeling twists on fantasy themes, interesting situations, good action sequences, and snappy dialogue. There\u2019s even a sweet little hint of attraction/romance.The main, POV character, Makenna \u201cMac\u201d Fraser, is a seer (she can see past magical veils) and an ex-paranormal reporter. She\u2019s newbie agent with a lot to learn, not an Amazon, which is nice to see for a change. Although she makes up for her lack of experience with creativity and determination. Mac\u2019s Southern origins give her a distinctive voice. The author does a good job capturing Mac\u2019s wonder and fear when faced with crazy supernatural situations for the first time. I also liked a bunch of the other characters. Mac\u2019s partner, Agent Ian Byrne, is a tough guy with some baggage who\u2019s also pretty darn nice, as well as honourable. Yasha the Russian werewolf is funny and fierce. The boss is literally the \u2018dragon lady\u2019--Vivienne Sagadraco is actually a dragon who disguises herself most of the time in a human form. But when she\u2019s in action as a dragon, she is really awesome. Kenji the tech elf is fun and appropriately geeky. Rolf the Viking monster hunter is an enjoyable addition to the strike team because he\u2019s so very enthusiastic. My one quibble is with a few too many recaps/repetitions of facts of the case.

She could have easily been replaced at any point within the story, both before and after the discovery of the doppelganger. How is it that after they know a doppelganger is present, they don't make any major security changes? Even assuming that doppelgangers have precisely the same biomechanics, fingerprints, DNA, etc. as their victims, even in our world, a standard security measure is ensuring that no employee swipes in twice without swiping out. Plus, given the existence of doppelgangers, SPI employees should have decided upon a set of \"secret questions\" that can be asked on demand with both true answers and dummy answers, where the dummy answers immediately indicate that security has been compromised. These questions should be repeated in a non-discernable pattern and changed regularly. Additional secret questions should be saved back for verification in extraordinary times.Doppelgangers were far from the only plotholes in the story. A few of my quibbles:--If you're going to use monsters to prove the existence of a hidden world, why use grendels? Since they don't have any superpowers other than strength and toughness, aren't they imminently explainable as a newly-discovered species or a genetic experiment gone rogue? --Why keep only one copy of the plans? Given that one of the baddies had the thumbdrive, why not make copies? And why on earth weren't the files encrypted?--Why abduct Ollie?--Why put his toupee in the refrigerator? What possible purpose could be served, other than alerting the SPI to danger?--Even the opening with the nachtgnome was irritating. Not only did it highlight Mac's staggering incompetence and even more impressive self-confidence; it also had an irritating logic fail: they had three bottles of alcohol. Three. Why did they give up at two?--While I liked the paintballing (despite its Dresden Files derivation), the use case is illogical. Why not spray the entire place with a wide-angle paint sprayer? Paint, water, or anything else would have made the monsters visible. There was no need for a seer or a precision shot except to make the plot more \"exciting.\"--Another plothole was introduced by the camera scene. Since Mac can see past the veil via camera, why did she travel with one group down into the underground? Why not keep the incompetent, untrained Seer nice and safe by leaving her at SPI Headquarters and using a camera? That would also give her the opportunity to supervise all of the groups at once. Seer skills working over camera shots just opens up way too many possibilities that Shearin didn't consider.--And then there's the tequila gun. Call me a pyro, but that's a perfect opportunity to set everything on fire.--Even the origin story is a little fuzzy. Why did they manage to pick up on the veracity of Mac's skills from a National-Enquirer-style story?

Lisa is also the author of the Raine Benares series. I have had the first three books of that series sitting in my book closet for years! I just can\u2019t seem to get around to reading them even though they look really interesting. So when I saw that Lisa was starting a new series, I read the blurb and added it to my list because it too looked good.And good it was.In The Grendel Affair, we follow Mac as she does her very best at her job as a SPI agent. She is a seer \u2013 a human with the ability to see paranormal creatures. She is relatively new to the SPI. Her original plan was to not do what all of the seers in her family have done and that is work in some way with organizations that handle big paranormal baddies. So she became a journalist. But apparently, you can\u2019t outrun fate and here she is, with the SPI, helping humans battle supernatural bad guys that only she can truly see.I know what you are thinking. You are thinking \u201cbut Julie, this does not sound like a completely new premise for a book series.\u201d Well, you are right\u2026and not. No, a police force that is only made to fight things that go bump in the night is not new. But the idea that they have a seer to help them along is and I liked that aspect. How Mac has to show them what they are dealing with is quite neat. The other thing that I really enjoyed in this book was Mac herself.This story is told from her point of view. She has a quick wit and snarky humor but she is also a little lost and feeling a little overwhelmed by her new job and the direction her life has taken. I love how she is not afraid of admitting she is worried or nervous. I found that all made her very real even though she is surrounded by a bunch of the totally unreal. Like a dragon lady for a boss. Literally.The supporting characters in The Grendel Affair were well done. I felt a bond to most of them. I especially liked her partner Ian. At first you feel as she does and that is that he is not her biggest fan. But then moments pass between them here and there and you start to wonder if you are seeing things that might prove that there is more than just dislike or even friendship there. He is your typical tough and gruff cop and he is really cool. Seeing his tender side here and there was a nice touch.The story is suspenseful and full of action. There are people and creatures dying by losing an arm and their head, Mac seems to be in two places at once (or is she just going crazy???) and there is a threat to all of the supernatural population of being exposed to humanity on New Year\u2019s Eve. Again, it does not sound all that new but it is. The creatures doing the killing are not like you see often and the story is told at such a great pace you can\u2019t help but get sucked in. It is a ride from start to finish and one that will make you anxious for The Dragon Conspiracy, the next book in the series, expected out later in 2014.I really was impressed with how Lisa told this story and how she wrote Mac. The Grendel Affair is a great read and one I would definitely recommend to fans of urban fantasy.4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Cathy ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526945-cathy", "userReview": "It had a good mix of typical UF elements done with an original spin, they don't all feel typical and the mix felt fresh, especially the way they're portrayed as characters.

There's a prominent Russian character, and one supporting character is at least partially Japanese. There's still a real lack of diversify in UF though, it constantly disappoints me. I liked the proper English dragon who runs SPI. And the chase scene in the cemetery where Mac ran down the old lady who looked like the Queen with a tractor was great. There was a lot of fun in this book. Ian, Mac's partner, was a bit of a bore. On the other hand, thankfully and wonderfully the book was totally love triangle free! I can see where the romance elements may get woven in eventually, but maybe not as well, and it's refreshing not to rush in that direction for a change and just let the world develop.And look, I even let it wait until the second paragraph to mention that the author's bio says that she has two spoiled-rotten retired racing greyhounds, and a Jack Russell terrier who rules them all, which is a pretty good reason to try anyone's book in my mind. If I'd know about that sooner I'f have gotten her fantasy books off my to-read list a long time ago. I know, my priorities are predictable.
