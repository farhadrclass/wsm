One of the absolute best parts of being a book blogger/reviewer is the exposure you get to so many amazing authors you wouldn\u2019t otherwise be exposed to... this book is a perfect example of that.... I\u2019ve never read anything by Nicola may, But I can guarantee I will take every opportunity offered to read more books from her.... I like my romance with a touch of humor, a lot of fabulous characters, and a beautiful setting.... this book had all that and the added bonus of some mystery....Rosa has had a tough life, so when she is offered the opportunity to move to Cockleberry Bay and reopen a corner shop... she thinks this might be a perfect opportunity to get her life straight.... The catch... she can\u2019t sell the shop she needs to give it to somebody who is worthy (when it is time) and also she has no idea who has gifted this to her.... Rosa really had a complete transformation throughout this book, it was so lovely to see... she started out with such thick walls around her, you wondered if there was any way she would be happy in a town where everybody knew everything about you.... and she grew into such a charming person with so many wonderful and Corky friends.... she also has the most adorable dog Hot\ud83d\udc3eThere is also romance in this book... but you aren\u2019t quite sure who the love interest is until towards the end.... I had my clear favorite, so I don\u2019t really want to describe them because I probably will give it away.... just know there is not a love triangle, and you really want Rosa to make a certain choice (well at least I did).... as I mentioned above there is also some mystery in this book... who gave the corner shop to Rosa? Who was involved in the hit and run accident? And what happened to that necklace?Strongly recommend to fans of Romance with some humor, wonderful quirky characters, and a touch of mystery...*** thank you so much to Nicola May and Rachel at Rachel\u2018s Random Resources for a copy of this wonderful book ***"}, {"userName": "Dash fan ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61989809-dash-fan", "userReview": "5\u2606 This Gorgeous Story has it all...

About men, she has another saying: \u201cKeep their stomachs full and their balls empty,\u201d but that\u2019s not quite so poetic, is it?\u2019A boomerang always returns to the person who throws it. Karma will get him in the end.My Review:This was my first time reading the talented and witty Nicola May, although reading her clever arrangements of words will most likely become a habitual practice. I frequently smirked and occasionally cringed as her writing has a bit of everything, entertaining and engaging storylines, saucy banter, amusing humor, witty quips, adorable animals, heartbreak, painful insights, duplicity, and most importantly - quirky and endearing yet flawed characters who could have a college degree in bad decision making. Ms. May cunningly captured both the good and bad elements of small-town living from the predatory abuse of gossip and intimidation, pettiness, and snooping; to the empathetic and caring concern, supportiveness, and comradery in times of need. I fell in love with a tiny dachshund cleverly named as Hot Dog, as he was stolen as well as a sausage. I hope Ms. May brings us back to this quaint little town; there would be no shortage of peculiar characters and adventures to annotate. Which brings me to the new addition to my Brit Vocabulary Word List of full-on (maximum) and chuffed (mightily pleased). I would be full-on chuffed to return to Cockleberry Bay."}, {"userName": "Whispering Stories", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20354973-whispering-stories", "userReview": "Book Reviewed by Stacey on www.whisperingstories.comRosa Larkin has been left a corner shop in Cockleberry Bay, Devon, in the will of an unknown person. She has also been left \u00a32000, and a letter telling her that she cannot sell the shop, she can only pass it on to someone worthy.It came as a complete shock to Rosa, as she has no family, due to being brought up in foster care, nor know of anyone who cared about her enough to do something like this for her.Heading from London to Devon, she decides to give it a go at being a shop owner. However, she finds the village of Cockleberry suffocating as all the villagers know one another and like to interfere in other peoples lives.Will Rosa be able to cope, not only with running a shop but with people being overbearing when she is used to being alone?I wasn\u2019t too sure what I was going to make of this book at the start. A couple of chapters in and Rosa had complete and utterly got on my nerves. She wasn\u2019t an instantly likeable character, but as I carried on I found that I started warming towards her. Having been brought up in foster care, she learned to put up this wall around her and not let her emotions be on show, only allowing people to see the tough exterior. Over time this wall did come down, and it was nice to see the sweeter side of her.For me, \u2018Hot\u2019, her little Sausage Dog, stole the show. Wherever Rosa went, Hot went too. He was so adorable and I enjoyed him being in nearly every scene.The book has a lot of depth to it and a vast array of mainly wonderful characters. The setting is gorgeous, right on the beachfront in Devon. Old-fashioned shops, a proper tourist area, with a heart and soul to accommodate everyone.It was a quick enjoyable read.

I just didn't want to put it down, I was so absorbed by Rosa Larkin's story. There is far more to this book than meets the eye, I know what you are thinking, its another shop with inheritance books, some conditions stuck on it, and moving to a new place sort of thing. Well yes the book does contain that but its the way the story proceeds from there that is what makes it so special. I loved Rosa who has had a tough childhood, and never really been that responsible suddenly has a shop, her own home and a new village to become who she was meant to be. She has her problems, but also is very determined to make this unexpected gift a success. She also has Hot the Dog, otherwise known as Mr. Sausage who is utterly adorable and isn't far from the action at all. He is an adorable dog and certainly understands the W word that all dogs love! This is a romantic comedy so you may be wondering why I haven't mentioned men yet, and that is because for a large amount of the book although I knew who my heart was going to set Rosa up with, there were many other prospective males, so I don't want to name any of them, and leave you to fall in love with one yourself, while potentially being disgusted by others. I love the group of friends that Rosa starts to make, and there are some real characters that live in Cockleberry Bay, including the owners of The Lobster Pot, Queenie, Titch, and a few others who may not be as pleasant. There are laughs to be had, some sadness, and overall I was left utterly bereft that my short time in Cockleberry Bay was over so soon. I loved the book that much, and want to be back there with my new found friends already. Incredibly well written, this book has completely got under my skin, highly recommended.

Growing up in one care home after another, she learned to be strong and to stay away from commitment. Other than her best friend Josh and her rescued little pooch Hot Dog, Rosa doesn't feel connected with much else in her life. So when she discovers that somebody has left her a shop in the beautiful setting of Cockleberry Bay, she is stunned but more than up for the challenge, and a challenge it will certainly be. From an old store that needs to be whipped into shape, to the bustling and nosy community who know everything about everyone, Rosa finds herself on a whole new adventure with new friendships, secrets, and even the possibility of love but will she ever find out about her past and who she really is?This novel is brimming with humour but it is also so much more than that. There is a real level of depth to all of these characters but especially Rosa's and I desperately wanted her to learn about her past so she could allow herself to open up to those that deserve her love and friendship. This story has plenty of drama and it deals with serious topics but the pervading sense of strength and spirit is never dampened. THE CORNER SHOP IN COCKLEBERRY BAY by Nicola May is a fantastic read and I would love to see more from this community (and Hot Dog, of course!).

And it couldn't have come at a better time as she's just walked out on yet another job so she has nothing to lose in packing up all her things - and Hot her loyal sausage dog! - and heading to Devon to find out more about this shop, the area and why, and more importantly who, has left her this shop and flat.She soon finds she's at the centre of attention in this quaint tourist village, something she isn't used to, but soon finds some trustworthy new friends, and some who are not so nice! Her friend Josh, who she lived with is busy with his life, but is always there for her on the phone or for a visit to help her settle in - he's her voice of reason when she wonders where her life is going and what she should do.As she clears up the flat that has laid empty for so long, she uncovers quite a few secrets and as she settles down to village life she starts to relish life as a shop owner and the new challenges that this brings her way.

She has non-important jobs and rents a room from Josh. Josh and Rosa have become close friends and tell each other everything. Josh is probably the only one who knows much about her. Rosa had a tough childhood. She was taken away from her mother and was placed into foster care. When Rosa gets a surprise visit from a solicitor, who has a closed briefcase for her, she is shocked. The lock on the briefcase can only be opened with the numbers of her birthday. Rosa has no known family members, so who could have named her in their will?Rosa inherits a corner shop in Cockleberry Bay. She never had anything that was solely hers, so having her own store and place means a lot to Rosa. There are two rules that apply when accepts the corner shop, Rosa can't sell the shop and she can only pass it on to someone who really deserves it. Rosa leaves London behind and is determined to make the business a success again. Living in a small town like Cockleberry Bay will be challenging for Rosa, who's only used to big and vibrant cities. She gets a lot of support from most locals, but not everybody is thrilled with her as the new owner of the corner shop. Will Rosa have what it takes to get the shop up and running again?Rosa hasn't had an easy life and this has a huge influence on how she sees herself and the world. She never thought much of herself and has never opened her heart to love before. Now that she owns the corner shop with her own apartment above the store, Rosa gains strength and grows as a person. She's such a kindhearted woman and her creative ideas are fabulous. Rosa isn't completely alone, she has a little dachshund named Hot. I absolutely adored that little dog and his name made me laugh out loud. I loved to read about Rosa's journey and enjoyed witnessing the way she slowly turns into a responsible adult. I was wishing hard for her to find the love of her life. The Corner Shop in Cockleberry Bay is a heartwarming story about love, finding new friends and family secrets. There are a lot of mysteries surrounding Rosa inheritance and I couldn't wait to find out who made her a beneficiary. Nicola May gives the right amount of information at the right time and she kept me guessing until the last pages. I love it when an author can surprise me like that.

Whether it\u2019s her slight scattiness, her love for little sausage dog Hot or the fact that she embraced the huge life change that came with inheriting the corner shop in Cockleberry Bay, possibly a combination of the lot I adored her as a main character.From her first moments in Cockleberry Bay I wanted to run away to join her, living by the sea is my absolute dream and I couldn\u2019t imagine anything better than the chance to reinvent myself somewhere new. But boy, does Rosa need every ounce of savvy she has to get through her first weeks in the bay. Between letchy locals, a mad local landlady, a possibly psychic old lady, a dramatic hit and run and a misbehaving journalist she definitely has her hands full.Thankfully there are some joys on hand in the form of delicious rugby hunk and former landlord Josh, local barmaid and girl about the bay Titch and of course the ever faithful Hot.I found myself utterly absorbed into life on the bay and felt genuinely sad when things came to an end. Character driven novels are one of my best things in life, and this book was full of fantastic characters.Titch had a special place in my heart, she was cheeky and mischievous but with a complete heart of gold. I could imagine spending an evening sitting on a balcony with a bottle or two of wine with her putting the world to rights. Her fierce loyalty was one of the things I loved most about her, and I adored watching her character develop throughout the book.Even characters we were meant to dislike, easily captured me and I found myself wanting to know more about them, even if it was purely to dislike them more. This is what true character writing is about, making us want to know more about each character even if we hate them.The scene setting in this book is also something I adored, I could so easily imagine myself walking down the main street to the beach for a long walk and then meandering back up the hill to enjoy a drink and maybe some food at The Lobster Pot. I could almost see the view from the balcony, and smell the sea air. Well done Nicola for making Cockleberry Bay the place I want to escape to.From start to finish this story had me hooked, I loved that for a romance novel it wasn\u2019t the sole element of the story. I was absolutely routing for one man in particular who I personally would have chosen in a heartbeat. But this book was so much more than a romance story it was a story of finding yourself, realising truths and learning who your true friends are. I felt it was genuinely a story about life, about those lessons we all learn as we grow older and that\u2019s why I think it spoke to me.An absolutely wonder of a book and my first Nicola May novel, but if this is the standard I have to look forward to it will definitely not be my last."}, {"userName": "Allie Bock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77159359-allie-bock", "userReview": "The Corner shop on cockleberry bayThank you to the author, publisher, and Rachel's Random Resources for this ARC.

If anyone deserves a break, it's Rosa, and my fingers were firmly crossed that she grabbed her chance of happiness with both hands.I loved the mystery surrounding the inheritance and the villagers who were both endearing, annoying and unique all at the same time.

The biggest surprise is when Rosa inherits the corner shop and moves in from London. Rosa thinks she is pretty worldly because she has had to fend for herself since she was a little girl. It was interesting to watch her open up and develop new meaningful relationships. Rosa herself was a tough one to like. Besides being a dog lover, she had made some shaky decisions in the beginning that I couldn't get behind. But she grew on me as the story unfolded.The story itself had lots of twists and turns. Some of them were easy to see coming and some were unexpected. Overall, I had an enjoyable experience reading it. It was one of those books that left me pondering about it for the rest of the day.It definitely gets a 4 paw rating as it had suspense, romance, character growth, and of course a Dachshund!Trigger warning: This book touches on rape and alcoholism."}, {"userName": "Amanda ChocolatePages", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35873076-amanda-chocolatepages", "userReview": "The Corner Shop in Cockleberry Bay is typically Nicola May brilliance. Her plot, characters and portrayal of chick lit escapism is perfect. Nicola\u2019s writing pulls the reader right into Cockleberry Bay so that we can feel the cold air and smell the sea air and sandy beaches of Devon. We can feel the warmth of some of the characters and the bitter taste of others. As you can tell I loved this book. I was engrossed in Rosa and Hot\u2019s life, decisions, highs and lows. The main character Rosa inherits a shop from an unknown benefactor. So she and her beloved dog Hot travel down to see the shop and investigate what could be her new life. Here the adventures begin, with new people to meet, adventures and trials to keep Rosa and the reader intrigued. This isn\u2019t the kind of chick lit book that you can predict exactly what will happen. There are surprises throughout the book. I kept wanting to read more and see how Rosa would manage, what she would do next, and who out of the new people she meets would she trust or avoid. There is a brilliant set of side line characters in Cockleberry Bay, and along with Rosa we have to decide which ones are nice and which are nasty!Rosa has had a tough life, and I like that Nicola May is able to show Rosa\u2019s nature which would depict such emotions from a scarred life. Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.\u201d \u2013 Khalil Gibran. I can relate to Rosa, she is a girl after my own heart! She loves a J D and Coke, and has an outlook on life which shows strength and an awareness that life is not fair, but you have to make the best of what you have. Rosa grows throughout the book, and character growth and believe-ability shows the talent of an Author who knows lifes ups and downs and can write it so.\u201cLife isn\u2019t black and white, Joe. There is no rule book \u2013 well apart from the one bloody society throws at us\u201d. \u2013 (I hear you Rosa and Nicola!). In any review of this book, there has to be a mention of the co-star main character, Hot the little sausage dog is adorable and Rosa\u2019s love, companion and pride and joy. You can see Hot on the cover of this book, but you will have to read it to find out the double entendre of his name and more cute-ness from the lovely sausage.If I had read this book as a mystery book and you didn\u2019t tell me who the Author was, I would take a guess that it was written by Nicola May! I love her writing style, her ideas and the way she invents her characters that come to life in the readers head. If you haven\u2019t read Nicola May\u2019s books before, read this one\u2026..and the go read all her others. 5 out of 5 stars brilliant."}, {"userName": "Grace J Reviewerlady", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10627253-grace-j-reviewerlady", "userReview": "This is the tale of Rosa, a young woman with no family who lodges in her friend Josh's house in London.

She has been gifted a shop! With nothing to lose Rosa heads off to try to make a go of what is the legacy of an unknown benefactor. What with this unknown factor, the beauty of Cockleberry Bay and the drama that quickly ensued this book was really a lesson in how to write chick lit that has so much going on you don\u2019t have time to stop reading! I\u2019ll be honest, I wasn\u2019t always too sure of Rosa, she\u2019s a bit of a departure from the usuals, she\u2019s very open which is a nice way of saying she\u2019s loud, pushy and brash, and yet that made her fit into Cockleberry Bay even more, as they weren\u2019t averse to telling it how it is either.It also made you feel for her that little bit more when she let her guard down when things fell apart, and wow, did they! With a myriad of romantic possibilities, Rosa is beyond unlucky in love, although she doesn\u2019t mind that, she\u2019s never been looking for \u2018The One.\u2019 As well as that, the people in Cockleberry Bay aren\u2019t too quick to bring her into their fold and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done in the new shop. Saying that there were also some helpful characters to pull her up and of course a special mention has to go to her great little dog \u2018Hot!\u2019 The antics and mysteries in this were brilliantly done and interspersed with gorgeous settings. It was a very busy book, what with trying to work out who people were, figure out who\u2019d knocked down one person and who\u2019d got another pregnant, as well as the one burning question, who gave Rosa the shop in the first place?The book is told in third person and mainly from Rosa\u2019s pov, although we\u2019re lucky enough to hear other people in it too. All in all, pretty much my type of chick lit in terms of being very soap opera-ey and crazy, with so many threads running through it that made me want to salute the author for her braveness. It wasn\u2019t always my cup of tea, just because I can be a bit of a prude and amn\u2019t too much of a fan of cursing either but that was who Rosa is really! Whoever loves this will seriously heart it, and I hearted most of it myself!Rating: 4.5/5"}, {"userName": "Nicola Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/296328-nicola-smith", "userReview": "Wow, this book is fantastic. I thought it might be a sweet read, but it completely exceeded my expectations and, although it has some sweet bits in it, it's much more than that. Rosa Larkin has inherited the Corner Shop in Cockleberry Bay. Nothing that unusual really except that she has no idea who left it to her, or why. Rosa's had a tough time and it is a chance for her to make a go of something, especially as there is a condition that she can't sell the shop. So off she goes to Cockleberry Bay, leaving behind her landlord/flatmate/friend with benefits, Josh.Cockleberry Bay is one of those places where everybody knows everybody else's business. That's hard for a girl used to London where so much is anonymous. But she makes friends and starts to settle in nicely. There are some great people and some not so great in the Bay, and I liked the fact that it wasn't all nicey-nicey. I have to say that one of my favourite characters was the one Rosa left behind - Josh. But he appears plenty in the story so I was pleased about that.\t I loved Mary, and also Jacob and Raffaele, who were all a massive support to Rosa. And Rosa herself is a fantastic creation - so feisty, so no-nonsense, so much fun and I can't fail to mention Hot, Rosa's sausage dog. What a fab little dog and friend to Rosa he was.I love books set in and around shops so all the details about the Corner Shop were right up my street. There's a mystery for Rosa to solve regarding who left it to her and I loved how it all came together, particularly the fabulous ending.This book was just a complete and utter pleasure from start to finish. It has a beautiful setting by the sea in Devon, a fabulously prickly protagonist, some gorgeous men for Rosa to fall for, a shop, a cute dog and some fab supporting characters. It has it all! I was sorry when it ended and would love a return to Cockleberry Bay, perhaps focusing on another character (one, in particular, immediately springs to mind)."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5492096-sharon", "userReview": "Thank you to the author and Rachel from Rachel\u2019s Random Resources for this review copy given in exchange for an honest review.\u00a0 Also thank you to Rachel for organising the Blog Tour and giving me the opportunity to be part of it.My first Nicola May book, I ashamed to say!\u00a0 When I went looking to see what other books she had written I noticed I bought one from Amazon several years ago, but had never got round to reading it.\u00a0 Needless to say, that one will be bumped up the To Be Read list!We meet Rosa Larkin.\u00a0 Rosa lives in London, bunking in with her handsome, rugby playing friend, Josh.\u00a0 She\u2019s pretty much down on her luck with no money, no job and only the odd occasional sexual encounter with her landlord, until one day she inherits a corner shop in a little Devon village.\u00a0 She has no idea who has left her the property but there is one stipulation to it \u2013 it cannot be sold, only passed onto someone who really deserves it.\u00a0 After visiting the quirky little village, Rosa finds all the locals are a bit odd but decides to move into the flat above the shop with her little canine friend, Hot the Dog.\u00a0 She needs to think of what she can sell in the shop and get it up and running, but can she do it all on her own?\u00a0 And there\u2019s still the question of who left her the shop in the first place?I was keen to read this book, the cover got me right from the moment of seeing it \u2013 I mean, who could not want to read a book with a cute little Daschund dog on the front!\u00a0 The story was very entertaining and I loved Rosa\u2019s character!\u00a0 She\u2019s certainly not a girl who beats around the bush with what she wants to say!\u00a0 She flutters her eyelashes at most of the eligible (and not so eligible) men in the village, and is certainly not afraid to give them a run for their money in the innuendo stakes!\u00a0 Some of the flirting she was doing was so funny I nearly spat my tea out across my kindle!\u00a0 I also loved Josh\u2019s character.\u00a0 The \u2018will they, won\u2019t they\u2019 story was kept going throughout the book and you just so hoped that it was going to be a happy ending as they were perfect together.The villagers were all a little strange and it was obviously the type of village where everyone knows everyone\u2019s business, and if they don\u2019t know it they will make it their mission to find out through any means possible.\u00a0 I did wonder at some point though whether it was turning into a \u2018magical\u2019 story as a couple of the villagers were very much into fortune telling and crystals and there was certainly some strange things happening at Rosa\u2019s flat.\u00a0 The only part of the book which did spoil it for me slightly was the fact that Rosa had been left this shop, flat and money and yet there wasn\u2019t really a lot of thought as to who it might have been.\u00a0 Me, I would have wanted to know who it was before I even set a foot in it, let alone move my entire life down there.\u00a0 Thankfully, as the book moves on the story unfolds and it all becomes clear.It was a great read though, loveable and entertaining with some great comedic writing!\u00a0 The setting was perfect and the village was teeming with handsome men, which is always a bonus in a book like this!\u00a0 The front cover was beautiful and full praise to the artist as I would love this picture framed.\u00a0 It would also be so eye catching and would stand out on any bookshelf!\u00a0 My final praise has to go to Hot the Dog.\u00a0 Loveable and cute, his loyalty shows what a great dog he is.\u00a0 The story of how Rosa ends up with him is lovely and they are perfect together!\u00a0 A highly recommended read and I will definitely be looking to read more by this author!"}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68312189-lucy", "userReview": "Nicola May understands people.

That kick comes from the strong heroine we have in this story. Rosa Larkin has had plenty of knocks in life and so she\u2019s built up a tough shell around herself.

Of course, it\u2019s not going to be easy and she faces obstacles and resistance, but unexpected friendships crop up along the way and Rosa\u2019s soft centre starts to emerge from that hard shell. Rosa learns a lot about herself in this lively, uplifting story that\u2019s original, touching and totally enjoyable. The writing is wonderful and sweeps you along, much as events do Rosa. It may appear to be a quiet seaside town but there\u2019s a lot going along under the surface.
