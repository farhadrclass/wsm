He dislikes her because he knows from his friend\u2019s comments that she is shallow, manipulative and deceitful. His opinion is further confirmed when he arrives at her house and sees her obvious lack of mourning for her late husband. Certainly, the last thing he expects is for Joanna to kiss him passionately when he enters the room. Joanna uses the opportunity to pretend that Alex is her lover in order to discourage the unwanted advances of John Hagan, her late husband\u2019s cousin.Neither Joanna nor Alex is willing to admit to the attraction they feel for each other following the kiss. Alex regards Joanna as \u2018a manipulative woman who used men to her advantage\u2019 and Joanna sees Alex as \u2018just another philandering bastard\u2019 like David. This does not stop Alex attending Mrs Lottie Cummings\u2019 party that evening knowing the Joanna will there, but he and Joanna end up having a very public quarrel.Joanna receives a summons from Churchward & Churchward, David\u2019s lawyers, and is surprised to find Alex already there. It appears that David left a codicil to his will and both Joanna and Alex are shocked by its contents. David has an illegitimate daughter, Nina, and has left her to Joanna\u2019s care provided she travels to Spitsbergen to bring the child back to London. Worse is to come. Alex has been appointed joint guardian and sole trustee!Joanna is determined to travel to Spitsbergen to collect Nina and refuses Alex\u2019s request that he accompany her. However, when John Hagan breaks into her bedroom and tries to blackmail her into \u2018pleasing him\u2019, she pleads with Alex to marry her in order to gain the protection of his name and security for herself and her sister, Merryn. Alex agrees because he not only desires Joanna but she can also provide him with the heir he needs.Following the marriage, they embark on the hazardous journey to Spitsbergen during which their feelings for each other intensify but can their new found love survive when Alex is wary of any deep emotional involvement and Joanna finally reveals the way in which she has deceived Alex?Ms. Cornick has created an intense and emotional story exploring the complex relationship between Joanna and Alex. She brilliantly conveys the initial hostility between them with her scathing repartee such as Joanna\u2019s response to Alex\u2019s criticism of her way of life:\u201cYou know nothing of my way of life, Lord Grant, other than what is based on David\u2019s lies and your own arrogant assumptions!\u201d Her tone dripped disdain. \u201cIf it comes to that, you are the one who rackets about the world like a poorly aimed cannonball. You may provide materially for your family but you have no interest in engaging with them in any emotional sense\u201d.or when she tells him why she does not want him to accompany her to Spitsbergen:\u201cYou neither like me nor trust me and the journey will be uncomfortable enough without turning around and falling over your disapproval at every turn.\u201dI understand Alex\u2019s reluctance to accept that David Ware was not the honourable man he thought him to be. They had a close friendship based on their mutual love of exploring and the fact that David had saved Alex\u2019s life. There would be no reason for Alex to believe that what he had learnt about Joanna was untrue. I like the way in which Alex\u2019s preconceptions about Joanna are slowly stripped away as he discovers that she is vulnerable, caring and brave.He is slow to admit his deep feelings for Joanna because the death of his first wife, Amelia, has left him reluctant to enter into any deep relationships. His guilt over Amelia\u2019s death drives him to constantly accept dangerous assignments. It is almost as though he has a death wish.I like Joanna and feel great sympathy for her. The lifestyle she leads, although lacking any apparent substance, was originally her way of coping with the trauma of her disastrous marriage. I admire her strength in leaving David and making a life for herself. Her initial dislike of Alex is understandable given her previous experiences with her husband but, gradually, she appreciates that Alex is nothing like David. He doesn\u2019t court fame and popularity as David did and, although he is physically strong, she knows that he would never use that strength to hurt anyone. Even during the quarrels between Joanna and Alex, Ms Cornick\u2019s superb writing style allows you to sense the sexual tension simmering just underneath. I love the scene where Joanna intends to seduce Alex into marrying her, but can\u2019t go through with it. Alex turns the tables on her, saying that he won\u2019t marry her unless she seduces him. The love scene which follows is sizzling! Here\u2019s a little teaser:\u2018He picked her up and tossed her on the bed. It was so sudden and shocking that she lay there, winded for a moment. He was kneeling above her and he looked huge and powerful and shockingly masculine and she felt her heart race with a mixture of apprehension and fascination and the most wicked, wicked delight.\u2019Lottie Cummings, Joanna\u2019s closest friend, is an interesting character. On the surface, she is frivolous, immoral and selfish, but I believe that underneath this fa\u00e7ade, she is lonely and unfulfilled. I\u2019m looking forward to reading the second book in this series \u2018One Wicked Sin\u2019 which is Lottie\u2019s story. Quite how Ms Cornick is going to transform Lottie in to a true heroine I\u2019m not quite sure, but I look forward to finding out!I do hope subsidiary characters, Captain Owen Purchase and Alex\u2019s cousin, James Devlin, get their own books because they would make simply yummy heroes! What a nasty piece of work David Ware was. He\u2019s lucky that he is already dead; otherwise I would like to have seen him strung up by a certain part of his anatomy!Ms Cornick vividly conveys the stark beauty of the Arctic Circle and the dangers lurking there and the scene in which sea ice threatens to trap their ship particularly comes to mind.There\u2019s plenty of humour in the book, and here are some of my favourite quotes: \u201cIt is hoped that you can navigate your way better across the frozen wastes than you can around a woman\u2019s body, or you may end in Spain rather than Spitsbergen.\u201d \u201cI fear I would need to know you a great deal more intimately before I strip off in your ballroom or indeed any other room.\u201d\u201cI came here to seduce you\u201d, Joanna said in a rush. \u201cExcuse me, my lord,\u201d Frazer said into the silence that followed. \u201cI do not believe I should be present at a moment like this.\u201d\u201cSo in the end you\u2019ll make love with me for the sake of your wardrobe? That sounds about right.\u201d\u201cI shall now allow Mr. Devlin to shaft me with great vigour until he reveals all his secrets.\u201dI can highly recommend \u2018Whisper of Scandal\u2019 to lovers of historical romance and look forward to reading further books in this series.http://www.theromancereviews.com/view...This review was originally written for The Romance Reviews"}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27479061-wendy", "userReview": "Whisper of Scandal was the first of Nicola Cornick's books I have read. It came as a recommendation and I was not disappointed.Joanna Ware has been badly treated both physically and mentally by her, now deceased, husband. They were estranged before his death and as a result of his treatment of her, she has become rather self absorbed with outward appearances and the superficiality of the ton. David Ware was an explorer, a hero, and darling of the ton. He courted this popularity shamelessly, whored and shamed Joanna by his behaviour, leaving her to believe that she was the one lacking.She longed for a child of her own but did not conceive during her marriage and when, on his death, David Ware demanded in his will, cruelly, that she travel to the Arctic to rescue his abandoned love child, in company with his fellow explorer and friend, Alex, Lord Grant, Joanna reluctantly agrees to his escort. Her emptiness over her inability to have a child of her own driving her decision. The two are to be guardians to Nina who at present is residing in a monastery in a far flung area of the Arctic.The animosity between Joanna and Alex is strong, Alex because he believes Joanna to be shallow and uncaring over the loss of her dead husband. This opinion was fed to Alex, who admired David Ware, because he had once saved Alex's life. Ware took advantage of this admiration to poison the mind of his friend against Joanna.Joanna thought Alex Grant to be dark and grim although extremely attractive and felt his animosity very keenly from the first meeting after his return following his friends demise. The strong physical attraction between them, however, was sizzling! Ignore it they could not. Joanna refused to explain to Alex why she had no pleasant memories of her disastrous marriage and Alex preferred to cling to his opinion without any real substance, other than the vitriolic ranting of his one time friend. Alex wanted to seduce Joanna, purely because he thought her to be promiscuous and shallow and utterly irresistible Joanna lived, with her younger sister, on the charity of her husbands cousin, Hagan and her own small inheritance from a relative, and interior design commissions she received from members of the ton, as a lady known and followed for her style and talent. Hagan lusts after her and tries to force her into intimacy with him, after nearly capitulating she decides on drastic action.Ms. Cornick's research on explorers of the day and also her extensive research on travel to the arctic, including conditions endured, dangers encountered, diet etc lends excellent original credence to this story. I was slightly put off by the shallowness of Joanna's character, particularly in regard to her wardrobe and the matching 'yellow ribbon' in her border terrier, Max's top knot. Owning border terriers myself, I would find it hard to believe that these scruffy little dogs would ever have appealed to someone as fastidious in her appearance as Joanna Ware. If they did, I would have expected him to be well groomed, in which case it would be impossible to put a ribbon in his top knot.I admired the description of Alex Grant as a man of directness, integrity and honesty. I could quite see why Joanna fell for him. His own fears and ghosts simply make him more loveable and human. I did not find Lottie, Joanna's friend, credible, and would have thought that the ton, snobbish as they were, would have considered her an upstart.This was, on the whole, a well written, original love story, with minor discrepancies, (I'm probably just being picky) the slowly overcoming of dislike for each other, adding spice and interest and a need to know what happens next. I had one chapter to go and had to read it at 2am in the morning!I'm hoping the rest of this series will find happy endings for Owen and Dev as they are excellent secondary characters. I would also love to read in a later book in this series that Joanna at last has her baby.A lovely, romantic, well written book which I thoroughly recommend. If not for my few, minor niggles I would have had no hesitation in awarding 5 stars, as it is, a well deserved 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5555146-eva", "userReview": "Being here in Milan makes me finish the book \u2013 finally. That\u2019s a good thing actually because I loved it. After driving for nearly 7h to Verona and two more by Milano I needed to get some reading done before being able to fall asleep. I left Vienna with only like 100 pages left on this one so it was kind of a quick read before falling asleep finally. \u201eWhisper of Scandal\u201c is the 1st book in the \u201eScandalous women of the ton\u201c series by Nicola Cornick, and the 4th I think I read so far but of course not in the right row. I tend to do it less and less soften, I don\u2019t know why. 1811. Lady Joanna Ware, short Jo, is the oldest sister of three and was married, her husband David died on an expedition to the Arctic. He hated her and she disliked him but he preferred light skirts to her and didn\u2019t even try to hide it. And he punished her physically, and of course psychically, for not giving him an heir. So in the end she wasn\u2019t that sad that he had died. About a year after his death, Lord Alex Grant knocks on Jo\u2019s door to say how sorry he is about her husband\u2019s death but she isn\u2019t alone but her cousin is attending and so it happens that she let this cousin think that Alex and she are having a hot affair. The problem is that she didn\u2019t tell him about it before the show went on. And those navigators are the love of the ton at the moment. So her cousin really thinks that they are in love because she is kissing him rather openly in front of him. Alex didn\u2019t know that he tried to blackmail her. Alex doesn\u2019t know what to think about all of it, except for the fact that he starts to lust after her pretty quickly. A couple of days later they have both a meeting with Joanna\u2019s lawyer because Alex brought a letter from Jo\u2019s husband with him who died 18 months ago. In this letter he tells Jo that he has a daughter out of wedlock who lives in a monastery in Spitzbergen because she\u2019s now an orphan. But she has to share custody with Alex if she wants the kid. David knew that she would do everything to have a kid, even travel to Spitzbergen to pick the girl up which is in the testament. So now the negotiations start. Alex doesn\u2019t want Jo to go on a ship because a trip to Spitzbergen is to dangerous. She thinks that she can do it because she has the money just to buy herself a passage. In the end it isn\u2019t that easy and her cousin, who learns about David\u2019s testament, threatens to take everything away from if she does this journey because of scandal it would bring over the family to take care of David\u2019s bastard. So Jo has to think about herself, her younger sister that is living with her and the girl in Spitzbergen. She only sees one option \u2013 seduce Alex. To cut it a little short \u2013 she is able to go on the ship, with her friend Lottie and they travel to Spitzbergen, together with Alex and Captain Owen Purchase. What I like about the whole series is that every single book has a really different storyline, not one is the same and that rarely happens. Most of the time I get the feeling that there are similarities but not even the sisters have anything in common except for two of them who have kind of a scandalous past. Plus I liked the way Cornick described the Artic, Spitzbergen and the two women with their attempts to fit in but also to dress adequate. It\u2019s kind of funny on the one side but also drawn quite realistic on the other. And I liked Joanna and Alex a lot. I liked Joanna already in the other books where she was a side character only but her past made her the person she is and all of the girls have a past in their family who influence their present - another thing I like a about this series. So the rating is really easy: 5 stars"}, {"userName": "LaFleurBleue", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8956777-lafleurbleue", "userReview": "That was the second book from this author I read. The first one had been given to me by a friend and had not made such an impression. This one was very cheaply priced and that's the reason why I decided to give it a chance.I did not like it much. I felt that there was too much liberty taken with the historical reality. I did not care much for most of the characters. The hero had been wrong his whole life regarding the true personality of his best friend. The heroine was a vain and selfish chit. Her friend had been cheating her with her previous philandering husband, was abundantly promiscuous and a lying manipulating self-interested ever-unsatisfied person. I rolled my eyes several times over the plot, at inconsistencies or nonsense.That will be my last from this author who really does not work for me at all."}, {"userName": "Amarilli Settantatre", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12419437-amarilli-settantatre", "userReview": "Davvero godibile, a tratti divertente, a tratti venato di tenero struggimento.Lady Ware \u00e8 un'eroina dei nostri tempi.

She has a long line of possible suitors lined up even though she has no desire to remarry. Lady Ware was left with a bad taste for marriage after her former husband, Lord David Ware, created quite the reputation for himself as a womanizer. When Lord Ware died, he left his estate to his only remaining relative, John Hagan. John Hagan is a middle aged man and has kindly agreed to let Lady Joanna remain in the home that she shared with her husband, but it doesn\u2019t come without a price. John Hagan is one of the many suitors lined up asking for her hand in marriage, proposing to her countless times. During one of his proposals, Lord Alex Grant interrupts him, coming to pay his respects to Lady Joanna regarding the death of her husband. Lady Ware sees Lord Grant as a potential life-saver and engages in a passionate kiss with him right in front of Lord Hagan. What she doesn\u2019t expect is the way she responds to the scandalous kiss with Alex.Like Lady Ware\u2019s husband, Lord Grant is a sailor; an adventurer. He sailed many an adventure with Lord Ware and looks at him as a true naval hero. During his time with Lord Ware, he\u2019d heard him mention his wife in nothing but disrespect, depicting her as a cold, manipulative, heartless woman. Lord Grant doesn\u2019t expect to see such a beauty of a woman, and immediately, he desires her in ways he hasn\u2019t felt since his wife tragically died several years ago. After engaging in such a public passionate kiss, Lord Grant finds himself quite the talk of the ton.As if their kiss wasn\u2019t enough scandal for Lord Grant and Lady Ware, the two of them soon discover that Lord Ware has left them both guardianship of his bastard child, Nina, who is in a monastery in the North Pole. The two of them must depart on a sea voyage to obtain her. While Lord Grant is confused as to why he would be named guardian to this child, Lady Ware is elated at the idea of possibly having a child of her own. While married to Lord Ware, she was unable to become pregnant and after a particularly brutal beating at the hand of David Ware, Joanna is convinced that she is now completely barren. Even though Nina is not her flesh and blood, she recognizes that this very well may be her only chance to have a child.Soon, word gets out regarding the quest that Lord Grant and Lady Ware are about to embark on. A lady travelling in itself is scandalous, but the fact that it\u2019s to retrieve a child that is not even the Lady\u2019s own is quite the talk. It doesn\u2019t take long for John Hagan to find out Joanna\u2019s plans and he threatens to take everything away from Lady Ware should she embark on this journey. Not only would that mean that she would have to give up her home and her stylish way of living, but it would also mean that her sister, Merryn, would be without a home as well. Desperate to maintain her lavish lifestyle and a home from a good name for her sister and Nina, Joanna suggests marriage to none other than Lord Alex Grant. Lord Grant is convinced that she only seeks his last name to remain at the top of the ton, but he cannot deny that he is immensely attracted to her. He agrees to marry Lady Joanna with the promise that she will give him an heir to leave his estate to should something happen to him. Lady Joanna, already beginning to feel more that a little attraction for Alex, regretfully does not tell him that she fears she is barren. She agrees to this marriage of convenience without divulging this important information to Lord Grant. A marriage of convenience it may be, but Lord Grant is determined to have Lady Joanna spend as much time as possible with him, especially in his bed.This was a first read for me by this author, and I very much enjoyed this story. The h/h started out hating one another quite a bit, and the sarcastic banter between the two of them was great! What made it especially delicious, was how intense the sexual tension was between the two of them. This is full of adventure of every kind. Suspense, backstabbing, treasure hunting, overcoming weather challenges, etc. It was especially entertaining to see the ladies of the ton in less than stellar accommodations aboard the ship when they set out to retrieve Nina.A whole host of characters are introduced in this novel that set up for several more books in this series, three of which are already completed. James Devlin is the delicious rake that is cousin to Lord Grant. Lottie Cummings is the annoying yet loveable friend of Joanna, who also likes to make her way around the young men. And, my personal favorite, Owen Purchase, a southern American with a sexy drawl and quite a gentleman. Overall, I really enjoyed this and look forward to the remainder of the series. The only complaint I would have is that I would\u2019ve liked it to have been a little bit steamier, but other than that, a solid first author read for me!!

I like a lot of Nicola Cornick's writing. The characters are well drawn, the pacing good, the dialogue witty, the chemistry well done... but this book featured a trope I'm coming to LOATHE. The 'terrible misunderstanding' trope. Hero thinks heroine is shallow/vapid/sluttish/awful in some way, despite having no real reason to. He begins to suspect that he may be wrong and then - boom - at the slightest provocation decides that no, actually, she really is shallow/vapid/sluttish/awful after all and dumps her.Until ANOTHER BLOKE comes along and tells him he's wrong and the heroine is actually lovely, whereupon he changes his mind. Cue blissful reunion.This ruined the book for me. Romance authors, PLEASE stop this. How can we trust a hero who doesn't have any faith in his own judgement and who is determined to think the worst of the woman he supposedly loves? This isn't romance. I wouldn't put up with this shoddy treatment in real life and I don't want to read about anyone else doing it. There were plenty of opportunities for Alex to find out the truth from Joanna, plenty of times when she would have trusted him with the truth. It would have been far more satisfying if he'd said 'Tell me your side, then' and she'd trusted him enough to do it. Sure, you wouldn't have had the 'crisis point' in the relationship (which was paper thin anyway and undermined him as a worthy hero) but the relationship between them would have been better and so would the book."}, {"userName": "Funmbi ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7276292-funmbi", "userReview": "I am officially obsessed with Nicola Cornick! This series is amazing...once I start reading, I can never stop. Cornick's writing and characters pull me in so totally that, truly, from the first chapter, it's impossible to put it down. I'm actually working backwards, having first read book 6 of this series. But Whisper of Scandal is every bit as exciting! Adventure, romance, betrayal, heartbreak, forgiveness...this a wonderfully quick and juicy read, which I give 4.5 stars. Joanna Ware is the widow of Lord David Ware, an explorer who dies in the Arctic. Unfortunately, Joanna and David's relationship was plagued with infidelity and, at its lowest point, physical abuse. After Lord Ware's death, his best friend, Lord Alex Grant arrives in London to deliver an addendum to David's will. In addition to cutting Joanna off from his estate, David has made Joanna the guardian of his illegitimate daughter, who he's abandoned in an Arctic monastery. Despite the scandal she would incur, Joanna aims to travel to the Arctic in order to claim this daughter. And though Lord Grant thinks very poorly of Joanna (believing David's criticisms and angry claims), he's still incredibly attracted to her and determined to help Joanna. I love Joanna! She has such dignity and grace. It's true that Joanna loves society, but at the same time, she hides behind her vanity. Joanna uses it to cloak her vulnerability. Joanna cares for her family and is willing to sacrifice herself and her happiness from them. Alex Grant is so dashing, charming, loyal, yet reserved. He loves being an explorer and, since losing his wife, Alex is determined to stay away from London and continue his adventure. Unfortunately, Alex is so loyal that he believes David's bad-mouthing about Joanna. Yet, after meeting her, Alex can't help but question the reasons for David's poor opinion. There's such Insane attraction between Joanna and Alex, right from the beginning. They have several wonderful tet a tets: one minute Joanna and Alex are arguing, the next they're kissing! J: \"It is unaccounted, is it not, for I do not like you at all.\" A: \"And yet... And yet you want me.\" *SHIVERS* They totally want each other, and it's interesting how Alex pursues Joanna quite vehemently. He wants them to be lovers, but she tries to avoid him, not wanting to become embroiled with another adventurer. But, as a result of David's will, Joanna and Alex are bound together via this orphaned daughter. But as they get to know each other--Alex seeing the kind, loving woman behind Joanna's facade, Joanna seeing Alex's gentleness and integrity--their hot attraction starts to grow into something more.A few favorite moments:-Lottie and Devlin and the ice sword...MERCY! (You have to read it...whoa!)-Joanna and Alex bonding over the Arctic beauty and travel.-Alex observes Joanna's London Society persona vs her true nature...-When Joanna beats Alex at chess...several times!-THE HOT HOT HOT SEXY TIMES! For example:\"You are my wife and I want you and if you had not been sick for the whole voyage, I would have been in your bed for the entire time. That is how one passes ones time on a ship and playing chess be dammed.\" *FANS FACE*ORThe bridal bath!-When Alex goes after Joanna like a pirate! *SWOON*This story is so exciting! There's a surprising amount of action in the plot, constantly keeping me on my toes. And by the end, I'm cheering for Joanna and Alex and their happily ever after! I really hope we get to see more of these two in the upcoming books!I'm excited to keep reading, especially since the next book is about Lottie. She is so despicable to Joanna, so it'll be interesting to see how Cornick redeems her.I totally recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Carolyn  Storer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2449271-carolyn-storer", "userReview": "\"Whisper of Scandal\" is a meaty historical romance, with great plot and well defined characters. I liked the heroine straight away. Widowed Lady Joanna Ware is a complex character, as is the hero, but she is immensely likeable, whereas Lord Alex Grant is not. It took me quite some time to warm to him due to his arrogent, presumptuous and incredibly shallow manner, where he dislikes Joanna without knowing her and only goes on one person's opinion.From the first chapter, when Lady Joanna and Lord Alex meet and Joanna kisses him in the hope to disuade her dead husband's cousin from his advances, I thought this was going to be a fairly light historical romance, but it wasn't.Joanna's husband, an adventurer, dies while abroad and we are given glimpses into this horrid little man's life and his treatment of Joanna as we read further into the novel, which helped me understand her and how much she has been through. So when Lord Alex Grant is nasty to her, all I want to do is box his ears! But luckily, Joanna is an intelligent and articulate woman and gives as good as she gets. At times, Joanna puts Alex in his place so much so, I wanted to fist pump the air and cry \"Yes! Take that, you cad!\"Although I didn't particularly like Alex for most of the book, he did begin to grow on me when he joined Joanna on a trip to the Arctic to bring home an orphaned child, and by the end of the novel, I loved him nearly as much as she did!The secondary characters are also full of life, I specially liked Purchase, the captain of the boat Joanna charters for the long voyage. He's so protective and so in love with Joanna he will do anything to protect her.The only secondary character I didn't like was Lottie Cummings - what a horrid woman. She proclaims to be Joanna's best friend and yet had an affair with her husband, she's incredibly grating and very shallow. She doesn't grow or change a bit throughout the entire novel and then she betrays Joanna again. Why Joanna continues to be friends with her I don't quite understand.The dialogue between all the characters is well written and sharp, especially between Joanna and Alex. I really felt their dislike of each other, even though they simultaneously want to rip each other's clothes off. Venom drips from their words which are, at times, hurtful and spiteful, and it was immensely enjoyable to read. The only thing I will say is this did go on for a bit too long in my opinion and became a touch frustrating.However, overall the pacing is very good and I believed Joanna and Alex's growing love. It isn't too abrupt, everything happens at the right time, and Alex soon comes to his senses. The sex scenes are sensual rather than explicit and the romance builds wonderfully.The ending is just swoon-worthy, and so romantic - I won't give anything away, but let me just say, I now want to go on a long boat voyage to the Arctic and be swept off my feet by a Lord...VERDICT:A lovely historical romance with all the right ingredients. If you enjoy the love/hate relationship - and I do, it's my favourite kind - then you will gobble this up.

It has taken her twelve months to get used to the death of her husband, explorer Lord David Ware. And during that year she has lived on borrowed time, in a house that is no longer hers, and an uncertain future. When Lord Alex Grant returns from the Arctic with a missive from her husband\u2019s deathbed, it can only spell more trouble for Joanna. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. When she has been delivered the news that her profligate husband has left his illegitimate child at the monastery of Bellsund, and named both Alex and Joanna as guardians, then its gets much, much, worse. Lord Grant despises Joanna despite his searing attraction to her, and has been turned completely against her by the things that he has heard from her late husband. Joanna realizes that she cannot fight his prejudice. But somehow they must come to an accord, to make it to Spitsbergen and fulfill the terms of Lord David\u2019s will. What follows is a bracing adventure into wilds of the Arctic Circle, as their unlikely entourage encounters bears, inescapable sea ice, island natives, and each other. Somehow, somewhere, things start to thaw between Alex and Joanna, and she must entrust her secret, and her heart, yet once again. Nicola Cornick is by no means a cookie-cutter historical romance novelist. Rather, her characters are earthy, tangibly real, and not always cut from a pristine cloth. In fact, Cornick\u2019s characters dwell both the in the haute ton, and the lowliest slums and rookeries of London. It is that diversity, that allows Cornick to push the envelope of her characters and flesh out compelling stories that have not been told a dozen times before. Her historicals are sprinkled with unapologetic fortune hunters, disgraced courtesans, and pure debutantes that willingly embroil themselves in a scandalous quest for sensuality. Whisper of Scandal is such a story, spilling with excitement, scandalous scenes, and a stirring romance that pulls the reader willingly along on an adventurous journey. The sensual attraction between Alex and Joanna honestly could melt the polar ice cap. It was breathtakingly original AND without a doubt, the scene between James Devlin and Lottie Cummings just about made me blush! Scorching. Naughty. We definitely need a book about dashing Devlin!I was absolutely compelled to also devour Cornick\u2019s Lord of Scandal, and Secrets of a Courtesan directly after reading Whispers of Scandal.

I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. The writing is really quite beautiful. There were some excellent terms and a lot of really vivid description. I loved the characters. I thought both Joanna and Alex had real depth. It was riveting the way their layers were pealed back to reveal all their imperfections. It was lovely how in the end they found each other. I'm a sucker for this sort of thing but I loved how the main two characters chaffed against one another but then realised that was attraction.

I find myself intrigued with her character and plot choices. I never know what to expect next with her selections. In Whisper of Scandal, Cornick starts her setting with Regency London and then sweeps the reader away on a journey by ship to Spitsbergen at the North Pole. Her descriptions of this harsh and cold climate left me filled with interest over the culture and lifestyle of those raised in such a remote landscape. This is one of my favorite parts of the book\u2014reading about adventure and exploration of the unknown! Lady Joanna and Lord Grant are well constructed characters. I liked their personalities and thought they complemented each other well. They are both strong figures, each one making their way out of their own private hell. There is a special sensitivity that they show to one another when the need arises, which makes them all the more likable for me. The hard part is just getting past the fa\u00e7ade that they wear. Really, these two are very much peas in a pod. The only difficult part for me in the book was Alex\u2019s relationship with Joanna\u2019s deceased husband. It was troublesome to understand his hero-worship for such a nasty character\u2026I think I wanted more of a back-story between the two men to comprehend it fully. It would have been nice to see it developed even more thoroughly.Finally, there\u2019s a particular point of the book where the purpose is to rescue an orphaned child left behind in the barren land of the North Pole. I applaud this plot point thoroughly and have to say that I am extremely pleased with how Cornick wrote its conclusion. I thought it very clever and sensitive. Really, really loved that bit. A note to remember: This is the first of a trilogy. I\u2019ve also read the second book (my thoughts on that are coming soon) and am very much looking forward to the final installment\u2014which coincidentally provides the tie between the three books. I love that we have already met the hero & heroine by the time we get there. A couple that I would not have thought to match\u2014this I have to admit! This book is a great fit for Regency lovers who love beautiful settings and love with a bit of tragedy thrown in."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1597979-dawn", "userReview": "Lady Joanna Ware is the widow of Lord David Ware and she has decided she would never marry again. Not because of a great love affair but because of her unhappy marriage, even before his death she had been estranged from David for five years. Yet she is still the darling of the Ton whom everyone adores as she adores them, at least that is until she meets Lord Alexander Grant. Grant was her errant husband\u2019s best friend and is disturbed by Joanna. David had tainted Joanna\u2019s reputation by speaking ill of her not to mention Grant hates the Ton, the very society that Joanne has embraced. From the first moment they meet Alex & Joanna disagree and are often unable to be civil towards each other, but David has thrown them a curve ball from beyond the grave. David has fathered a child and abandoned her somewhere near the North Pole; he had complicated matters by naming them both guardians. If you are looking for a really great historical romance novel this is it. The book does not take place in one location, the first half of the book is in London and the second half is at sea as they travel to the North Pole. I really loved this couple, Joanna is a strong woman but she has been dealt a lot of blows and she has tremendous courage. David was a well known philanderer and was known to engage in frequent affairs outside of their marital bed, the list seemed quite long and even included her best friend Lottie. Not to mention if Joanna was to raise the orphaned child she could easily loose her social status. I liked how she handled matters always attempting to hold her head high and she remained quite calm and sweet. Grant is also an intriguing hero, he is very loyal and stubborn, I found it interesting to watch him come to terms with all of who David was. At the onset Grant think Joanna frivolous, yet despite all his friends allegations, Grant had trouble reconciling what he saw in Joanna vs. what he thought he knew. The setting on sea was perfect and gave a glimpse into what life for an expedition must be like. The writing really gives the book life, I easily believed these two were falling in love with each other even if they had intended otherwise. All and all a very pleasurable read, and was quite sad it ended."}, {"userName": "Jynt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5812701-jynt", "userReview": "Somehow, when I saw that there would be adventure....I didn't expect to be the-mostly-smooth-sailing-adventure-of-Joanna-and-crew. Sure, Joanna got seasick. Sure, there was sex. Sure, there was the heart stoppingly tense moment where the ship got stuck in ice and Alex had to (oh horror) go down, cut a path and possibly drown. In fact, that moment was so tense, I don't believe I even know how he achieved it, save for the fact that Joanna was terrified (?) and then she was not. And hip hip hooray, Norway (?) here we are! Monastery? Gotcha. Child? Yeap, there you are. That's it. That's the adventure! My problem with this book is that I was given to expect adventure. And half of it was spent playing the good ol' hate/lust game. The journey itself was remarkably unremarkable. The companions were... there. The conflict was flimsy. Why did nobody inform Alex that David was an abusive asshole? Just loads of cryptic stares and silences. Purchase was quite interesting but I'd really love to know how he fell in love with Joanna. Was it... her behavior? Looks? Abusive (dead) ex-husband? How did he even meet her? Since I'm asking questions, here are a few more: How did David save Alex's life? What happened to Alex's limp? Did he have a limp? Did I dream it up? Because I swear, one moment Alex had a limp, and the next moment Alex could go around cutting ice and bouncing around with no limp in sight. (No seriously, maybe I mistook one misinformed hero for another.) I don't remember things well. I can't remember names of characters whom I truly enjoyed reading about. I have problems remembering what I ate two days ago. So maybe all my queries/problems are just a byproduct of my amazingly shitty memory. That's not to say my brain doesn't have the capacity to generate general impressions. And the general impression of this book is that it was inconsistent and vague. Here's a surprise:I enjoyed the book. Sure, the entire conflict just revolved around one huge secret. Sure, it's possibly the vaguest adventure(?) historical romance I've read. For all its flaws, Joanna and Alex's relationship was interesting enough, and the writing was not that bad.

Truly a great story with great characters and definitely great flirtations of steamy scenes and words! However, with a slight tingle of hope toward the end--ending with a small disappointed--nonetheless content with its ending earned it a 4.75 STARS from me. Reason, below.SPOILERI enjoyed the first part of the story quite well. Especially since Alex is such a sexy man already and his daring words and seductive senses makes the book all the better. Same for Joanna whom I ratherly reminded me of my own sister (her terms of her own perfection, clothing, and desires of fashion and etc). She is a very interesting character and I like her very much. Her interactions with Alex brings joys to me as I enjoyed their ice and fire relationship.However, toward the second part. I really had a tense of hope that Cornick would make Joanna pregnant with Alex`s heir since the possible of her seasickness lasting for such a long time and the possible changes within opening her character more toward Alex--a possible result of her pregency. As well as when she had confessed that she won`t be able to bear Alex a heir and left him boarding the Raison. I wanted Alex to feel more lost and miserable before finding Joanna. I wanted him to taste another failure and destruction before he realized how much Joanna met to him. A slight dark thought of me wanted him NOT to find Joanna so fast but (if she was pregnant) to chase her back to London in hearing the news that she is pregnant with his child. And possibly, have to convinced her that he wants not only the child but her. But of course, none of this happened.THOUGH, I am happy to say. I am quite content with how the story progressed and ended. I did wished for an epilogue and possibly some answers toward Joanna and Alex`s possible future family.

The characters are enchanting, interesting, believable, handsome, adventurous, and determined.

The she in question is Lady Joanna Ware; the he, her deceased husband, Lord David Ware, Alexander's best friend. Alex believes everything David ever said about his marriage and almost nothing Joanna says in defense or rebuttal. So Joanna leaves him to his incorrect and biased opinions. She's content to never see him again until David manages to toss them together via a guardianship for his illegitimate daughter. Only then does Alex begin to see David -- and Joanna -- in a new light.Desperate for a child, even an illegitimate one, Joanna spares no expense in seeking to retrieve the girl from her homeland. Joanna's progress is hampered, naturally, by Alex, who believes she's not fit to take such a voyage on her own. Following a run-in with her late husband's heir, Joanna proposes she and Alex marry, an action that would help both of them equally (she would be given the protection of Alex's name, and he could count on her to provide an adequate home environment for his underage cousin, Chessie, and perhaps an heir). When they do marry, I immediately thought of Alex's earlier statement to his cousin Devlin:I would make the devil of a husband.I knew then that Alex and Joanna would find their way into one another's hearts. The truths that confront them on their journey to the North Pole do test their new marriage and their unconfessed love, and their respective paths toward this love, particularly Joanna's, are so heartbreaking.

I started this book and didn't want to put it down. I thought about it when I had to put it down. I loved it. The main characters were engaging. I even liked Alex, with his arrogance and ignorant determination to believe in his \"friend's\" honesty, thus believing Joanna to be a manipulative harpy. I thought it made him realistic. At moments it was irritating, but like I said, realistic.My favorite part of this was the unusual setting. The Arctic in a Regency romance? That's awesome! It was fascinating and reminded me why I enjoyed Madeleine Brent titles so much, the exotic locales. My only beef was how long it took them to get there. Halfway through the book I was beginning to wonder if they'd ever go. There are sex scenes, but they are skippable (if you're the skipping type) and the story stands on its own without them. At least, I think it does.I will be reading the next in the series, One Wicked Sin, even though I didn't like Lottie in Whisper of Scandal.
