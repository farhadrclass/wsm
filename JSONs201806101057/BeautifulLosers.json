Una battuta ricorrente \u00e8 dire a un altro che sta facendo due film insieme: il primo e ultimo. Gran bell\u2019incoraggiamento.Il parallelo nasce dal fatto che alcuni critici classificano questo come il secondo romanzo di Cohen, altri invece come l\u2019ultimo.Leonard Cohen scrisse due romanzi, questo \u00e8 il secondo. E in effetti, dopo non ce ne sono stati altri.Li scrisse pi\u00f9 di cinquanta anni fa \u2013 questo \u00e8 del 1966, se non sbaglio. Dopo ci sono state splendide poesie in forma di canzoni. E pochi poeti hanno scritto musica bella e immortale come la sua.I belli e perdenti (beatiful losers) di questo romanzo sono prima di tutto A., il protagonista io narrante, innamorato di sua moglie Edith, e innamorato di F., amico amante modello, e anche amante della defunta Edith. A. studia gli irochesi, una ragazza irochese in particolare, Catherine: forse \u00e8 innamorato anche di lei, che \u00e8 vissuta tre secoli prima di lui, e questo sembrerebbe renderlo perdente in partenza.A sconfiggerlo definitivamente c\u2019\u00e8 la morte della moglie, suicida nel pozzo dell\u2019ascensore.Se poi ci fosse ancora qualche dubbio sulla sconfitta di A., aggiungerei che la Catherine irochese che tanto lo assorbe, Catherine Tekakwitha per la precisione, si convert\u00ec al cristianesimo, fece voto di castit\u00e0, si lasci\u00f2 morire di stenti, privazioni e penitenze (era solita adornarsi il girovita con una fascia di cuoio decorata all\u2019interno con chiodi che si stringeva causando quello che \u00e8 facile immaginare), in un delirio mistico e fu la prima santa vergine di quel popolo.Lou Reed \u00e8 stato un grande fan di questo libro.In un\u2019intervista Leonard Cohen ha raccontato di aver scritto questo romanzo nel giardino di una casetta dell\u2019isola di Hydra nel Mar Egeo, tra rocce e fiori di campo, e lo ha definito il frutto di un colpo di sole.In una lettera al suo editore invece scrisse che \u201dBeautiful Losers\u201d \u00e8 una storia d'amore, un salmo, una messa nera, un monumento, una satira, una preghiera, un grido, la mappa di una strada attraverso luoghi selvaggi, uno scherzo, un affronto di cattivo gusto, un'allucinazione, una noia, un irrilevante sfoggio di virtuosismo malato, un trattato gesuitico, una stravaganza escatologica. In breve: una sgradevole epica religiosa di incomparabile bellezza.All\u2019epoca mi piacque, ne apprezzai lo sperimentalismo (\u00e8 un incantesimo, un rituale sciamanico, una messa, un sabba), l\u2019uscire fuori dai binari, il non avere una vera e propria trama ma seguire illuminazioni e flusso di coscienza, l\u2019essere visionario psichedelico e pieno di immagini come la musica che mi piaceva e che mi piace, che ascoltavo in quel periodo, e che ascolto ancora. Ma sono contento che Cohen si sia dedicato alla musica: forse abbiamo perso un grande scrittore, ma \u00e8 certo che abbiamo guadagnato un immenso musicista.Hydra, l\u2019isola del mar Egeo, dove Cohen scrisse il romanzo.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH1XT...THE FUTUREhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkSER...FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAThttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7vbH...SEEM SO LONG AGO, NANCY"}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "\"I don't need a reasonFor what I becameI've got these excusesThey're tired and lameI don't need a pardon, no, no, no, no, noThere's no one left to blameI'm leaving the tableI'm out of the gameI'm leaving the tableI'm out of the game\"Leonard Cohen's last song.

Having not the money for hiring a babysitter and being myself more or less the same age of her schoolkids I was joining her on Saturdays, when my school was closed. At that time -1987- most of the Italian radio stations were hard to catch on the mountains we were heading to. Still, the Fiat Uno of my parents could easily cope with that problem having a -drum roll- tape recorder.The only problem was that the one and only tape we had in the car, for reasons I would not investigate, was \"The Best of Leonard Cohen\".The road was all curves and harpin bends crowded of trucks carrying gravel between Florence and Bologna, my hometown. It was early in the morning. I wanted to stay in bed. My mum insisted for making me drink milk for breakfast. As a result of these factors: I suffered from car sickness. And my mum was listening to The Best of Leonard Cohen.How much I couldn't stand that tape? It's hard to tell without anger. All the songs gave me nausea and migraine, but particularly \"Hallelujah\", \"Hey that's no way to say goodbye\" and \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" (it's four in the morning, the end of december...) were the equivalent of a water torture standing with my head upside down. I think I puked a couple of times. Not that I felt guilty for that.Anyways. It took me exactly 15 years to win over my hate for Cohen (meanwhile my parents went to see him live twice and bought a pile of his CDs), but now I can say the fellow became one of my favourite listenings. Maybe I'm just getting old, who knows?And yet, until now I did not have the chance of reading anything of what he wrote neither poetry nor fiction. This \"Beautiful Losers\" is my first paper Cohen.And I must say it is not giving me migraine so far. On the contrary, I am enjoying this book pretty much. Who would have said that the Quebecer minstrel was so obsessed by oral sex and Iroquois Indians? The lyrics of \"Chelsea Hotel no.2\" should have let me guess the first topic, though. It's time to be fair: \"Beautiful Losers\" is a worth reading and its author knows how to be romantic and not trivial even while passing from Kant (Immanuel, the German philosopher) to cunt (the vulgarism for the female genitalia). Believe me: ol'Leonard does it here.Quoting three lines of the song \"The Partisan\" by the same Cohen, I could summarize the plot as it follows:\"There were three of us this morning, I'm the only one this evening, but I must go on\"."}, {"userName": "Curtis Westman", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2284699-curtis-westman", "userReview": "Decadently filthy, obtuse and unrelenting, Beautiful Losers is characteristically unlike the Leonard Cohen of the early 1960s. Rather than the rhythmic, dulcet poetry and lyrics, the novel is of dense prose that more resembles the beat poetry of Kesey or Ginsberg, encapsulating the loose spirit and free living of the era in which it was written, having been first published in 1966.Beautiful Losers captures two distinct historical periods and myriad tensions that threaten to tear them apart. In the first, the narrative frame of the novel, Cohen explores the relationship between three friends and lovers: the unnamed narrator, his oldest friend, F., and his wife Edith. In the second, a story-within-a-story that becomes the obsession of the three friends, he relates the historical background of the French Jesuit occupation of the Iroquois land in the mid-1600s.Each of these periods is experiencing a great upheaval, a cultural change beset on two sides by devout opponents. The three lovers exist in a world where Montr\u00e9al is civilly torn between the Anglophones and the Francophones, the English and the French, the Queen and the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Three hundred years in the past, a Mohawk girl named Kateri Tekakwitha is struggling between the heritage of her native Iroquois and the incoming Jesuits.Both stories are paralleled by the manner in which the characters deal with the change -- through mutually assured self-destruction. Edith and F. descend further and further into a hypersexual relationship in which taboo becomes old-hat and every limit is tested. In a way, F.'s manipulation of Edith into this world of hedonism is what will eventually cause both her suicide and his death, syphilitic, in an institution for the criminally insane. The unnamed narrator, left alone without his two friends, the pillars upon which he leaned, is drawn into an obsession with Kateri, so-called the first Virgin Indian. His obsession with her virtue, however, is not in attaining it, but in defiling it, urged, as F. put it, to \"fuck a Saint\" just for the experience. Kateri, herself, toys with self-destruction in her own idyllic way, learning the self-flagellating nature of the Jesuits and, after being baptised, exaggerating it until she ends her own life in the name of God.The novel is like an impossible puzzle at times, daring the reader to unravel its knotted subtext but offering no clues as to where to begin. This, itself, is a chaotic representation of the characters lost in their own desire for anarchy. Cohen's novel is post-modern fiction at its most experimental, frequently resembling what can only be described as a Pollock in words, layer upon layer of wordplay and phoneme manipulation. Brutally satirical and eerily prophetical -- at one point, in the name of a Sovereign Qu\u00e9bec, F. blows up the statue of Queen Victoria in Victoria Square, Montr\u00e9al in an act strangely foreshadowing the FLQ bombings that occurred half a decade after the novel was written -- Beautiful Losers captures the spirit of being caught between two worlds, often slipping seamlessly between English and French and between French and Iroquois. Cohen's novel blends both humour and bitter commentary that, even to a modern reader, never gets stale or loses its playful charm."}, {"userName": "Sophia Park", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/616692-sophia-park", "userReview": "There are times when you rate a book one star because they make no sense in how they handle their themes, or a cohesive story, in a responsible, interesting way.There are times when you rate a book one star because it didn't click with you, but you can respect other people for liking it.There are times -- okay I have to stop here, because I'll just quote my philosophy teacher instead. \"Cohen's laughing at you when you read, this, man!

But I don't feel like I'm collecting a huge sketch of each person, or understand what they are as symbols. The closest thing I picked up was that F. might just be the narrator's spiritual, sexual side, that died after Edith did. That's about it. I don't know why they speed down a highway jerking off. Or why I get a list of things he put in Edith's navel or how every part of my body is erotogenic in some way or why the narrator 'has to fuck a saint' or even what that means.So I put it down.

Humans are at their core all animalistic. It is society which shapes us, lacquers us, and tells us to hide those natures like a dirty little secret. This book is completely unapologetically sensual. Completely uninhibited which, amusingly, is probably why I like it so much. There is way too many microscopic sexual definitions out there. Why is it that we, as humans, have this asinine need to categorize sexuality? Why do we have to be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc., etc., why can't we just refer to ourselves as sexual beings and move the fuck along?! Classification of sex or sexuality is such a ridiculous thing. I have never been so fascinated with the sensuality and eroticism of a book before, it hasn't happened. Now, I will say that I have also never been sexuality attracted to a 13-year-old girl nor have I had any cravings for many of the desires and cravings thought, and acted upon, in this book. That being said, the coveting of innocence is a historical absolute. There are so many examples of it in our written history that I will not even begin to list them here. Personally, I have never experienced this particular desire, nor do I necessarily agree with it, but it is in fact the most highly paid for commodity of humanity's history. Dowries, diamond rings, etc. I think, oft times that people forget the basis of desire itself, it is by definition illogical. Desires, urges, cravings, these things are not propagated by intellect. They are the animal within us. As a 13 year-old I was much more interested in catching frogs or playing on the monkey bars than sex or my own sexuality. I was still trying to figure out why kissing was such a good idea when all it seemed to me was an awkward slimy mess, but I digress. I enjoyed the way sensuality was written as a bodily experience not merely as an organ experience. This happens too frequently in today's society, we forget that eroticism is about more than coming or achieving orgasm (by the way, I think that term is completely stupid, I have no idea why I'm using it here. Here's your ribbon, sir, you achieved orgasm!) that it is an entire body's sensual form. In this way an ankle or wrist can be a very sensual thing. I realize now I have yammered on at length about sexuality and sensuality when truthfully it really isn't all the book is about. It is about being uninhibited, experiencing life and the living of it. It is spiritual and sexual and at times rather harshly disturbing. This isn't the great American novel, I don't even fully understand why I loved it like I did. Perhaps, because it is like a bird with a broken wing: not more lovely than the other birds but no less astonishing for it's brokenness. It's raw, it's unchartered, it's messy, it's insane and it's beautiful. Random thoughts, I warned you. Future readers note: If the idea of uninhibited sexuality, vulgar urges or animalistic desires disturbs you on any level, this is NOT the book for you."}, {"userName": "Haven Fairfield", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2914766-haven-fairfield", "userReview": "Everything is sacred. Nothing is profane. It is a new age concept born out in the sixties and stained with all of that decade's excesses including sex and drugs. Beautiful Losers was published in 1966. The book jacket tells me this book is about a love triangle lived out in a hell that is an apartment in Montreal. I am not sure that is true. If this is hell, it is not Dante's hell. It is not Sartre's hell. It is a disjointed, incomplete and unfinished hell. The Catholic Saint Kateri Tekakawitha serves as a fourth love interest and enunciation of the characters' identities and nationalism. She anchors the revolution that the characters fail to deliver. Edith is the female love interest. F is an aging Quebecois nationalist. The protagonist is a broken Canadian historian studying the plight of his country's indigenous nations. The four characters share and serve every possible permutation of sexual relationship. Eroticism figures greatly in this book. Experimentation in live theater is fair. The audience signed up for the abuse. Literary experiments are inherently unfair because the reader probably did not know what they were in for when they picked up the book. On the other hand, the literary experiment is more courageous than the experiment executed in live performance. The author who experiments wildly risks losing his audience for all of eternity. The live performer who experiments only needs to survive the day. Beautiful Losers is at times, expansive and at other times, indulgent and at still other times, abusive to the reader. This is not a book for the ages. It is a book of an age. Today's age of consumerism is not yesterday's age of revolution. We expect our money's worth today and are too cynical to indulge the whims of the artist. I will not recommend you haul out the bifocals of historical context to read this book. I refuse to sentence Leonard Cohen to the boneyard of sentiment. He has too much to offer for that. The good (great); \"I do not think that a saint dissolves the chaos even for himself, for there is something arrogant and warlike in the notion of a man setting the universe in order. He rides the drifts like an escaped ski. His course is a caress of the hill. His track is a drawing of the snow in a moment of its particular arrangement with wind and rock.\" The bad; \"Some believe the wart will clear up. Some are of the opinion that the wart will vanish with time. Some are reluctant to consider the wart at all. There are even those who deny the existence of warts.\"The ugly; \"Edith Edith Edith long things forever Edith stretch on E E E octopus complexion purse Edith lips lips area thy panties Edith Edith Edith Edith Edith knew you your wet rivulets Eeeeeddddddiiiiittthhh yug yug sniffle truffle deep bulb bud button sweet soup pea split rub blood rubber knob girl come head bub bup one bloom pug pig yum one tip tongue...\"(it keeps going for another estimated three hundred word-sounds). Beautiful Losers is no longer relevant. It is, at best, a tertiary influence on today's best literature. I cannot recommend it unless you are as curious as me about the song writer Leonard Cohen. Even then, you will get no closer to his genius after completing this book."}, {"userName": "Debs", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1098143-debs", "userReview": "I don't know what the hell to say about this book.

At one point I declared that it was the best book in all the world because it just felt...so good. I'll try to break it down. This was by far the strangest and most uninhibited thing that I have ever read. I felt as though I had never read a book before. Cohen wrote it when he was severely, severely depressed. Severely depressed. And I'll say it again. He was severely depressed. There's no point in trying to understand the ins and outs of the whole thing, because I just don't think you're supposed to. I'll copy-paste what it says on the back anyway...\"One of the best-known experimental novels of the 1960s, Beautiful Losers is Cohen's most defiant and uninhibited work. The novel centres upon the hapless members of a love triangle united by their sexual obsessions and by their fascination with Catherine Tekakwitha, the 17th-century Mohawk saint.By turns vulgar, rhapsodic, and viciously witty, Beautiful Losers explores each character's attainment of a state of self-abandonment, in which the sensualist cannot be distinguished from the saint.\" I don't usually talk books over with my mom, but I did this time, after I told her it was the best book ever, and she believes it's a love-hate. There's pretty much no in between. For her it was more of a hate, she is glad she read it but she has no desire to ever again. For me it was a love.

Result of not wearing a hat in the hot Mediterranean sun? Masturbation fantasy of beatitude? Hippy dipshit revolutionary nonsense failing to revolutionize? Jews for Jesus dream of Heaven?Jesus, Mary, and Joseph indeed! Is it ok if I read this to my liking Mr. Cohen? Thought so. Let's make a virgin of this slut.This is a biblical porno starring Jesus, Mary, and Joseph in which all sexual and political and spiritual energies are conspiring to canonize the Blessed Catherine Tekakwitha, to elevate the feminine in a legendary retelling of the Assumption of Mary and of all tortured brides. It begins (beyond the confines of the book) in unity in the tripartite interior of the narrator in an implied infantile sexual satisfaction \u2013 Jesus, Mary, and Joseph as one, all orifices lubricated and plugged and sliding \u2013 then fragments into a controlled farrago of a whatever-the-fuck menage a trois with Joseph devastated by Jesus' dominating fling with Mary and Jesus and Joseph jerking each other off in loving chastity and higher education, then transiently unifies in the wasp waist of an hourglass\u2026 to then flow again back into fragmentation beyond the confines of the book.But why is Joseph constipated?Because he is looking for Salvation, and Salvation is not the object here, Sainthood is. Saviours aren\u2019t what\u2019s wanted or needed, for Saviours transcend the game, remove us from it. What\u2019s wanted are Saints who emanate from the power of the Saviour, but who stay with the game, who burrow in the filth and pain and beauty, tortured by it and scarred, made ugly. What\u2019s wanted are Saints who lovingly stare down Death, roll around in the sheets with Death, and who are eventually made beautiful through their intimacy with Death, dying into the world, not away from it. There is no ultimate Resurrection, only a new Spring to be pounced upon and reveled in, let the shadows come when they may.Jesus goes mad with compassion and transcendental craziness. Mary is ruined by pricks.And Joseph shits and survives, sustained by the Blessed Catherine Tekakwitha in huge cycles of feminine spirals (Goethe\u2019s Realm of the Mothers) and all-enveloping wombs masquerading as cunts birthing a simultaneity of all times as Mary in her transcendent loveliness brought on by ruin ascends and descends sharing her blessed juices wrung from flesh with all the beautifully wretched seekers in the spartan tree houses of the world."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5278185-jason", "userReview": "I didn't get this novel.

It is my fervent hope that the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (a.k.a. l'Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es) currently underway in Canada will consult \"Beautiful Losers\" as native women in this work die like flies after having been abused by white males. Cohen's novel remains as pertinent as it was in 1966 when it was published.One of the protagonists ins none other than Kateri Tekakwitha (beatifid by John Paul II in 1980 and canonised by Benedict XVI in 2012.) One has to wonder if Cohen's novel did not accelerated the beatification process which had been stalled for over 100. Cohen considered Tekakwitha to be simultaneously close to God and utterly mad. Cohen's view was that the spirit is healed through the coit not abstinence. In Cohen's view, Tekakwitha who died at the very young age of 24 in 1680 went too far with the Catholic practices of flagellation and fasting.The narrator is a Jew living in Montreal in the 1960s, who has a masturbatory obsession for Kateri Tekakwitha, has married an indigenous woman named Edith. Although Edith has been raped by a gang of young white man, it appears to be the psychological abuse from the narrator which drives her to commit suicide at age 24. Edith is then the doppelg\u00e4nger of de Kateri. However, unlike Kateri, Edith is rather libertine. Cohen offers long passages in which he alternates descriptions of the religious extasies of Kateri with those of Edith's vagina. Cohen's writing will be considered audacious by some and in bad taste by others.In other to deal with the rising Quebec Independence movement, Cohen makes one of Edith's lovers a partisan of Quebec separating Canada. In one memorable passage the narrator accompanies the separatist in his car on his trip to Ottawa the federal capital where the separatist will be sworn in as a member of parliament. The two decide to jerk each othe off as they drive along causing their car to crash.Cohen is clearly divided on the issue of Quebec seceding from Canada. He understands why the Quebecois want to have their own country but he believes that their cause is futile. Groups acquire power only to lose it. The Mohawks defeated the Algonquins but then were conquered by the French who in turn where conquered by the English.\"Beautiful Losers\" is even worse than my review suggests. My dream is that the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (l'Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es) will ban this book which can only do damage to Cohen's legacy. GJ'esp\u00e8re que les commissaires de l'Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es qui est actuellement en cours vont consulter ce roman pendant leurs recherches car les femmes autochtones y meurent comme des mouches. En plus, elles sont toutes des victimes des abus sexuelles ou psychologiques aux mains des blancs. Les perdants magnifiques n'a rien perdu de son actualit\u00e9 depuis sa parution en 1966.Une des protagoniste est nulle autre Kateri Tekakwitha (une Mohawk b\u00e9atifi\u00e9e par Jean Paul II en 1980 et canonis\u00e9e par Benoit XVI en 2012.) On se demande si le roman de L\u00e9onard Cohen qui a augment\u00e9 la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 de Kateri Tekakwitha n'a pas contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa b\u00e9atification. Cohen la consid\u00e8re en meme temps proche de Dieu et compl\u00e8tement folle. D'apr\u00e8s Cohen ce n'est pas l'abstinence qui guerit les maux spirituels mais plut\u00f4t le co\u00eft; si Dieu prefere l'abstinence pour ses \u00e9lus, Dieu est fou. Kateri pousse trop loin les pratiques catholiques (notamment le je\u00fbne et la flagellation) et meurt \u00e0 24 ans en 1680.Le narrateur du roman qui vit \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pendant les ann\u00e9es 1960 a une obsession masturbatoire pour Kateri Tekakwitha et \u00e9pouse une jeune autochtone qui s'appelle Edith. Adolescente, Edith se fait violer par un groupe de jeune blances mais c'est la cruaut\u00e9 psychologique du narrateur qui lui pousse \u00e0 s'enlever la vie \u00e0 vingt-quatre ans. Edith est donc la doppelg\u00e4ngerin de Kateri mais contrairement \u00e0 Kateri Edith est tr\u00e8s libertine. Cohen nous donne des longs passages qui d\u00e9crivent tant\u00f4t les ecstases r\u00e9ligieux de Kateri tant\u00f4t le vagin d'Edith. Bien des admirateurs de Cohen vont dire qui'il fait preuve de beaucoup d'audace. D'autres seront bouche-b\u00e9s par le mauvais gout flagrant.Afin d'aborder le theme de la r\u00e9volution Tranquille Cohen introduit le personnage de F un politicien qui milite dans le mouvement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance de Qu\u00e9bec. F est l'amant est du narrateur et d'Edith. Dans un passage m\u00e9morable, le narrateur accompagne F \u00e0 \u00e0 Ottawa o\u00f9 F sera asserment\u00e9 comme d\u00e9put\u00e9 dans le parlement Canadien. Sur l'autoroute 30 dans la voiture de F, les deux amis se passent mutuellement une poign\u00e9e avant de d\u00e9raper. Sur la question de l'ind\u00e9pendance de Qu\u00e9bec, Cohenn est divis\u00e9. Il a des sympathies pour les Qu\u00e9becois qui veulent \u00eatre ma\u00eetres chez eux mais fondamentalment il croit que les ind\u00e9pendantistes luttent pour une cause perdue d'avance. On n'accede au pouvour que pour le perdre. Les Mohawkas ont vaincu les Algonquins. Les francais ont vaincu les Mohawks et les anglais ont conquis les francais.Les perdants magnifiques est tout \u00e0 fait execrable. Mon r\u00eave est que l'Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es ordonne la suppression qui surabonde en commentaires grivoises sur les femmes autochtones. Ce serait une bonne chose car ce roman ternit consid\u00e9rablement la r\u00e9putation de Cohen."}, {"userName": "Lara Messersmith-Glavin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/963687-lara-messersmith-glavin", "userReview": "Leonard Cohen often makes me cry. I sat on the floor of a bookstore with my hair streaming rain and collecting the smells of coffee and ink and read his book of poetry, Stranger Music, almost cover to cover, mostly in tears. I heard his words in my head long before I remembered he sometimes sang them; I like his voice, and forget to like his music.This book was strange - at first I wanted to hate it, to be bored by the leaping into the past and the Algonquins and the endless fucking and wailing and madness. I wanted to get tired with page after page of the interiors of a broken man and his bouncing, syphilitic friend. I didn't. Instead, I stayed up nights, marveling at further evidence that the world is exactly as beautiful and perverse as I often suspect it to be; wondering at the bravery and small kinks that make relationships what they are.Whole pages would trundle on before I'd realize I'd read something remarkable, that I was holding my breath. I'd skip back and look for its beginning, like chasing a thread through a darkened closet to find a sweater quietly unraveling itself. I filled pages of my journal with passages carefully copied word for word. Personal, messy, often not at all a truth that I would claim, sometimes exactly what I would have wanted to say or think or feel, if I'd had the chance or had realized sooner.What begins as a self-congratulatory, self-destructive exercise in some kind of parallel universe of writing ends as something gentle and lovely, something delicate and whole. I was impressed.\"People sneeze, F., that's all, don't make such a damn miracle out of it, it only depresses me, it's a depressing habit you have of loving to sneeze and of eating apples as if they were juicier for you and being the first one to exclaim how good the movie is.

I'll admit something about this story of a unnamed narrator, his suicided wife, their mutual friend and lover F. and the long dead but revered in the nameless narrator's memory Kateri Tekakwitha (an actual historical figure) kept me hooked and, at times, moved. But I'll also admit that for every passage in the book that lifted me up with carefully crafted (and often chuckle out loud sarcastically funny) prose, there were elsewhere three or four times that it disappointed by drifting into either untranslated French or, worse, what might as well have been gibberish. Some readers more scholarly and more patient than myself might have labored over these passages to find the beauty and brilliance within, but I was not so inclined. In the same way that something about the book kept me hooked, I can't say for sure that I won't go back to it from time to time to cherry pick through it and relive some of the better moments, perhaps even try to tackle some of those passages I found to be gibberish on first read to see if a second try might charm some sense out of them.One of the interweb's ambitious and twisted millions put more energy into his review of this book and he says a lot of things that I thought were worth saying: http://www.necessaryprose.com/acohen...."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "This is a strange book. Some of the prose is beautiful, the ideas are far out, and yet...I am not sure I like it very much.

This novel, a story of a love affiar between a mad, mystic nationalist, a dead Iroquois saint, a recently deceased wife and a broken, lonely man, is beautifully (if not grotesquely) told. Reminicisent of Joyce's wordplay and windin interior monologue, this novel is a tapestry is weaved of sex and regret, hallucinatory buddhist ramblings and the dejected voice of the one left behind.

Much of 60s counter-culture is being rediscovered now, but this does more than any Jack Kerouac or Marshall McLuhan can do, and is more involving, weirder and ultimately more serious. It is about loneliness, freezing weather and a man at the edge of his reason, endlessly mourning his lost friend/lover, 'F' and his dead wife Edith whilst researching an obscure native American Saint, Katherine Tekakwitha, in a squalid Montreal flat in the 1960s.

I can\u2019t be objective when it comes to Cohen. I just can\u2019t. When I picked up the book, I expected it to be melancholy, spiritual and deep. And at times it is very sad, at times it is spiritual. It\u2019s funny at some parts and grotesque at others. But most importantly, it is bizarre. Leonard Cohen has the amazing gift of talking about shit and making it sound like poetry (which he literally does in this book). So when I\u2019m reading about the \u201ctelephone dance\u201d, about animated sex toys that attack people, about Jesuits whipping themselves for salvation, about persecution of Native Americans, it\u2019s all beautiful. Are we all just \u201cordinary eternal machines\u201d or are we \u201cmagic\u201d? Cohen takes us through a strange journey to answer the question. He wrote this book in 1960s, in 2000 he himself writes, \u201cThis is a difficult book, even in English, if it is taken too seriously. May I suggest that you skip over the parts you don't like? Dip into it here and there. Perhaps there will be a passage, or even a page, that resonates with your curiosity. After a while, if you are sufficiently bored or unemployed, you may want to read it from cover to cover. In any case, I thank you for your interest in this odd collection of jazz riffs, pop-art jokes, religious kitsch and muffled prayer \u00e6 an interest which indicates, to my thinking, a rather reckless, though very touching, generosity on your part. Beautiful Losers was written outside, on a table set among the rocks, weeds and daisies, behind my house on Hydra, an island in the Aegean Sea. I lived there many years ago. It was a blazing hot summer. I never covered my head. What you have in your hands is more of a sunstroke than a book. Dear Reader, please forgive me if I have wasted your time.\u201dTo this I reply, Dear Mr. Cohen, thank you, for keeping magic alive."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54697-matt", "userReview": "I read this in college, at about the same time as I first gave \"Songs Of Love and Hate\" a spin.!?!It's sort of strange to think of it now, having these two bizarre (not a word I take lightly) and manaical texts as my introduction to Sad-Eyed-Lenny of the Lowlands. I'm now a huge fan and I can't shake the magic spell of his music no matter how hard I try to (I don't try very hard). His music puts me in a trance-state, he's a first run songwriter and a poet with real skill: a unique voice, an excellent sense of silence in a poem, imagery, and a uniquely wry and deadpan take on things.This book is fucked...up, though. I'm all about perversion, and I'm not offended or freaked-out so much as startled and bedazzled by the amount of erotic craziness going on here. My memory might not serve me but I'm pretty sure I decoded it well enough.The writing takes off and keeps up a furiously steady pace throughout. There's many long lyrical passages here which are going to be well-taken if they find themselves in the right hands. this one's a firecracker. Very strange, very odd, very exhuberant.I'm fairly certain that the love triangle in the story is related to (at the very least, if not the same) the one depicted in heartbreaking, haunting cadences in \"Famous Blue Raincoat\". I think there's some kind of documentary evidence to back this up somewhere."}], "description": "One of the best-known experimental novels of the 1960s, Beautiful Losers is Cohen\u2019 s most defiant and uninhibited work. The novel centres upon the hapless members of a love triangle united by their sexual obsessions and by their fascination with Catherine Tekakwitha, the 17th-century Mohawk saint. By turns vulgar, rhapsodic, and viciously witty, Beautiful Losers explores each character\u2019s attainment of a state of self-abandonment, in which the sensualist cannot be distinguished from the saint.", "title": "Beautiful Losers", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102908.Beautiful_Losers", "average": 3.64, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320500003l/102908.jpg", "reviews": 386, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/52060.Leonard_Cohen", "name": "Leonard Cohen"}], "type": ["Cultural", "Fiction", "Poetry", "Literature", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102908.Beautiful_Losers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36592288-belli-e-perdenti", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6582571-beautiful-losers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/934689.Beautiful_Losers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8153084-beautiful-losers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261146.Beautiful_Losers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17853988", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25559503", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158005.Book_of_Longing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158010.Stranger_Music", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90591.The_Favorite_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/403541.Let_Us_Compare_Mythologies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11149465-leonard-cohen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
