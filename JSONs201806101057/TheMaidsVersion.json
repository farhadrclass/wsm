There is no shortage of rumors about various causes of the disaster, but that\u2019s just the buzz disguising the real story. Listen carefully enough and the underlying truth is there, but most of the locals would prefer that it never be revealed.Alma Dunahew was a poor maid with three kids she could barely feed as she worked for a prosperous banker when the explosion occurred and killed her younger sister Ruby. Alma believes she knows what happened, but since no one is interested in hearing it, she is eventually shunned and driven half mad by the willful blindness of the town. It\u2019s only years later that she finally reveals the true story to her grandson Alek.A simple summary like that makes this book seem more linear and more of a mystery than it actually is. Daniel Woodrell tells this like an old person recounting a long story with frequent digressions and skipping back and forth through time. It\u2019s not enough to understand what happened at the dance hall, he wants to make sure you understand why it happened and how it effected everyone with the slightest connection to it.Despite the rambling nature of how it\u2019s told, it\u2019s still a short tale at 164 pages, but even though it\u2019s not a long book, when the reader gets to the end, they\u2019ll understand each and every character and what part they played.This seemed a bit different from other Woodrell books I\u2019ve read like Winter\u2019s Bone in that it had more a dreamy quality to the writing. It drifts, it doesn\u2019t walk a straight line, but it still shows that the man delivers maximum story for minimum page counts.You can read more about Woodrell and the real story behind this fictionalized version of it here."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "The Maid's Version: Daniel Woodrell's Change of Direction\nDonald Woodrell, Off Square Books, Oxford, Ms., September 11, 2013It has been seven years since Daniel Woodrell wrote his last novel, Winter's Bone. Only the small anthology of short stories, The Outlaw Album: Stories appeared after Woodrell reaped the acclaim that came with the release of the movie, \"Winter's Bone.\"My wife and I traveled to Oxford, Ms., to one of my favorite destinations, Square Books, on September 11, 2013, to hear Daniel Woodrell discuss his latest novel, The Maid's Version. I eagerly bought my copy of the novel. Author readings and signings are handled at Off Square Books, just a few doors down on the Square. The store was filling up fast when Woodrell walked in.I was surprised at his appearance. He had lost a great deal of weight. Oxford regulars surrounded Woodrell as he slowly made his way to the podium. Woodrell's discussion of his new novel was fascinating. He told us that this new novel was a change of direction from his previous works. He attributed his literary change resulted from his battle with cancer, colon cancer. The treatment had included surgery and chemotherapy. His voice was soft. One had to lean forward to catch what he had to say. It was an occasion that a public address system would have been helpful to the author and the audience. His reading was fast. It seemed to diminish his energy as he read.In summary, Woodrell explained that his illness had prompted him to consider his stories in a more introspective view. He had turned to family history and a catastrophic event in his home West Plains, Missouri, which is represented by the town of West Table, Missouri, in his previous Ozarks works.Woodrell had achieved cult status among readers in the know prior to the release of the movie \"Winter's Bone.\" I've read a number of them. The Death of Sweet Mister. Tomato Red. Winter's Bone. Give Us a Kiss is cued up close to the top of my read stack. The novels have a definite theme of good and evil. The arching theme of those novels is whether Woodrell's characters have a way out of the situation in which they find themselves. All too often the answer is no. Darkness pervades the Woodrells I have read.Woodrell is content with his new direction on the literary compass. He has said if his readers disagree with his new perspective it may not bring him affluence. However, he has found solace with \"The Maid's Version. In fact, Woodrell's next work will be set outside of the Missouri Ozarks. I am eager to see where he takes us.\"The Maid's Version\" is based on a community disaster that occurred in West Plains, Missouri, in 1928. A dance hall located over a garage exploded, killing 39 people. It has been a mystery without solution over the years. Was it an accident? Most residents don't think so. The suspected motives and wrongdoers have been discussed for years.The disaster received news coverage across the United States. A sampling of the articles may be found here: http://howell.mogenweb.org/article/wp....\nThe morning following the dance hall explosionWoodrell changes minor details in his literary work. This is not a history. The date of the explosion is changed to 1929, an acknowledgement of a changing nation on the brink of an America on the brink of the Great Depression. For pure dramatic impact, Woodrell describes the monument erected to the memory of the victims as a black angel that seems to move in a macabre dance under circumstances I leave the reader to discover.\nThe Actual Dance Hall Victims' MonumentWhere Woodrell has previously concentrated on isolated outcasts of the community, this is the story of a community facing an unexplained loss of individuals known to the community, members of it. Woodrell details the suspicions, the suspects, and lingering doubts of whether so many lives could have been lost as the result of an unexplainable accident.The narrator is Alek Dunahew who is spending the summer with his grandmother, Alma Dunahew, in West Table, Missouri. Thirty-six years have passed since the dance hall disaster. Alma is the maid whose version this tale is. Alma carries a burning anger inside her that no responsibility has ever been placed for the explosion. She passes down the story to grandson, Alek, to keep the memory of the incident alive.Alma lost someone precious to her in the fire, her sister, Ruby, a beautiful young woman, who drew many men to her as easily as a Siren. And Ruby took lover after lover until their gifts no longer inspired a continued relationship. Alma has exhibited her grief through her anger at the town's refusal to fully investigate the incident. For she is sure she has solved the mystery. In her angry pursuit for truth she has become an outcast of the community for whom the tragedy has only become an incident of history to be forgotten, or, perhaps hidden.Alma reveals the town history to Alek on walks, pointing out various landmarks, ultimately coming to the town cemetery.\n\"On these rambles the cemetery was nearly always our final destination. We'd make our way through the wilderness of headstones, gray, brown, puritan white, glancing at some, nodding at some, Alma turning her nose up at others, until we reached the Black Angel, the sober monument to our family loss and a town bereaved. Standing in the shadow of this angel she would on occasion tell me about a suspect person or deed, a vague or promising suspicion she'd acquired with her own sharp ears or general snooping, and when she shared the fishy details with me it would be the first time she'd said them aloud to anybody in years. She'd repeat herself so I would remember.\"\n\nA sudden summer storm prompts Alma to tell Alek of the town's disaster.\n\"Storm clouds were scored by bright lightning, and thunder boomed. Her dress was flapping, her eyes narrowed and distant, and she cunningly chose that raging moment to begin telling me her personal account of the Arbor Dance Hall explosion of 1929, how forty-two dancers from this small corner of the Missouri Ozarks had perished in an instant, waltzing couples murdered midstep, blown toward the clouds in a pink mist chased by towering flames, and why it happened.\"\nWest Table is a town of haves and have nots. Alma has lived her life among the poor. She has served as maid to the richest families in the town. She bristles at her services effect on her own family.\n\"She hated that she fed another man's children before she fed her own. She cleared the supper table, the plates yet rife with food in this house of plenty, potatoes played with, bread crusts stacked on the tablecloth unwanted, meat bones set aside with enough shreds on them to set her own sons fighting one another for a chance to gnaw them clean and white. Her own sons sucked cold spuds at home, waiting.\"\nAnd, in Alma's mind it is the Haves who have quietly closed the investigation. Where is justice? There must be justice.Interspersed through a narrative that grows more powerful with each page are vignettes of the couples \"murdered midstep.\" They are people you like. They are innocent. And they are doomed. It is Woodrell's testament to life no matter how simple its quality may be.Some critics have found the novel flawed by these vignettes. Their question is how could Alek possibly narrate these facts. I find no difficulty in following Woodrell's purpose or method. Alek learned of the slaughtered innocents through Alma's telling their stories. The presence of these dancers' stories strengthens rather than weakens this novel. There is great power in poignancy not laden with sentimentality.By novel's end, reader, you will have the answer. You will know the who and the how and the why. Alma will guide you there, through Alek.Woodrell continues to amaze me. It is a powerful change in literary direction. What's next? One can only wonder. But there's no question about this one.

The well dressed and stunned, the sincere in bibs and broken shoes, sat side by side and sang the hymns they had in common.\"\nThrough interconnected vignettes set before, during and after the tragedy we get quick glimpses into the lives that got disrupted by a force nobody could have predicted, a chain of consequences and choices that led to the tragic ending of a warm Saturday evening - the stories that have no real satisfying endings because of the abrupt cruel stop that was put to them.\n\"The couple were to visit his mother\u2019s people out at Rover, but the regular Arbor pianist had been stranded out at Cape Girardeau, and Lucille reluctantly agreed to sit in with the house band so the dance could proceed and her friends could frolic. Ollie sat on a windowsill with a smile that never wilted. The explosion sent them in different directions, and three days later he identified Lucille by the brooch that had burned deeply into her chest.\"\nThese stories wind their ways through time, intertwining in the unexpected places, shedding light onto the new unexpected angles, and from it emerges the portrait of community, with a spotlight on the few - the titular maid Alma DeGeer Dunahew (\n\"Grief has chomped on her like wolves do a calf\"\n), her spirited sister Ruby, Ruby's illicit lover and one of the local pillars of community Arthur Glencross, and Alma's son John Paul Dunahew, all seen through Woodrell's trademark apt phrasing that makes them step off the page and into life.\n\u201cAlma touched all twenty-eight and kissed them each, kneeling to kiss the fresh black paint between her spread aching fingers, said the same words to accompany every kiss because there was no way to know which box of wood held Ruby, or if she rested in only one, had not been separated into parts by crushing or flames and interred in two or three, so she treated every box as though her sister was inside in parts or whole and cried to the last.\u201d\nAs always, Woodrell focuses on the shadier and darker bits of human existence. No, there's no meth in this story, it being 1920s after all, but there is alcohol and the degradation that comes with too much of a good thing. There is ignorance and physical brutality. There is oppressive crushing poverty that never changes, regardless of the century, and the heavy weight of inevitable resentment fueled by glaring differences between those who have the means to escape poverty and those who are the perpetual have-nots.\n\"She hated that she fed another man's children before she fed her own. She cleared the supper table, the plates yet rife with food in this house of plenty, potatoes played with, bread crusts stacked on the tablecloth unwanted, meat bones set aside with enough shreds on them to set her own sons fighting one another for a chance to gnaw them clean and white. Her own sons sucked cold spuds at home, waiting.\"\nWoodrell's books always leave behind a quiet uneasy feeling once the last page is turned. This one is no exception to this. It's my third Woodrell, and now I have no doubt that in the near future I will read every single book he has written and will write because they are fully worth every minute you spend reading them. 4 stars.-------------------My reviews of other books by Daniel Woodrell:Winter's BoneTomato Red"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "This fulfills my growing fandom over Woodrell\u2019s writing. With two favorable reads to lead me on (\u201cWinter\u2019s Bone\u201d and \u201cWoe to Live On\u201d), I welcome again his crisp prose, ear for regional dialog, and affinity for a plot that puts questing personalities into challenges of morality and courage. As with the earlier two, I appreciate the rural places of the Missouri Ozarks region he portrays so vividly based on having grown up nearby in the rural Oklahoma Ozark fringes. I can\u2019t yet speak to Woodrell\u2019s earlier, reportedly noirish, detective fiction, but he appears to be applying this craft to the characters in this tale, a boy and his great aunt obsessed with resolving the mystery of a community tragedy from decades before in 1929. The family and community impacts of a tragic explosion at a town dance is powerfully woven into the story 12-year old Alek draws out of his great aunt Alma, whose sister Ruby was killed along with 41 others. He is placed with her for a summer in the 60s and becomes captivated with Alma\u2019s reconstruction of the disaster and then the events leading toward and emerging from it. She can\u2019t help weighing of all the potential perpetrators of the unsolved crime that continues to haunt and weigh upon the community. Alma then worked as a maid for a prominent household and had taken her sister in to save her from their brutal father with her family. She is stuck in a hardscrabble life of raising two sons with an absentee alcoholic husband and can\u2019t help being vicariously lifting up with the love of life shown by her teenaged sister, Ruby. But Ruby\u2019s particular love of men and her propensity to change models when it suited her worried Alma at the time and continues to prey in her imagination as tied up with the event somehow. Like the town itself, she needs a personal face for the evil behind the blasted life she has been living, not the ominous shadow of some kind of cosmic or divine retribution. And in Alma\u2019s courageous walk on the edge of madness for so long Alek finds something that helps him begin to grow up and surmount the impact of festering secrets held by his own father surrounding these events.She lived scared and angry, a life full of permanent grievances, sharp animosities and cold memories for all who\u2019d ever crossed us, any of us, ever. Alma DeGreer Dunahew, with her pinched, hostile nature, her dark obsessions and primal need for revenge, was the big red heart of our family, the true heart, the one we keep secret and that sustains us.It was years before I learned to love her.I soon grew to respect for Alma\u2019s resilience and empathize with her hunger for some resolution. Trapdoors in Woodrell\u2019s narrative transport you like a time machine back to Alma and Ruby\u2019s struggle together in poverty while those with more power fiddled in conspicuous consumption on the brink of conflagration. The kind of rocks Alma and Alek turn over in their slow review end up creating a profile of weaknesses in the heart of the whole community, including mad men seeking attention, religious leaders calling down vengeance for pervasive sinning, corrupt law enforcement in the pockets of the wealthy, criminal networks spilling out into rural areas from St. Louis, and specific men driven by jealousy. So many families were devastated by the losses, and Alma sustained other major subsequent losses in her life. But Ruby\u2019s death put her way off course. She represented something special to all those she touched with her life, felt even by Alma\u2019s young children and Alek\u2019s father for a time when he was in their household:They loved to hug her and feel her arms around their shoulders in return, squeezing them near to smell her perfume, her lipstick, her smoky breath so exciting as it burst into their faces. Ruby\u2019s style, her looks, her sass and vinegar gave them the urge to fight for more, more of everything they could imagine, against anybody, whenever she was near. This story captivated me with its focus on a tragic event and its ripples and resonance in the lives of a boy near the beginning of his life, an old woman near the end of hers, and a rural community at a particular point in history. Although inspired from a similar historical incident in 1928, the Arbor Dance Hall explosion in West Plains, this gem of a story was spun largely out of Woodrell\u2019s fertile imagination."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "What an extraordinary novella this is! It's the story of an old woman telling her grandson about what she knows of a horrific event that happened decades ago. It's also the story a small town in Missouri and how it deals with a tragedy. It also has a love story.That Woodrell has accomplished all of that in 164 pages is impressive. And with such beautiful prose! This is my first Woodrell book, but it won't be my last.The story opens with Alma DeGeer Dunahew sharing what she knows about a 1929 explosion at a dance hall that killed dozens in the town, including Alma's sister, Ruby. Alma is spending time with her grandson, who begins the book with this description of her:\"She frightened me at every dawn the summer I stayed with her. She'd sit on the edge of her bed, long hair down, down to the floor and shaking as she brushed and brushed, shadows ebbing from the room and early light flowing in through both windows. Her hair was as long as her story and she couldn't walk when her hair was not woven into dense braids and pinned around and atop her head. Otherwise her hair dragged the floor like the train of a medieval gown and she had to gather it into a sheaf and coil it about her forearm several times to walk the floor without stepping on herself. She'd been born a farm girl, then served as a maid for half a century, so she couldn't sleep past dawn to win a bet, and all the mornings I knew with her she'd sit in the first light and brush that witchy-long hair, brush it in sections, over and over, stroking hair that had scarcely been touched by scissors for decades, hair she would not part with despite the extravagance of time it required at each dawn. The hair was mostly white smeared by gray, the hues of a newspaper that lay in the rain until headlines blended across the page ... It was years before I learned to love her.\"I italicized the line about being born a farm girl because I liked it so much. Anyway, Alma was a longtime maid of Arthur Glencross, who was an important banker in town. We soon learn that Arthur had been having an affair with Ruby, and Alma wasn't happy about it. When Ruby broke up with Arthur, it caused a rift. The night of the explosion, several townsfolk saw Arthur acting suspiciously, running through streets and speeding away in his car. But wait! Before you jump to conclusions about who or what caused the explosion at the dance hall, you need to meet the rest of the town. Each chapter brings us different voices, different narrators, and the pieces of the puzzle start to come together. We meet Alma's husband and children, Ruby's lovers, and many of the people who were at the dance hall that night. An especially moving chapter was the description of the memorial service for the victims: \"The town was represented from high to low, the disaster spared no class or faith, cut into every neighborhood and congregation, spread sadness with an indifferent aim. The well dressed and stunned, the sincere in bibs and broken shoes, sat side by side and sang the hymns they had in common.\"I like writers who can masterfully share multiple perspectives of a story and create a narrative that flows between the past and the present. The structure of the book reminded me of a few others I had liked: \"So Long, See You Tomorrow\" by William Maxwell and \"The Sweet Hereafter\" by Russell Banks. The prose truly is lovely; I paused numerous times to reread a pretty sentence.If you prefer a linear story with only one narrator, you might not enjoy this book. But if you like beautiful prose, a rich cast of characters and stories with a bit of mystery, you might love this."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "Trains have haunted the nights in West Table since 1883 and disrupt sleep and taunt those awakened. The trains beating past towards the fabled beyond, the sound of each wheel-thump singing, 'You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere', and these wheels are, they are, they are going far from where you lie listening in your smallness and will still lie small at dawn after they are gone from hearing, rolling on singing along twin rails over the next hill and down and up over the next onward to those milk-and-honey environs where motion pictures happen for real and history is made and large dashing lives you won't lead or even witness are lived. Daniel Woodrell revisits in his latest novel his favorite setting a ong the isolated, impoverished, 'backward' Ozark communities. The framework of the story is not so different from Winter's Bone : a murder / mystery that allows the author to explore in detail the lifestyle, the hardships, the personal tragedies, the apparent fragility of simple people that hide inside their closely guarded hearts tremendous reserves of determination and endurance.Tha maid from the title is the grandmother of the narrator - her teenage nephew who over a summer visit listens to her recollections of the event that destroyed her life. Alma DeGeer Dunahew, with her pinched, hostile nature, her dark obsessions and primal need for revenge, was the big red heart of our family, the true heart, the one we keep secret and that sustains us. The people of the Ozarks have a saying for people like her: Grief has chomped on her like wolves do a calf. Alma knows about pain and loss in excruciating detail. Her resentment about the people who abused her and the town who ignored or tried to deny the crime that took away her father, her sister, her child, is justified. The novel proposes to redeem her life by presenting her personal account of said events:The Arbor Dance Hall explosion of 1929, how forty-two dancers from this small corner of the Missouri Ozarks had perished in an instant, waltzing couples murdered mid-step, blown towards the clouds in a pink mist chased by towering flames. The narration is non-linear and multi-generational, investigating not only the night of the explosion, but the histories of the people involved, the plight of the survivors, the failed official inquests, the rumours, the bitter recriminations and the slow acceptance and rebuilding of a shattered community.If the story can be said to have pivotal point, it is the doomed love story of Alma's sister Ruby with a banker from the city, pitting the girl's zest for life and passionate nature against the conventions of society and the selfishness of the powerful. Alma and Ruby are as different as night and day, one dour, hardworking and resigned with her station in life as a servant, the other living for pleasure and laughter. Yet they are clearly a family and support each other.Despite the slimness of the volume, the material offered is of such richness and diversity I felt as if I read a big historical epic, touching deftly on individual destinies over generations, class struggles, world wars and druglords vendettas, tragedy and redemption walking hand in hand. Just one more example of the economy of words Woodrell employs, that yet conveys loads of ideas and nuances, in the case of one fundamentalist preacher that used to rant against people dancing in the town, one of the suspects in the explosion:\u00a0Preacher Willard accepted the Ten Commandments as a halfhearted start but kept adding amendments until the number of sins he couldn't countenance was beyond memorization. He appeared to be adding new ones shaped to your own reported shortcomings until you were tailored appropriately for a residence in hell, and nowhere else, but a complete and prostrate begging of God and an increased tithe might, just might, earn you more chance at heaven, who knows, give it a try, it's only money. My second novel by Daniel Woodrell was in conclusion the confirmation I needed he is not a one hit wonder, and I will add him to my growing list of authors to buy on publication. As a closing remark I will return to the opening lines of the novel, a quote attributed to Rolf Jacobsen, that I feel is an apt resume of the vibe I got from the lecture. These are the things the starry sky is set above:Loneliness of the dead, courage of youth,And timber that is slowly away on great rivers."}, {"userName": "Cameran", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16033752-cameran", "userReview": "It took some time for me to settle into the rhythm of this book. When I began to read I found the structure to be awkward and unsettled. This is one of those stories that requires concentration since the timeline of events jumps around rather than unfold in a linear structure -- so if you do not enjoy books that forgo the linear, then I can see a great struggle as you read this.The Maid\u2019s Version is the story of a woman named Alma, who has lost her sister in a tragic accident when the town's dance hall explodes. Alma knows behind-the-scenes details of what occurred before the tragedy struck, therefore she is aware of the responsible party for the loss of so many lives. The town, however, decides to regard her as crazy since they do not wish to seek justice if the responsible party is a wealthy member of society. Years later and still haunted by what she knows, she recounts the story to her grandson and advises him to tell it to us.Did I like this book? I am not even sure. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the structure of the storytelling had been more linear. The underlying story of the dance hall fire and the people involved was less dynamic due to the way the story wandered between characters and time periods too much.

The structure was very choppy and lacked a good flow. I'm all about a non-linear story, but this one, in my opinion, wasn't crafted well. Toss into that the many characters and it was a jumble. The \"side chapters\" with stories about those in the dance hall - were those added to make me feel worse about the disaster of the explosion at the dance hall? Ironically, I felt those little tossed in stories were more memorable than the core story. I also didn't connect to the main characters. I felt like I should have loved Alma more. I should have felt more saddened by her mental spiral after the explosion and her son's death. But, I found myself just reading along without feeling badly. I can honest say that I have felt more emotionally connected to news articles. I feel all of these feelings about the book are related to the structure and the character development. The only other part of the book I didn't like was how abruptly the true events are revealed. It seemed an abrupt ending. And I couldn't help but think - would I have enjoyed the story more if it had been crafted in a way where I was left \"knowing\" the truth without having to be explicitly shown the truth? I think maybe??? I don't want to sound negative-nelly about the book. I enjoyed the overall idea.

This one does all come together nicely but it did seem to jump around. Some of the writing is exquisite. The author constructs some truly beautiful sentences. I'd like to say this is a very long book, but that would be highlighting another of my character flaws. I read it inside a day, which is remarkable for me -- my last read took me six weeks.

In 1928, the tiny town of West Table, Missouri, was shattered by the explosion of the Arbor Dance Hall. Forty-two of the town's residents were killed in the explosion and in the fire that followed; dozens of others were injured. But although many explanations for the tragedy were put forward, the guilty party or parties were never identified and prosecuted.Some townspeople blamed local gypsies; others thought that St. Louis mobsters were responsible. Some wondered if the explosion was the work of the local minister who preached hell and damnation and who railed against the \"sinners\" who patronized the dance hall.Alma Dunahew is the mother of three boys and works as a domestic in the house of the town's leading banker. Alma's sister, Ruby, is a carefree young woman who uses and disposes of men as the spirit moves her, until the night she too becomes a victim of the dance hall tragedy.Alma has her own idea about what happened that night, and as the incident overwhelms her emotionally, she gradually loses touch with reality. She alienates members of her own family and many of the townspeople; she loses her job and has to cobble together a living as best she can.Years later, in 1965, her grandson Alek is sent to spend the summer with her and over the course of the summer, Alma slowly tells him the story of the events that led to the explosion of the dance hall. It's a riveting tale, told mostly in flashbacks and it grabs the reader from the opening line. \"She frightened me at every dawn the summer I stayed with her,\" young Alek later recalls.

It is a story that centers on an explosion and fire at a dance hall that killed more than forty people and still resonates in the history of the town. The person responsible was never caught - but was perhaps known. A mystery, a series of character studies, an examination of a pivotal point in a history, the book is a wonder.

Years later, Alek remembers his grandmother's tale after attending a memorial service for the victims. Alma refused to cut her hair after her beloved sister Ruby's death, and Alek describes it, \"Her hair was as long as her story and she couldn't walk when her hair was not woven into dense braids and pinned around and atop her head....The hair was mostly white smeared by gray, the hues of a newpaper that lay in the rain until headlines blended across the page.\"As a maid for a prominent banker, Alma was privy to many secrets of both the victims and the suspects of the unsolved murders at the dance hall. The book is a story about a community wondering if there is a cover-up, while they also are dealing with the loss of their loved ones. It also shows the economic inequalities in the community as Alma sneaks out half-eaten meals from her employer's house to turn into soup to feed her own children.The author writes beautiful passages in the voice of the people of the Ozarks.

She was lonely, old and proud, and I\u2019d been sent from the river town near St. Louis by my dad as a gesture of reconciliation.\nNarrator Alek tells the story of a small town disaster in 1929 as recalled by his grandmother, a former maid to the town\u2019s wealthiest family, \u201chow forty-two dancers from this small corner of the Missouri Ozarks had perished in an instant, waltzing couples murdered midstep, blown toward the clouds in a pink mist chased by towering flames, and why it happened.\u201d The parties responsible for the explosion were never officially exposed, charged or punished, but people knew things that were never publicly acknowledged. The writing is gorgeous, and I think I like this even more than I did Woodrell\u2019s very fine novel Winter\u2019s Bone. A couple of small things keep this from being a 5-star for me, minor quibbles really, considering the quality of the prose and the compelling nature of the story. I would have been happier with a more symmetrical structure, in place of the somewhat haphazard arrangement of points of view, timeline shifts, and random presentations of different characters. The people and relationships in Alma\u2019s own extended family were numerous and important to the story, but also confusing, so I was reduced to the indignity of having to create a family tree to keep them all straight. And the chapters were comprised of seemingly random narrations about various family members and townspeople and how they related to one another and to the fatal event at various times over several decades. However, my irritation at this dropped away after a while, as I learned the players and got lost in the story, the language, and the vividly drawn characters. There\u2019s a lovely cadence to the writing, and I appreciated Woodrell\u2019s skill with syntax and choice of details that often turned what might have been ordinary description into a joy to read: \nThey were both so ill made for the social ramble that folks who cared felt nervous for them when they did go out to join the human parade, afraid one misfit or the other might spill a drink that stained a popular girl\u2019s dress, or during a fast song, trip by accident someone given to sneered and eminently repeatable sarcasm, or that mean boys who\u2019d arrived stag would come up with a rough prank and spring it on Joe in front of Molly, make him shrink to nothing in her eyes, and his own. \nThis was a quick two-day read and goes on my \"best books under 200 pages\" shelf.

I don't know if I've felt more pleasure reading the last few years thn when delving into Woodrell's work. I hesitate to say reading Woodrell is fun, although it is, but reading Woodrell is more than fun. Reading The Maid's Version was, for me, like watching that movie you ached to see for months and, when you finally sit in the theater that first night, it's as good if not better than expected. I would wish the novel lengthier than it 164 pages but I sensed the book ended right when it should. I'm selfish to want more.The Maid's Version inhabits a small town mystery as told to a child (now grown) by his proud, ancient, insane grandmother. It's intricate, more intricate than expected, and while not quite the country noir of Woodrell's earliest books it lives in the same neighborhood, just a fancier house. The smart outsider of a narrator recognizes bad decisions as tragic and both fated and, if people weren't so filled with hot blood, avoidable. If Woodrell's a moralist, however, he's a moralist at a deep and elemental level where people were probably going to do what they did anyway because the other choice feels like acquiescence to something shallow and hateful. Woodrell's language matches and perhaps exceeds his storytelling. His words embody the droll, profound, and ruinous, often in the same paragraph:And there were the anniversary confessions. In the first decade after the conflagration perhaps a dozen complete or merely suggestive confessions were taken, all easily refuted, and the confessed would be returned to homes where relatives dealing with the Great Depression promised to watch over their lonesome addled kin and spend more time with them on Sundays if they could manage it, though it seemed nearly to blaspheme basic heavenly intentions to feed crazy folks when sane ones went about starving. Two of the more eager confessors were next-door neighbors who became perennials and their testimonies expanded in competition over the years into picaresque recitations of unforgivable guilt and delicious subplots of scurrilous intrigue everybody heard in detail one way or another, and plenty came to look forward to hearing yearly the advances delivered as both men tried anew to talk themselves into being hanged before the other. When one neighbor in 1937 drank raw milk too late and died, the other did sadly resign himself to not ever being hanged by others and gave up all confessing.Christ. So good. So much fun.

The story explores the politics, corruption and repression of legal investigations while viewed from the perspective of the poorest of the poor (most with poor ways) in a poor community during a time when times were poor.

This is a short book with a simple plot of an old lady retelling an horrific story from the past to her 12-year-old grandson one summer when he stays with her for the first time. The main narrator is the grandson, grown up, but the book uses one of my favourite devices and that is to have a variety of narrators tell the story from their own point of view. With the lyrical writing and the fine story this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. We get a look inside the lives of ordinary people; the huge mountains made out of small dilemmas; the backstabbing, the affairs, the jealousy, the gossip, all the ugly things that run rampant in a very small community. But it is rather ironic how the town's greatest disaster is a secret so simple no one can uncover it. A good book, but honestly I must say I felt disappointed at the end.

The book centers around the mystery of the explosion at Arbor Dance Hall in 1929. The explosion killed 42 people, many unrecognizable in death with their bodies broken up or burned beyond recognition. Alma Dunahew lost her sister Ruby in the explosion and for years has been trying to discover the answer to what happened. Those years have been hard on her with several of them spent at the Work Farm in West Table, Missouri, due to her psychic breakdown caused by rage and grief. Many of the town's most wealthy citizens want to put the truth of the explosion to the side and no one has ever been apprehended for the crime. They look at Alma's ramblings about the explosion as words from a crazy person. The magnitude of the explosion was enormous. \"Just as full darkness fell those happy sounds heard in the surviving house suddenly became a nightmare chorus of pleas, cries of terror, screams as the flames neared crackling and bricks returned tumbling from the heavens and stout beams crushed those souls knocked to the ground. Walls shook and shuddered for a mile around and the boom was heard faintly in the next county south and painfully by everyone in the town limits.\"One summer in 1965, Alma's young grandson Alec comes to visit her. It is to him that she spills the story of the dance hall and her theory about what happened that night. Going back and forth in time, the novel gives the reader vignettes about those who were killed in the dance hall explosion along with the story of Ruby, Alma's sister. Ruby was a great flirt and what was called in those days a loose woman. She would love them and leave them until she found a real love with the banker, Arthur Glencross. Glencross was married and Alma worked as a maid for the Glencross family. She worked very hard to hide Arthur's affair from his wife Corrine by carefully washing his clothing to get out smells and stains that would serve as evidence of his affair with Ruby. After Ruby's death, Alma hated Arthur and this was evident in her actions. But was Arthur responsible for the explosion? It could have been the preacher Isaiah Willard who spoke of death and damnation to those who danced. He believed that \"the easiest portals to the soul through which demons might enter was that opened by dancing feet. Evil music, evil feet, salacious sliding and the disgusting embraces dancing excused provided an avenue of damnation that could readily be seen and blockaded\" He was heard to say of the Arbor Dance Hall during that summer, \"I'll blow this place to Kingdom soon and drop those sinners into the boiling patch - see how they dance then.\" What about the hobos hanging around town? Those passing through with bad intentions? Someone with a grudge against one of the dancers? Who was it? Alma thinks she knows and tells her story to Alec.Of the 42 killed in the explosion, only 28 were whole enough so that graves could be made for them. Most of them were not identified. The rest were parts buried in a pit. Alma's grief was such that she \"touched all twenty-eight and kissed them each, kneeling to kiss the fresh black paint between her spread aching fingers, said the same words to accompany every kiss because there was no way to know which box of wood held Ruby, or if she rested in only one, had not been separated into parts by crushing or flames and interred in two or three, so she treated every box as though her sister was inside in parts or whole and cried to the last.\"Woodrell's style of writing is unique, sounding like I'd imagine the tenor of speech spoken in the Ozarks. At times it's a difficult book because of the writing style and the subject matter. It is, however, stunning and has left me with a deep and abiding appreciation for this author's work.

Her husband is mostly gone and her younger sister is too often the gossip of this small town. Ruby is a pretty young girl and learned early on how to trade her looks and favors for the attention of the older married men of West Table. They would buy her what she wanted but they would often misunderstand how much they owned her. Alma would have to save her younger sister from time to time from the beatings and scandal. Until the local dance hall explosion and fire of 1929, where 42 people were killed. Including Ruby. Many different people were suspected of the fire. From mobsters, to gypsies, to a local preacher who damned the patrons of the dance hall as sinners burning in the fires on Earth before they were sent to the fires of Hell.But for Alma, there could only be one answer. The fire was set to kill her sister Ruby and keep the dark secrets of the married man she was sleeping with. The man, being the very head of the household that Alma was the Maid for.\"...During those years in which Alma DeGeer Dunahew was considered to have become crazy, her brain turned to diseased meat by the unchecked spread of suspicion amidst a white simmering and reckless hostility, a caustic sickness between her ears could be witnessed by viewing the erosion of the very color in her eyes as she raged and the involuntary sideways tug of her lips as each heated word was thrown. Folks said, 'Grief has chomped on her like wolves do a calf...\"In The Maid's Version, Woodrell digs into the various probabilities and answers as to who may have set the fire. But also putting front and center the suspicions of Alma and the cover up she believed happened by the town and its leaders. Generations pass as her own children turn their backs on her and until her own grand child may be the only one to search for the truth she holds dear. Justice for a sister that no one else missed. That hurt many others in her own selfishness but never deserved to die along with 41 other innocent lives.Woodrell's narrative is calm and steady, he allows the plot and setting to move the tale forward. His characters rich and true. You know these people. You have met them. Only you do your best to pass them by and not be caught up in their world even though you know that your own curiosity will betray you. As he did in his brilliant, Winter's Bone, Woodrell displays the glimmer of truth being buried by the overwhelming sense of hopelessness his characters face.

There aren't many widely-read novelists who hail from (and write about) the Missouri Ozarks, and there are even fewer of them successful enough to have Jennifer Lawrence-led film adaptations made of their work, so it's natural enough that Ozarkians cherish him. I've attended a Q&A with Woodrell, I've driven through his hometown countless times, I've seen the aforementioned Jennifer Lawrence film, and I've had more than a few conversations with other literary folks about his work, but somehow it wasn't till this year that I got around to reading one of his books for myself.I'll admit I was a bit disappointed. The Maid's Version is the story of a small town called West Table (modeled closely on Woodrell's own home base of West Plains), which is blindsided by tragedy in the summer of 1929 in the form of a deadly and mysterious dance-hall explosion. (This too is rooted in real history.) We see the disaster and its aftermath from many characters' points of view, and learn a lot about the town and its inhabitants in the process. Theoretically, this should have been just my kind of story: I, too, grew up in a small Ozarks town, and I tend to really enjoy this kind of panoramic effect when executed well. (I just read and loved \nMrs. Dalloway\n, which is about as panoramic as they come.) But despite all that, I just couldn't get engaged.I think part of the problem was the writing. Woodrell has quite clearly positioned his work as a sort of Midwest answer to the Southern Gothic genre, and his prose owes a big debt to the gritty-but-grandiloquent stylings of William Faulkner, Cormac McCarthy, and the like. The effect, at times, is beautiful, but it's just as often convoluted and\u2014to me, at least\u2014a little pretentious. There's no such thing as a to-the-point sentence in The Maid's Version, no paragraph that doesn't contain three times many words as it might in a more economical author's hands. \"Every two weeks\" becomes \"On days spaced two weeks apart.\" Passages like this one (describing, in this case, the ruins of a burned-down building) show up on every page:\nThe congregated silhouettes of ruin attracted steady visitors who arrived most evenings around sunset to stand and behold in the everyday wonder of sinking light just what contortions tragedy had wrought and left in view. Remains of wall torn to fractions still somehow stood here and there to make partial and keening shapes in the gloaming. Dogs had for a time gathered on the spot in snorting packs, but the siren stench of rot from the pit had finally wavered and blown away...\nYou get the picture. I like florid sentences as much as anyone\u2014I count Virginia Woolf, Oscar Wilde, and Edgar Allan Poe among my favorite writers\u2014but this sort of \"manly,\" minimum-punctuation variant of purple prose just starts to irritate me after awhile, to seem forced and willfully obscure. It's not that Woodrell can't write, it's just that... well, as one of his own characters says of Shakespeare, \"That flowery fart has things to say, but he sure doesn't make it easy to get what he means.\"My other complaint is a little more personal, and I'm willing to admit my own bias. It boils down to this: for all the praise Woodrell has received for his depiction of this part of the world, for all the reviews on this site and elsewhere raving about his no-holds-barred portrayal of rural life in the Ozarks, I don't really find his version of this place very true to anything I recognize. I'm no stranger to country folks\u2014my grandparents on my father's side were farmers, and I went to high school within view of a cow pasture\u2014and I certainly don't have a romantic or even particularly affectionate view of small-town life, but the overblown hillbillies that populate this book read more like cartoons than anyone I've met in person. Take this bit of dialogue, spoken by a grudge-holding old woman to her grandson:\n\"That place there was home to Mrs. Prater, who cheated me of near eleven dollars when your uncle Sidney was a-dyin' in bed with no medicine for the pain. He moaned constant as the wind and couldn't catch his breath. Not even fourteen years old. She had her a few daughters, and one has married here and stayed\u2014her children are named Cozzens. Couple of boys. Your big brother could whup either of them pukes without even needin' to put his sandwich down. Years to come you'll thrash 'em too, if you should be so blessed as to come across one somewhere behind a building, or in the trees, and hear that name.\"\nOr this, from a teenage boy whose baseball game has just been interrupted by the discovery of a body:\n\"Well, I reckon he's in a red handcart to hell by now, about to get fried up good in his own grease\u2014he'll keep\u2014it's only the seventh inning.\"\nDo you see what I mean? It's not that rural people don't employ the occasional colorful expression or that their grammar is always immaculate, but to present this down-home caricature of country speak as the the \"authentic\" voice of an entire region (and then to be praised endlessly by critics and readers alike for that \"authenticity\") just feels, well... kind of disingenuous to me. But then again, I'm sure there are people in Georgia who'd say the same of Flannery O'Connor.This review has been a bit critical, and I don't want to give the impression I hated The Maid's Version. I did find a good deal to appreciate here, particularly in Woodrell's insightful and frequently poignant observations on character, and I plan to read more of his work before I come to any lasting conclusions. To balance out the negativity a bit, I'll close with a passage I found touching, and which spoke to my experiences as a small-town boy much more deeply than any folksy figure of speech or elaborate description of scenery could:\nTrains have haunted the nights in West Table since 1883 and disrupt sleep and taunt those awakened. The trains beating past toward the fabled beyond, the sound of each wheel-thump singing, You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere, you're going nowhere, and these wheels are, they are, they are going far away from where you lie listening in your smallness and will lie still small at dawn after they are gone from hearing, rolling on singing along twin rails over the next hill and down and up over the next onward to those milk-and-honey environs where motion pictures happen for real and history is made and large dashing lives you won't lead or even witness are lived.\nThat's what growing up in the middle of nowhere feels like. If this book had had more of that and less of the rest, I'd be sold."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "The opening sentence and paragraph has you have an image strike up in your head, an archaic one full of mystery, a maid thee maid of this tale.This tale brings you back in time as this wise and mystical lady, a grandma, tells of a tragedy, a fire.She is a character that stays and reverberates in the tale.That long lavish hair has a mystery behind it, as that of a long swirl of smoke rising to the skies from the dance-hall fire, a melancholy presence beheld in that hair. She pieces together and tells to the younger ones of the days preceding and the day itself of the fire and the one guilty of the heinous crime.Daniel Woodrell hooks you in with the first paragraph and then on grips you masterly along the right pace no words wasted, he unravels and tells through this grandma Alma of the mystery of a once deadly dance-hall fire that had taken loved ones in this Ozraks town.As the incident is unravelled the author has you immersed in the mystery behind the arsonist and the men and women of this Ozark vicinity.This great tale takes me back to the great short by Faulkner \u2018Barn Burning,\u2019 along with Fahrenheit 451, these are three stories involving fire and burning that will survive the test of time and remain great works to be revisited and read again and again.Daniel Woodrell is a formidable force in crafting vivid and memorable characters, steeped in history, Language, and setting.He is the storyteller of the Ozaks just as the eminent William Faulkner was of the Yoknapatawpha County.He has a distinctive prose and mastery with writing with language and certain denizens of a town or village like that of Faulkner and in Joyce\u2019s dubliners he is for sure a people\u2019s voice and storyteller.Americas best kept secret unless you\u2019ve seen the movie Winters Bone then you would have learned of the ways of this rural Shakespearian tragedy conjurer, a rural noir writer at it finest.That opening paragraph.\u201cShe frightened me at every dawn the summer I stayed with her. She\u2019d sit on the edge of her bed, long hair down, down to the floor and shaking as she brushed and brushed, shadows ebbing from the room and early light flowing in through both windows. Her hair was as long as her story and she couldn\u2019t walk when her hair was not woven into dense braids and pinned around and atop her head. Otherwise her hair dragged the floor like the train of a medieval gown and she had to gather it into a sheaf and coil it about her forearm several times to walk the floor without stepping on herself. She\u2019d been born a farm girl, then served as a maid for half a century, so she couldn\u2019t sleep past dawn to win a bet, and all the mornings I knew with her she\u2019d sit in the first light and brush that witchy-long hair, brush it in sections, over and over, stroking hair that had scarcely been touched by scissors for decades, hair she would not part with despite the extravagance of time it required at each dawn. The hair was mostly white smeared by gray, the hues of a newspaper that lay in the rain until headlines blended across the page.\u201d\u201cHer name was Alma and she did not care to be called Grandma or Mamaw, and might loose a slap if addressed as Granny. She was lonely, old and proud, and I\u2019d been sent from my river town near St. Louis by my dad as a gesture of reconciliation. She was glad I\u2019d been sent and concerned that I have a good time, a memorable summer, but she was not naturally given to much frolic; the last hours of play she\u2019d known had been before World War I, some game now vanished from childhood that involved a rolling wooden hoop and a short stick. She tried taking me for long walks about the town of West Table, going to Peoples Park so she could watch me splash in the pool, let me pull weeds in the garden and throw a baseball against the toolshed door. It was the summer of 1965, but she still did not have a television, only a radio that seemed always to be announcing livestock prices and yield estimates. There was a twang stretching every word Alma said, but for days and days she didn\u2019t say much. Then came a late afternoon when I was dramatically dispirited, moody and bored, foot idly kicking at things I\u2019d been told not to kick, a sweltering day that turned dark as a sinister storm settled overhead, and we sat together on her small porch in a strong wind to watch those vivid actions break across the sky. Storm clouds were scored by bright lightning, and thunder boomed. Her dress was flapping, her eyes narrowed and distant, and she cunningly chose that raging moment to begin telling me her personal account of the Arbor Dance Hall explosion of 1929, how forty-two dancers from this small corner of the Missouri Ozarks had perished in an instant, waltzing couples murdered midstep, blown toward the clouds in a pink mist chased by towering flames, and why it happened. This was more like it\u2014an excitement of fire, so many fallen, so many suspects, so few facts, a great crime or colossal accident, an ongoing mystery she thought she\u2019d solved. I knew this was a story my dad did not want me to hear from her lips, as it was a main source of their feud, so I was tickled and keen to hear more, more, and then more. Dozens were left maimed, broken in their parts, scorched until skin melted from bones. The screams from the rubble and flames never faded from the ears of those who heard them, the cries of burning neighbors, friends, lovers, and kinfolk like my great-aunt Ruby. So many young dead or ruined from a town of only four thousand raised a shocked, grievous howling for justice. Suspicions were given voice, threats shouted, mobs gathered, but there was no obvious target for all the summoned fury. Suspects and possible explanations for the blast were so numerous and diverse, unlinked by convincing evidence, that the public investigation spun feebly in a wide, sputtering circle, then was quietly closed. No one was ever officially charged nor punished, and the twenty-eight unidentified dead were buried together beneath a monumental angel that stood ten feet tall and slowly turned black during year after year of cold and hot and slapping rain.\u201d\u201cA near portion of the sky founted an orange brilliance in a risen tower, heat bellowing as flames freshened in the breeze and grew, the tow r of orange tilting, tossing about, and the sounds dancers let loose began to reach distant ears as anonymous wails and torture those nearby with their clarity of expression. There were those who claimed to have heard words of farewell offered by victims in the air or in the rubble, and some must be true accounts; so many citizens crawled into the flames to pull at blistered, smoking bodies that turned out to be people they knew, sisters, uncles, sons or pals. As with any catastrophe, the witness accounts immediately began to differ, as some saw dancers from blown three hundred feet toward the stars and spreading in a spatter of directions, while others saw them go no more than a hundred and fifty feet high, give or take, though all agreed that several fortunate souls were saved from death by the force of their throwing, landing beyond reach of the scorching, pelted with falling debris, yes, and damaged, but not roasted skinless, hairless, blackened and twisted on their bones.\u201dhttp://more2read.com/review/maids-version-daniel-woodrell/"}], "description": "Alma DeGeer Dunahew, the mother of three young boys, works as the maid for a prominent citizen and his family in West Table, Missouri. Her husband is mostly absent, and, in 1929, her scandalous, beloved younger sister is one of the 42 killed in an explosion at the local dance hall. Who is to blame? Mobsters from St. Louis? The embittered local gypsies? The preacher who railed against the loose morals of the waltzing couples? Or could it have been a colossal accident? Alma thinks she knows the answer-and that its roots lie in a dangerous love affair. Her dogged pursuit of justice makes her an outcast and causes a long-standing rift with her own son. By telling her story to her grandson, she finally gains some solace-and peace for her sister. He is advised to \"Tell it.
