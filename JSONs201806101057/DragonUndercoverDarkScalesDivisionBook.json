I cannot wait until i can learn more about this Dark Scales Division that Owen is a part of, at the moment he is working undercover to find a psychopath by the name of Liam Huff. He rents a place right next door to the woman who will become his mate. Not the best timing for finding one's mate but who says fate works the way you want it. Nadia and her sister Sage are having a sister week before Sage is off to college. Nadia and Owen hit it off right away then Sage gets kidnapped by Huff.That is just how this story starts. I like it a lot Snow and Courtney members of Owen's team sound like interesting dragons to get to know better so I am looking forward to more stories. I highly recommend this to all my dragon loving friends.I voluntarily read an advance copy and have not been compensated in any way for this opinion. But judge it for yourself I think you'll like it."}, {"userName": "Ola Adamska", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16049918-ola-adamska", "userReview": "Pretty good start to the new series - fast-paced, a lot happens, characters are intriguing and you will be captivated by what is going on, as every page bring something NEW!"}, {"userName": "Topsues", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58197136-topsues", "userReview": "A great read, sexy man, lakes, dragons and steamy times. Im becoming a fan of the work of Lia Davis, she produces well defined storylines with characters that you can immediately take to and mainly believe in. She seems to get to the point of the story with no needless waffle Filling out more chapters than is actually needed to give you a story. The realism of the emotions the characters go through are done really well. You are able to feel the desperation, action, passion, secrets, lies, grief And suspense as you read along. The world building in this book is a world we live in ( apart from dragon shifters of course) and again easy to relate to. This is the third book I have read from this author and all of them have included steamy sex scenes, so if you are offended by this kind of storyline then this book isn\u2019t for you. However there are some great storylines in her books, this one is a strong independent woman, who knows her own mind, in desperate search of her missing sister. She won\u2019t allow to be treated as a weak willed female, she dives into the emotional draining search for her sister, then has to deal with the man she had an immediate connection to, and starting to fall in love with, admitting he is a dragon shifter. I recommend you read this book and find out how this storyline starts and finishes with fireworks at both ends and some simmering moments in between. I will definitely be looking forward to reading more of Lia Davis other books."}, {"userName": "Cali Jewel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19714462-cali-jewel", "userReview": "Could not get enough of this new dragon shifter world loving the Dark Scales Division.... emotionally thrilling, sexy, engaging, action packed romantic adventure filled with mystery, danger and red hot passion..... what more could a reader want?Owen Ashton is the sexy hot alpha of the DSD and is on the trail of a serial killer that murdered his sister.

Really enjoying dragon shifters with this one being special by being in a special unit that investigates is the bonus here. When Owen is in a case he also gets a bit of a surprise with whom he meets. Nadia is also going to have a surprise with her neighbor but the two of them together will need each other in more ways than one. The drama is swift and the story is quick over too soon. One thing is for sure I hope the next one that comes out of this series is longer to enjoy."}, {"userName": "Roseanna", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19168480-roseanna", "userReview": "This is the first in the Dark Scales Division series. I can see so many promising books in the future for this series. I have read Lia Davis\u2019s book before, so I knew it would be good. I was not disappointed. I haven't read Kerry Adrienne before, but I plan to check for other works. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. So much is happening, it just flies by, which is good but bad all at the same time. Some of the storyline was pretty predictable, enjoyable to read but still predictable. I wish there was a few curve balls thrown in, nothing too major, just to make you wonder and keep you guessing. Overall, its a solid story and I can't wait until there are more in the series."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754017-donna", "userReview": "What happens when you mix a shifter romance with a serial murder investigation? Read Dragon Undercover and find out. In my opinion dragon shifter and team lead for DSD\u2014Dark Scales Division\u2014Owen Ashton and his team should never have been on this case to start with. They were too close to it. But I guess it kept them motivated and it did allow Owen to meet his mate. Nadia is smart and responsible and stronger than she knows. This story is filled with love, loss, duty and determination. I look forward to getting better acquainted with the team. Fun action and romance."}, {"userName": "Tara Dorough", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43713786-tara-dorough", "userReview": "Dragon Undercover book one of Dark Scales Division by Lia Davis and Kerry Adrienne is wonderful. The characters are totally hot and sexy. The dragons are amazing. The first book is short but has everything you need for a new series. Kerry and Lia did a terrific job introducing their new series and characters. This new series features dragons that work for the Dragon Counsel protecting the world from rogue dragons. I can't wait to see where the series takes us. I received an ARC from Netgalley. This is my voluntary honest review."}, {"userName": "Patti", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54992320-patti", "userReview": "Overall rating: 4.5 (KU copy)This story sure read fast!
