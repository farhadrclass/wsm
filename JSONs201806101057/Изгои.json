(and i know catcher wasn't specifically produced for a teen audience, but it is on the damn syllabus and if it makes you happier, i will call this \"the teen in literature\" instead) in the fifties and sixties, there was seemingly more free-floating apprehension and fear: the a-bomb, the draft, various factors contributed to this fear of an imminent death beyond anyone's control. all this anxiety and fear of the establishment created a more pronounced sense of \"us\" and \"them\" that i think i blabbed on a little in the pigman review, but children were just treated like smaller adults, really. and the literature reflects this. all of these books seem to emphasize a value placed on the preservation of childhood innocence - staying gold, protecting a younger sister from the taint of phoniness, encouraging kids to act like kids and roller skate through the house and disregard the parental restrictions in this one safe place... now, the boundaries are blurrier - girls are getting their periods at 8, and grown men in suits are playing video games on the subway. the distinctions are less clear. and a lot of teen fiction today is more escapist in nature, less didactic. teens don't need to be told to value their childhood anymore because, don't worry, it will never end. peter pan FTW!!this all means nothing, except it is something i noticed. sorry for blabbing on..."}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold.***********The Outsiders is a book about sensitive teenage boys who alternately get into gang fights, hug one another, and burst into tears. They also spend more time than you might expect ruminating on how the tightness of a t-shirt might enhance the rippling musculature of a steely-eyed fellow gang member (this is where Stephanie Meyer got the idea for how to characterize Edward). Even though they're always complimenting each other's hair and doing gymnastics, it's not gay at all because it takes place in 1965, shortly after James Dean had made crying and homoerotic tension cool.This is the kind of book that teachers like to assign to 7th graders (or dumb high schoolers) because it offers up a lot of THEMES about how EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT BUT STILL THE SAME, and teachers feel pretty safe giving a quiz on that because even the stupidest kid can figure it out, as every few paragraphs the narrator will just go ahead and state it outright, like this: \"Even though we're Greasers and they're Socs, I guess in the end, we all look at the same sunset.\" (Sample essay question: What did Ponyboy mean when he said that everyone looked at the same sunset? And all you have to do to get it right is repeat the first half of the sentence.)As a narrator, Ponyboy kept reminding me of Holden Caulfied, if Holden was poor and actually managed to do anything interesting with his evenings. But maybe that just has to do with the time period and the fact that they both say stuff like \"I was just about bawling my eyes out, to tell you the truth\" every few pages, except Ponyboy is doing it because his best friend knifed someone and then died of a broken back and being on fire, and Holden is just sad because his roommate smells bad (oh and I guess his brother got cancer and died pffffft). I do think they would get along if they ever met, and maybe make out a little bit.I love the last few sentences of every chapter, where SE Hinton trots out her corniest stuff. Chapter 7: \"Socs were just guys after all. Things were rough all over, but it was better that way. That way you could tell the other guy was human too.\" Chapter 8: \"'Thanks, Ponyboy.' She smiled through her tears. 'You dig okay.' She had green eyes. I went on, walking home slowly.\" Oh and it doesn't come at the end of a chapter but: \"Not even the rattling of the train could keep me awake, and I went to sleep in a hoodlum's jacket, with a gun lying next to my hand.\" There's also the best deathbed speech in all of teen literature (probably), which goes like this: \"INTERPRETS THEMATICALLY RELEVANT POEM\" (DIES).So somehow I never read this in middle school, and when I read it now, I just end up giggling at half of the overwrought emotion (which happened with Catcher in the Rye too, but there I'm going to assume Salinger was writing on multiple levels, because he was a competent adult, whereas The Outsiders was written by someone Holden's age). But it's still a pretty awesome book.EDITED to add that this Penguin edition makes the book seem really classy, which is nice, but Jodi Picoult's introduction is kind of a joke. She basically asked her 14-year-old son to write a book report and quoted excerpts.Facebook 30 Day Book Challenge Day 6: Favorite young adult book."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I have watched this movie over and over when I was younger and I still have it today and love it just as much. I will admit I was in love with Dallas and had a crush on Sodapop but Dallas was my man =)I just can't believe it took me this many years to read the book! And the book was so close to the movie it is almost unreal. Maybe it was due to the fact that S.E. Hinton was on set helping with the movie, I really don't know. I just love that I can read a book and watch a movie and there not be that many things different. Ok, there will be . . . . This is a remarkable story of people from different sides of the tracks. The greasers (the poor boys and some girls) and the socs (the rich kids)This story is told from the greasers side which is awesome because I really don't care about the socs! These boys all looked out for each other in the best ways they could. Even if they were dirt poor, they did what they could for each other. They had fun times getting in rumbles with the socs, most all of them loved to fight. It was like getting set loose in a candy store. Most of the beginning of the story revolves around Ponyboy and Johnny. They are the best of friends and poor Johnny seems to have it bad no matter which way he turns. His parents treat him bad, he sleeps outside most of the time and he got a very bad beating from the socs. That's what they do, cruise around and find a greaser or two alone and gang up on them. They damn near beat Johnny to death and all of the other friends always rally around him and try to protect him from things. Until one tragic night Ponyboy and Johnny get attacked by a group of socs AGAIN, but this time Johnny stabs and kills the jerk that beat him so bad before. They were trying to drown Ponyboy. They have to run to Dallas to help get them out of town. Because that's what friends do, they hang out and help each other if they are in trouble. Dallas tells Ponyboy and Johnny to hop on this train and go to a town and stay in an abandoned church until things die down and he would come up there. He gives them money and a gun. Johnny buys them food and hair dye for Ponyboy (which he hates) and he also gets \"Gone With The Wind\" for Ponyboy because he has always wanted to read it. I thought that was so nice of him and he picked a really great book. Ponyboy spent time reading the book to his friend when they weren't playing cards to pass the time. At one point Dallas shows up and tells them some things and takes them out to eat. The boys decide they are going to turn themselves in but when they get back to the church, it's on fire and there are a couple of people and a bunch of children huddled around it. When the boys get there they find out some of the kids are inside and Ponyboy and Johnny (being the good guys that they are) go in after them. Of course Dallas is yelling for them to get back out! Needless to say they get the kids to safety but Dallas and Ponyboy get a little hurt in the process. Johnny gets messed up bad. It's always Johnny! He always just wanted to be normal for shite's sake! The people thought they were heroes which is truly what they were. \"We think the towheaded kid is going to be all right. He burned one arm pretty badly, though, trying to drag the other kid out the window. Johnny, well I don't know about him. A piece of timber caught him across the back--he might have a broken back, and he was burned pretty severely. He passed out before he got out the window. They're giving him plasma now.\" He must have seen the look on my face because he hurriedly changed the subject. \"I swear, you three are the bravest kids I've seen in a long time. First you and the black-haired kid climbing in that window, and then the tough-looking kid going back to save him. Mrs. O'Briant and I think you were sent straight from heaven. Or are you just professional heroes or something?\"Sent from heaven? Had he gotten a good look at Dallas? \"No, we're greasers,\" I said. I was too worried and scared to appreciate the fact that he was trying to be funny.Johnny isn't doing so well in the hospital and Dallas and Ponyboy are really afraid for him. Dallas breaks out of the hospital on the night of the rumble to fight for Johnny. He was so happy after the fight that he grabbed Ponyboy and rushed back to the hospital to tell Johnny they had won. Even though, they didn't know it at the time, they got to spend the last few minutes with Johnny before he died. It was so sad, I cried a river. I knew what was going to happen but it doesn't matter, I cried the river. Dallas goes nuts of course and runs off. Ponyboy is in a daze when he gets home and tells everyone that Johnny is dead and that Dallas ran off. They are all sad of course and worried what Dallas is going to do. And then they get the call that Dallas robbed a store and the police are after him so they go to meet up with him. But when they get to him the stupid cops killed him. And I think he wanted that really because he pulled an unloaded gun on them. Maybe it's just my thoughts but I feel like he called the guys because he did want to live in a way but he was so messed up with Johnny dying after all that poor kid had been through, that he wanted to die himself. Of course I cried and cried at that as well. So, Ponyboy is trying to cope with two of his friends dying in one night. He doesn't do very well and is sick for quite some time. This book really made me have some feels. Like I said before I have watched the movie a million times but as an adult, reading the book put more things into perspective. This is the second book that I have read lately that has made me want to change some things in my life. At least some of the things that I can and that is one of the many things I love about reading. \u2665MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "Finally read this classic. Glad to be in the know!I can see why this has stood the test of time. The story is easy to get into and keeps your attention throughout. It seems like any person, young or old, rich or poor, popular or outcast could empathize or sympathize the themes. Finally, the key climax points are done very well and hit you right in the feels!Another thought I had while reading is this is another one of the young adult fore fathers. We now take for granted that every week there will be 10 new YA titles to pique our interest. Back when this came out, the YA gems were few and far between.

We had a discussion about it in class today, and I had to write this as soon it was over. I wish there were more stars to give The Outsiders, but five will have to do. I love this book, and have loved it faithfully since I read it in sixth grade - I must have read it a dozen times, and possibly more. I can quote long sections of the book. I was obsessed, and to some degree still am. It's not a good book by any literary standard, really. Hinton uses one of those usually awful formulaic introductions that devotes a paragraph to each main character, explicitly describing their characteristics, history, and appearance. When I think of it objectively, it's almost as bad as that awful, awful introductory second chapter of the Babysitters Club books that repeats in every installment. I think the point is, though, that I just don't care. In fact, I adore the writing even though it is obvious. Maybe because I first read it when I was eleven and that sort of writing just seemed clear and to-the-point. At any rate, I don't think it suffers too badly from the style, and if anything it benefits from the authenticity of a teenage author. I can't even begin to say what it was about this book that caught my interest and imagination so completely. I liked the otherness of it - I had never experienced anything like these boys dealt with. Not the pervasive fear and violence, not the absentee, non-existent, or abusive parents, and definitely not the fascinating siege-mentality camaraderie that existed in their group. The best part of the book, without any doubt, is the characters she has created. I love them all, with the exception of Steve. They are wonderful and so sympathetic, with their odd names and ill-fated lives. I hope for the ending to change every time I read it. Ponyboy's voice, which narrates the story, has a beautiful vulnerability and honesty that makes the story believable. He's often confused, hurt, scared, sorry, and just feels like things are wrong; but, he's also brave and kind and takes chances on people. I think that Hinton's allowing her main character to be a real person, who is more often than not unsure of everything he does, gives the book its credibility with teenagers. Fantastic, must-read, childhood-defining book. Reading Hinton's \"That Was Then, This is Now\" is worth it just for the few brief cameos a slightly older Ponyboy makes throughout the story."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762033-maureen", "userReview": "I'm just feeling a lot of emotions right now don't toUCH ME.I barely remembered anything about this book from reading it in high school but oh man it was definitely better than I remember.

So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day.Nothing gold can stay.\u201d \nLast week my son came home from school and informed me he had a homework assignment about the book his class is reading as a group. Said child was forlorn that he would be unable to complete the assignment as the editions of the book were for \u201cclass use only\u201d and were not permitted to be taken home. \u201cNever you fear,\u201d I said to the young boy, \u201cfor I have a LIBRARY CARD!!!!!!\u201d (while actually freaking out that I might have to: (i) change out of my \u201ccomfy\u201d clothes, (ii) move my slothlike self off of the sofa after a hard day at work, or (iii) embarrass the child by refusing to change out of P.J. pants whilst chauffeuring him to pick up a hard copy of the book). I asked the small boy (with much trepidation) \u201cwhat book do you need?\u201d and he answered \u201cThe Outsiders.\u201d I was filled with glee and assured my son I could easily help him with any questions about that book as I read it a bunch of times myself 800 years ago when I was a young girl. The boy was dubious, so in order to ease his mind I searched the interwebs and was thrilled to find out The Outsiders was available in Kindle format from the library. Whilst waiting for the book to load on to the Kindle, I turned to my son and said the following words:\n \u201cWhen I stepped out into the bright sunlight, from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home . . .\u201d\nFollowed by: \u201cBLAM! TAKE THAT SUCKA! STILL WANT TO TANGLE WITH THE MEMORY OF THIS OLD LADY? YEAH, I DIDN\u2019T THINK SO, NOW WHAT\u2019S YOUR QUESTION?\u201dThe boy was able to pick my geriatric brain for assistance with his homework and it turned out the book wasn\u2019t really a requirement in order to get the assignment done in the first place. (Note to all of you youngsters who do not yet have children of you own \u2013 THEY ARE WILEY MOFOS AND EVEN THE MOST HONOR-ROLL-A-RIFIC KID WILL AT SOME POINT GO TO ANY AND ALL LENGTHS TO AVOID HOMEWORK.) Thus, I found myself left with The Outsiders on the Kindle and it was seriously begging me to put down the crappy book I was currently reading and take a trip down memory lane. So that\u2019s just what I did . . . \nIt was just as good as I remembered it. The Outsiders is the quintessential teenage story about love and loss and family and right and wrong and good and bad. I read it in an evening, sitting outside during a sunset, as one should do if given the opportunity. It proved to be timeless, it still made me teary-eyed after all these years, and I still thought it had one of the best ensemble cast of characters ever put to paper. \nAnd then I remembered it was written by a teenager - one of those awful things that lives in my house and makes my hair turn gray. So let me wrap up this non-review kind of review with a personal note: To my son, I ask you to recognize everything I do for you is with love, just like Darry Curtis and Ponyboy, and I promise I will do everything in my power to make you \u201cstay gold\u201d as long as possible."}, {"userName": "Mayra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1967563-mayra", "userReview": "Expectations scare me.

While there are plenty of quirks that set this story apart from the similar coming-of-age dramas, I will write about a few that remain fresh in my memory exactly two months after I read the book. \u2705 The unconventional names. Sodapop and Ponyboy aren't usually the kind of names that you go about hearing everyday in your life. Well, Peter and John aren't, either; for I come from another culture, but something about these names tells me that I will keep associating them with The Outsiders as long as nature decides not to eat up my brain, more than I will ever relate Charlie to The Perks of Being a Wallflower. These names certainly have burnt the name of the book into the history of young-adult classics for eternity. \u2705 The class divide. The rural-urban, poor-rich, havenots-haves, greasers-sops divide has formed the crux of countless number of stories that men had made up ever since they started witnessing them plague their real lives too, but The Outsiders explores the world of the teenagers who have come into the first touch of harsh reality where they have to fend for themselves and do anything to survive the vile, vile world; even if it includes killing people. Only, they are not a bunch of savages running around flashing knives and brandishing weapons with a barbaric glint in their eyes-- but real nice kids who would just go to school and try to make it big in their lives if only they had the right avenues opening up before them. \u2705 The devil-may-care attitude. You see two of your friends die right in front of your eyes. Not likely to happen in our always-calm-and-no-storm lives. However it isn't hard to imagine that this might be a everyday happening elsewhere. Kids get into bloody street fights, brawls and get killed- all because that is what they think life is all about and there is no one to lead them out of this vicious circle of life. The cool and detached way Hinton describes the struggles that the Greasers have to face to get through everyday and how they regard friendship as their highest ideal and how the supposedly tough and steel-hearted Dally gave up his life to uphold his virtue sent chills up my spine. And it reminded me why this extraordinary story of a seemingly simple, unexciting and ordinary bunch of street kids has carved a niche for itself in the annals of the 20th century literary history.\u2705 Lastly, the image of Patrick Swayze and Tom Cruise popping up in my head at the mention of Darry and Steve. Am I mistaken?

Probably not, but she was affected by what she saw in her 1965 Oklahoma high school; the presence of two rival gangs, the Greasers and the Socs.

They are in constant feud with the \"socialite\" rich kids, or soc's for short. The very first thing I want to mention about The Outsiders is that S.E. Hinton was only a 16-year-old high school student when she authored it. She was inspired to write about teenagers in a way that represented them accurately because she felt as though there weren't many books doing that. Knowing this particular fact really impressed me, because I would be proud to have published something like this in my 30's or 40's, let alone at 16. This novel's strongest quality is the perspective of its main character, Ponyboy Curtis. He is 14, the baby of the group, and it becomes clear almost immediately that he struggles to fit into the rigid expectations of his caste. Ponyboy is steadfastly loyal to his gang, shows up for his side in a rumble, and claims the title \"greaser\" with an air of pride. However, he goes against the grain by being academically oriented & malleable in his attitude toward life. The honesty in his narrative voice gives us an adulterated look at how he wavers back & forth between praising & condemning the division of social classes. For him, the allegiance of the greasers is far superior, even akin to brotherhood, while the order of the soc's is based on selfishness & dominance. But Pony is not ignorant to the trouble that comes with being poor in his town, and multiple times he expresses grief over inevitability of his friends' futures. Hinton uses this short tale to make some powerful statements about importance of family, the potency of friendship, and the haste with which all of that can be taken away from you. The poison of branding individuals by their social standing, the struggling combatting the taboo of leaving a small town in search of personal success. These concepts are handled with an insightful intelligence for a writer so young. Hinton actually ends up exemplifying the point of her novel with her own accomplishment of penning The Outsiders so early on in her life. The older we get, the easier it is to underestimate how much young people truly know. For me though, this is a book I am glad I will never have to read again. It is very well-written, and shockingly sad in many places over only a handful of pages. I can appreciate its existence & understand the critical representation it provided for the era. But I didn't enjoy it the way I've enjoyed other classics. I won't necessarily think back fondly on the experience of reading it, nor will I have the urge to rave & recommend it to my bookish friends. It's a book I am glad to read for the context it provides & because it's a voice that deserves to be heard.Thanks to Celeste for buddy reading this with me even though I was an abysmal reading partner & accidentally spoiled you for a big twist in the book! *shovels dirt onto her own grave*"}, {"userName": "Celeste", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste", "userReview": "Full review now posted!Wow, this was an incredibly powerful book. And it was made more powerful (for me) by the knowledge that the author was only 16 when she penned it. The story of Ponyboy, his brothers, and their gang of greaser friends was profoundly emotional. The violence between opposing gangs, and the lack of adult knowledge or interference, seemed so sad and pointless, but adolescent rage with no direction or purpose has to exert itself in some way. These boys just wanted to survive, and to possibly find happiness in the process, but life is so very against them.All of the greasers, even those who weren\u2019t present quite as often, were very well developed. Each of them were unique individuals, despite being members of a gang that sprang from the pen of a teenager. However, my two favorites were Ponyboy, our main character, and Johnny. These two were a little more obviously sensitive than the rest of their group, and the other boys fought desperately to preserve this innocence that they themselves had already lost. This protectiveness was sweet and heartbreaking and seemingly futile in the face of poverty and gang wars and other symptoms of having to living in such a broken world.But even in the midst of such tragedy, there is always hope. Sunsets and chocolate cake for breakfast and brothers who would give you the shirt off their backs if it would make you smile all proclaim this hope. Good friends and track meets and laughter and Gone with the Wind all make life worth living, even when it hurts. This is another book that I wish I had found when I was a teenager, but better late than never, right? Hinton wrote the story she needed, one of teens portrayed as they really are, in all their angry, laughing glory. This was a tale of hardship and how unfair life can be and the resilience of adolescents. It was sad and moving and life-affirming. If you haven\u2019t read it, please do so. And if you know a teen that is raging against the hand they\u2019ve been dealt, try to get a copy of this into their hands.A buddy read with the lovely Mary!For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings."}, {"userName": "Grace (BURTSBOOKS)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63164992-grace-burtsbooks", "userReview": "The Outsiders is not only a classic but one of my favourite books of all time, and I do not in anyway feel worthy enough to be reviewing it, but here we are. I\u2019m not going to give a synopsis because I\u2019m sure everyone already knows what this book is about but let me just say, I love this book so much; it broke my heart and I can\u2019t believe I waited so long to read it. My family had been bugging me to read this since my 11th birthday, and I finally caved this year and let me tell you, I wasn\u2019t disappointed in the slightest. I don\u2019t give out 5-star ratings often and it takes a lot for a book to make me want to give it a perfect score but, to me, this book is perfection. The ideas and themes, the overall story and most importantly the characters. Every character in this book is so well written and well realized, not to mention relatable and loveable. Reading about this group of friends, or more appropriately brothers, was beautiful and as I said earlier, heartbreaking. I love Dally Winston with all my heart, and after Adam Parrish, he is my favourite character, probably ever. I think (and cry) about him all the time. If you\u2019re like me and for whatever reason, you\u2019ve been putting reading this off, stop! Read it!

Ponyboy Curtis is a greaser, he wears his hair long, filled with hair oil, walks with a slouch to look \"tuff\", and will stand up and defend the group of guys he has grown up with to the bitter end. Despite all of this Ponyboy isn't a real greaser, he is a dreamer who gets good grades, and wonders about the world, and wants better things for himself and those around him. This is the story of a group of \"brothers\" who have to deal with the social injustices of being considered hoodlums, society thinks this is what they are; therefore, that is what they have become. This is a heartbreaking story about a friendship, societal injustices, prejudices, social classes, and above all else the bond of brotherhood.

When I got the book, I put on a happy face and said I as excited to read it. But honestly I did not want to read a book about boys in a bad part of town and about street fights. But my aunt kept asking me if I read it, and after a few months I picked up the book, and from there, I couldn't put it down. This book was so inspirational and great. I loved every one of the characters. My favorite characters were definitely Johnny and Dallas though. If you are ever hesitant about reading this book, don't second guess it like I did. The story is so real. Things happen, people die. When you read this book, you leave your living room, and you end up in a different, scary world. You read a story that people like you are actually living. And that's the scary part. I cried in this book, laughed a few times, were amused by the characters, and hated some too. This book is not my style, but I thank my aunt for introducing me to this book, that I would never dare try on my own. This book is fantastic and I have nothing but great words to say.

Revisiting the story as an adult, I was immediately comforted by Ponyboy's familiar narrative but newly and deeply affected by his innocence and gentleness. Tough guys who speak affectionately and with sweetness to one another is of a different era but the coming of age tale of boys who want to be men but are still just boys is quite timeless, as are the other themes in the story. As a parent, I felt most for Darry and Dallas this time around, characters I'm sure I barely considered when reading this as a teenager. I wanted to save them all. This story is so sad.An epic achievement by a teen author back in the sixties.
