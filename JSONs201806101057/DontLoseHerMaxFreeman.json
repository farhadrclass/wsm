It had some action and I stayed worried about the fact they kidnapped an eight month pregnant woman. And I liked that you got three perspectives, the kidnapper, the person kidnapped and the private investigator friend who was looking for her. I still don't understand why they moved her from the warehouse to the Everglades as that part isn't said. It was pretty much a fast paced book and somewhat entertaining.

Diane\u2019s lawyer husband, Billy, privately employs the talents of his close friend and former police officer turned private detective, Max Freeman, to help find out any info that he can, by any means necessary, legal or otherwise, that the police and detectives on the case might not be able to figure out. The race is on to find out who kidnapped Diane, why they kidnapped her, and hopefully find her and the unborn baby alive.At 262 pages and told from three separate perspectives, this book takes you through a lot and the flow is seamless, riveting and original. DON\u201dT LOSE HER is not a overly complex story, but it is a very well told story. Author Jonathan King has won me over with this book. This is the 7th book in the Max Freeman, but having never read any of the others; I was never lost or confused as to what was going on. Max is an interesting character. He\u2019s a \u201cgood guy\u201d per se, but never turns his nose up at bending the rules and sometimes out right breaking the law to get to the bottom of a case. Max has made endless connections over the years, and those connections aren\u2019t always on the side of the law that Max is.Diane is a strong willed and determined character; exactly as she should be with being a judge. Despite her desperate situation, she never gives up and slowly works her courtroom magic on her captors. Through being a judge for several years, she has dealt with every criminal imaginable so in her hostage situation, she is more cognizant than most would be to any possible detail that might help free her, or help out those who are looking for her by leaving them clues. Not only that, but the maternal instincts that come with being 8 months pregnant, make her an even more determined character that we can sympathize with. There\u2019s never a dull moment in DON\u2019T LOSE HER; fans of the crime/thriller genre will greatly enjoy this book and it\u2019s certainly made me want to seek out the other Max Freeman novels. I hated for this book to end and that is rare; usually at the end of a book I am ready to be done and move onto the next and most of the time it isn\u2019t because it\u2019s bad at all, I\u2019m just simply ready to start a new adventure with new characters. I would have been completely content with going on for another 200 pages. I give this one 4.5/5!"}, {"userName": "Tracyk", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4821590-tracyk", "userReview": "Don't Lose Her is the 7th Max Freeman mystery, but the first I have read. I was surprised I liked it so much, given that it really isn't the type of mystery I would normally choose. It tends toward the thrillerish and has a bit more action than I go for.US district judge Diane Manchester is eight months pregnant and presiding over the extraditon trial of a Colombian drug lord. Before she calls recess for lunch, he taunts her, almost implying that she will suffer if the verdict doesn't go his way. When she takes a break for lunch, she is abducted, quickly and efficiently.Unfortunately for her captors, Max Freeman, South Florida private investigator, is employed by her husband, Billy Manchester, a litigator with connections in law enforcement agencies and beyond. Max and Billy are very good friends, and Max is ready to do anything necessary to find her and her abductors. They are not sure if members of the drug cartel are responsible. A judge can have many enemies.The story was told from different viewpoints and that is well done. Max tells of his investigation in first person narrative, but we also get the perspective of one of the kidnapping crew and the victim herself. All three of these add an emotional component. Max is very concerned about Diane and knows how his friend Billy is suffering; Diane is primarily concerned about her unborn baby and how she will be treated.Jonathon King's books are set in South Florida. This one starts out in West Palm Beach, Florida, and ends up in the Everglades. Fortunately Max knows the Everglades well. I liked that the ending was realistic, not over the top. Some events at the end were a tad predictable, but I enjoyed the journey. I intend to try more Max Freeman novels, and especially the first one, The Blue Edge of Midnight, which won the Edgar for best first novel. However, I had no problem getting into this seventh entry in the series without having read previous books. It can easily stand alone.I was provided a copy by the publisher for review via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Anne  (Booklady) Molinarolo", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3615945-anne-booklady-molinarolo", "userReview": "4.5 StarsFinally! I patiently awaited this 7th installment of Jonathon King\"s Max Freeman Series with great anticipation. And with good reason, my cynical loner Max is back! King really built the suspense in Don't Lose Her and never let up until the very last word. The Epitaph indicates the story line might not be finished. I love it! Hopefully the 8th in the series is being written as I write this review. Billy Manchester becomes more human too, willing to break the rules like Max. After all it is his wife and unborn child's life at stake. Federal Judge Diane Manchester is hearing an extradition case involving the worst drug lord Columbia and the US have seen in a while. Soon after the defendant made a veiled threat toward her and her baby in court, Manchester is literally grabbed up from the Palm Beach street while she's walking to a cafe for lunch. Max answers Billy's call to find and rescue Diane. But things are never as they seem, aren't they? The Drug Cartel may not have kidnapped Diane. If it wasn't the cartel, then who and why? Armed with 100K of walking money, Max follows leads throughout Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties. Eventually the trail leads him to the Everglades, and like Diane Manchester says while looking out of a window,\"You're screwed. Max knows the Glades and you'll get hurt.\" But will Freeman get to Diane in time? The FIB's are always right behind him and are constantly demanding that Freeman be debriefed.I loved the way King moved the story line by several POVs - Diane's,. a kidnapper's, Billy's, and Max's.

This allows insight into the inner workings of the kidnapping - and the attempted rescue.The judge, even though incapacitated by her pregnancy, is still a strong female protagonist. And Max is going to get the job done - no matter what.There was some interesting descriptive passages about the Florida Everglades and Florida in general.The author is very good at describing scenes and making the reader feel like they're right in the middle of the action.

Max Freeman is a brilliant private investigator and the real star of the show. Diane, eight months pregnant and Federal judge, plays the perfect hostage. We feel empathy toward her but also cheer for her at the same time. And even the abductors are written so well, we can't help but feel sorry for them.The other thing that worked really well was the location - I have never been to the Florida Everglades but I sure felt like I had by the time I finished this book. Great descriptions of the area and really brought the area to life in my mind.The biggest negative to me was the actual investigation itself. I have read more than my fair share of mystery/thriller novels and this one just really didn't have either of those things. We kinda know who the abductors are early on (so no real mystery) and the story was pretty slow. One of the biggest issues I had was the different POV's and the changes in tense. Told from 3 characters - some in present tense, some in past - this just never really had a chance to build real tension. And that is disappointing as it had all the hallmarks of being a cracking novel.Overall, not a bad book - just one that fell down a little with execution (in my mind, at least) - but you should be the judge of that!PaulARH"}, {"userName": "Grace Koshida", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7033015-grace-koshida", "userReview": "US district judge Diane Manchester presides over the extradition hearing of a notorious Colombian drug lord Escalante.

(Goodreads)Review:This is a well written suspenseful, action packed mystery thriller. When a very pregnant US district judge is kidnapped walking down the street, someone is in big trouble. The kidnapper made a big mistake when he abducted Diane. He must not have realized who he was abducting and what means would be used to return her and her baby back safely. They must not have known that Max Freeman would be pursuing them. They will find out what a critical error they made because Max will not rest until Diane and the baby are found and returned.The characters are well developed and well rounded. Diane is a take charge no nonsense woman who does not fold under pressure. She will use all of her smarts and years of experience dealing with criminals to help her get out of the situation she finds herself in. Max, a retired policeman and current private investigator, is tenacious and tireless when he is working on a case. And this case is even more personal to him because of his friendship with Diane and her husband. The writing style flows smoothly and the book is an easy read. It is written in three different points of view: Diane, Max and the kidnappers. This made the book unique, in my opinion, and I thought it made the book even better. The author is very talented creating suspense and tension with the written word and I found myself reading well after I should have turned off the light and gone to sleep.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted mystery suspense. I have not read any other book by this author, but after reading Don\u2019t Lose Her, I will be getting more books to read and enjoy. I would suggest you do the same.I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

And the story is weak, in my opinion.The main character, Max Freeman, and most of the secondary characters are strong and well developed. Max is a likable guy, smart and loyal to his friends. One of his friends is Diane Manchester, the kidnapped judge. Diane and her husband, Billy, are expecting a baby. Billy is a brilliant lawyer and financial planner for some of the most powerful people in this country and others, and he\u2019s Max\u2019s best friend and employer. Billy is black and Diane is white. I\u2019m sure the backstory of this wonderful bi-racial couple in a previous book in the series is a great read; I liked them both. And I liked Sherry, Max\u2019s girlfriend who lost her right leg in a previous book, but has never lost her drive as a detective with the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office and more importantly, she has never lost the love and devotion of Max. They are a great group.Now I\u2019ll tell you what I didn\u2019t like. Everything else! The middle half or so of this book was so boring that I kept falling asleep. Honestly, I have given 5 star reviews to books that weren\u2019t nearly as well written and constructed as this one because I was still wide awake at 4 in the morning, flipping pages as fast as I could read them because the story was just that compelling. Not this one. I stopped reading completely several times and dreaded getting back to it. Why? It was obvious to me from very early in the book that they were following the wrong leads. As a lover of mysteries, I have always tried to figure them out before the end of the book\u2026sometimes successfully, sometimes not. This one was so easy to figure out that the surprise ending, the twist, wasn\u2019t a surprise at all. Bummer. Just a long drawn out series of knowing they were on the wrong path and waiting endlessly for them to catch up with me. And, while I normally love books that give multiple points of view, the view point of the kidnapper elicited no sympathetic reaction from me, and while I should have been interested in Diane\u2019s point of view, she got boring, too. Even Max, who I liked a lot, got boring with his constant reminders that \u201creal life\u201d cases aren\u2019t solved as quickly as television or movies.If you are a reader who can enjoy a book on the strength of writing skills, you might really like this one. There are some beautiful passages about the landscape and skies of southern Florida that would be worthy of the best travelogues. However, if it takes a well constructed mystery to keep your attention, you might want to skip this one. It fell short for me\u2026into drudgery."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5506829-heather", "userReview": "The people who kidnapped pregnant Diane aren\u2019t overly cruel\u2013as long as she keeps her hood on and does what they want her to do, they leave her largely alone. However, the rule is that none of the kidnappers can speak within her hearing. There\u2019s one particular person, Rae, who has babysitting duties. Rae is independent, annoyed by having to take care of this woman (also annoyed with Diane\u2019s perceived \u2018whininess\u2019)\u2013yet at the same time, she does what she needs to in order to care for Diane and her baby. Rae is one of the point of view characters, which gives a very interesting view on the bad guys and what\u2019s happening with Diane. This contrasts nicely with Max\u2019s efforts, conclusions, and assumptions. It gives everyone a deeper level of characterization than there would otherwise be.The real problem\u2013for Max and Billy and, in a lesser way, us as readers\u2013is that there\u2019s no hint of a motive for the kidnapping. There are no ransom demands. Diane\u2019s jailers don\u2019t even speak to her, so they certainly aren\u2019t making threats. On the one hand, this draws out the mystery, which is usually a good thing. Usually mysteries get drawn out, however, by providing multiple possible motives, enemies, or outcomes. In this case we had virtually nothing. There was a tiny incident partway through that, if you\u2019re paying attention, you\u2019ll realize indicates who\u2019s actually behind everything. Not because there\u2019s any real in-plot reason to think he\u2019s done it, but simply because plot structure demands it.Ideally when reading a mystery you get small hints and red herrings. It builds up until you start guessing what\u2019s going on, and once you find out, you\u2019re hopefully left smacking your forehead and calling yourself an idiot for not seeing it sooner. In this case however, there\u2019s nothing for you to see. There\u2019s no sense later of having figured something cool out. We weren\u2019t kept in mystery by delightful sleight-of-hand; we were kept in mystery by a simple lack of any knowledge. It\u2019s much less satisfying.Thus, the characters were interesting, the setup was neat, and I enjoyed the milieu. But the author left us hanging with no sense of progress throughout most of the book.NOTE: Review ebook provided free by publisher via NetGalley.For a longer review including premise, visit Errant Dreams: http://www.errantdreams.com/2015/05/r..."}, {"userName": "Diane Coto", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15367113-diane-coto", "userReview": "If you want an abundance of attention really quickly, abduct a Federal Judge \u2026 better yet, abduct one who is eight months pregnant.

If she shows a single sign of weakness, Diane risks jeopardizing the biggest trial of her career and setting a vicious murderer free.In seconds, her situation takes a harrowing turn for the worse.

Complicating matters is that Diane is age forty-three and eight months pregnant with her first child.Max Freeman, private investigator, and former Philadelphia cop, works for Diane's husband, Billy, a black lawyer from Philadelphia who prefers to remain behind the scenes, juggling law and investment work.No words are uttered by Diane's abductors. Her head is covered and she can't see the people who are holding her captive.Officials are perplexed because there is no follow-up ransom demand. Since Diane was working on the case of the Columbian drug lord, Max speculates that it might have a connection with that.With funds and input from Billy, Max looks into Diane's prior cases. Billy gives Max the details of the most likely cases where Diane sent a person to prison and now that person's sentence is over and they might be free from prison and want a revenge kidnapping.The premise of the story is sound but Diane isn't permitted to talk to the people who abducted her, and they don't talk to one another in her presence. Author Jonathan King fails to create a sympathetic character. Even though Diane is eight months pregnant and worried about her child, the reader will find it difficult to relate or sympathise with her or her wealthy husband.One minor character, one of Diane's abductors, is a young woman and she feel remorse for abducting Diane.This character is sympathetic as we share her thoughts as Diane attempts to communicate with her about the baby.The middle section of the story was slow and the conclusion was a surprise, perhaps too much so without sufficient foreshadowing. I enjoy the work of Jonathan King and will look forward to his next novel."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383239-autumn", "userReview": "I received this book via NetGalley.I have never read anything by this author so when I was offered the chance I jumped on it. the blurb sounded pretty good. Now when I noticed that it was book seven I was kind of worried that I wouldn't have a clue who the characters are as we all know previous characters normally always come back to play in a series.This was not the case. I jumped right into the story and I truly enjoyed it. Diane is a judge on a huge case when she goes out to lunch she is kidnapped! Oh boy right to make it even more exciting she is pregnant 8 months to be exact. Her husband calls in a friend that friend being Max Freeman to help find her. Max doesn't work for the police or the FBI so he has his own way of finding out things on the streets. He enlist the help of some people he knows to find Diane before it is too late. No one knows what will happen to her and the baby as no one know who has taken her or why. This story is told in three different P.O.V.'s and it is not at all confusing. You have Max's point of view and what he is doing to help find Diane. You have Diane's point of view and what she is feeling, seeing, hearing pretty much what she is going through in this ordeal. And then you have the kidnappers point of view. They don't really talk as they have been ordered not to, but there is one kidnapper who starts thinking this was a bad idea once she learns who Diane is.I didn't even know who the culprit was until the end and I was like WHAT!!! The author has a good way of describing things going on and I thought that was good. This was the first book I have read from this author and I do plan on reading more if they are this good."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/955320-rhonda", "userReview": "4 STARSThis is the 7th book in the Max Freeman series. It is the first one that I have read. To me it stands alone okay.The suspense is good. I did not know what was the reason for the kidnapping or wither the judge would be rescued in time.I liked Max and how he was willing to do what ever he needed to find his friend and rescue the judge. Max Freeman is a PI Detective who works for Billie. Diane is a federal judge hearing a case about a drug dealer who wants to be sent back to his country instead of being tried under the Rico law. Diane is eight months pregnant. She is white with ties in Florida high society.Billie is a lawyer and works out of his home. He is a black lawyer with money and ties around the world. He has a stutter if he is facing anyone. He is smart. He is honest but not afraid to break some laws to find some leads to his wife.Diane is walking down the street going for lunch when a white van pulls up to her and pulls her into the van. She has no idea who kidnapped her and why. She has a bag over her head and no one talks to her.Diane is smart and keeps trying to figure things out. Too leave finger prints where she can. Tries to developa bond with her kidnapper.The setting is Florida modern day.I wanted more to the book. Was not ready to put the book down. I would read another book by Jonathon King in the future.

This newest entry did nothing to change that.King brings the Everglades alive, making the reader feel as if he\u2019s there, in a few well-crafted sentences. And he moves Max\u2019s relationship with Sherry forward a few steps, a much more realistic approach than many authors use.The tension is steady throughout with just enough downtime sections to give the reader a chance to catch his breath.The reason for kidnapping Max\u2019s friend\u2019s wife, Diane, was a bit of a surprise but I suspected who was behind it the moment he appeared in the book.The first four chapters are in present tense, the rest in past. When King made the shift from present tense in Chapter 5, it threw me.Two key characters in the story seem to get short shrift at the end, disappearing after the climax. It would have been nice to know what happened to them. The epilog seemed a little vague and thus unnecessary \u2013 unless King is using it as a lead-in to an upcoming book in the series.One mistake jumped out at me. King has Freeman driving a restored one-time Plymouth police car with a 420 cu. in. engine. Those cars had 440 cu. in. engines.I still like these Max Freeman novels and hope King writes more of them."}, {"userName": "Marjorie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30147296-marjorie", "userReview": "Given To Me To For An Honest ReviewDon't Lose Her by Jonathon King is a must read. This book will grab you as soon as you open it and will hold you down on the edge of your seat as you watch the pages turn and turn and turn some more until the last page. It is action packed and make sure you have some tissue because it is very emotional. You may even shed a tear or two. There is great plot development with a surprise twist at the end that you don't see coming. A federal judge is eight months pregnant. She is hearing the trial of a notorious Colombian drug lord. During the lunch break she is kidnapped. Max Freeman, PI, a friend of her husband Billy, begins to search for her. This story is told in three perspectives: Max, the judge and the kidnapper. Why was the judge kidnapped? Who kidnapped her. Will she be found? When you get to the last page you'll find out who and what was behind this awful crime. I gave this book 5 stars but wish I could give it more. It would be a great addition to your bookshelf. Because of some of the language I would recommend this for 18+.

Private Investigator Max Freeman is called in to investigate the kidnapping of the wife of his best friend, a federal judge who is 8 months pregnant. King head hops from the judge's POV, to Freeman's to the kidnapper's to give the reader a good understanding of what is happening and to allow us to develop sympathy for all who are involved.King moves the plot along, and it was hard for me to put the book down. I especially enjoyed the setting in the Florida Everglades. Yet, I found the rationale for the kidnapping to be kind of silly, and Freeman largely was a reduced to the role of gofer while his friend Billy, husband of the kidnapped victim, is the one who does the heavy lifting in terms of solving the identify and motive of the people behind the kidnapping-- and he pretty much does it off scene, presenting his conclusions to Freeman as fait accompli.I don't know that I would read another book in this series, but it was a pleasant enough diversion for an afternoon."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/593392-carolyn", "userReview": "Don't Lose Her is suspenseful and well written. I had never read anything by Jonathon King before and didn't realize this title is number 7 in the Max Freeman series. It stood up well as a stand alone, but I plan to go back and read some of the earlier books, now that I've been introduced to the characters.Max is a private investigator in South Florida. He often works for Billy, a super rich lawyer and computer expert. Diane, Billy's wife, is a Federal Judge presiding over the trial of a Colombian drug lord.Diane is grabbed from a busy city street during her lunch hour. Her assailants blindfold her and maintain total silence. She has no idea who her captors are, what they want, or even if her guards are male or female. The story is told from three viewpoints: Max Freeman, Diane, and her female guard. Diane is eight months pregnant, a little old to be having a first pregnancy, and desperately afraid for her life and the life of her child. The female guard, in many ways a victim, as well, is a girl who has never had a chance for a decent life.

Oblivious to anything else I read the book in two sittings in one afternoon with only a break for food and drink.The story line centres around the kidnapping of a senior judge and is written from the perspective of many of the main characters. The tension is built as the story progresses not only as the plot develops but also because it is unclear for much of the book exactly why the judge has been taken and who is masterminding the crime. The author gives the reader red herrings and clues and is able to include just enough detail to paint a picture whilst avoiding wordy and over flowery passages which would distract from the action.Whilst no-one would pretend that the book compares with great fiction such as Pride & Prejudice or War & Peace but as an example of its genre it is excellent and deserving of your attention.

Diane is the wife of Billy Manchester and is a good friend of Max Freeman, so it is no surprise that Billy contacts Max to be involved in the investigation. I have to confess that I haven\u2019t read any of the Max Freeman series, I believe that this book is the 7th in the series. I will be reading them though, since I loved this book. As I said, the story opens with the kidnapping of the federal judge. We are given clues that there are two groups of people involved in the kidnapping. Those that have arranged it and are in charge and a young couple who are obviously in over their head. Diane is not your normal kidnap victim, she tries to keep her wits about her, and is careful to do things that might leave a trail for the investigation that she knows must be going on.

The story alternates between the investigator who is searching for the kidnappers and the judge that has been kidnapped and also one of the kidnappers. The parts of the story that had to do with the perspective of the judge and the kidnapper were interesting, and kept me reading. The parts that dealt with the search for the kidnappers by the investigator, were uninteresting to me and did not hold my interest. I found myself putting the book down when I got to those chapters. This is why I rated the book 3 stars as opposed to 4 stars. Towards the end the book picked up steam as most of the events were about Diane the kidnapped judge and Rae, the kidnapper.
