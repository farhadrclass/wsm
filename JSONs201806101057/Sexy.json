This one is another good story with familiar Oates themes: class, complex characters, gritty realism and no clear answers. I read it in one sitting- the short chapters and good pacing will make this a good pick for reluctant readers. Although I get why it's called \"Sexy,\" I think the title may disappoint teen readers as it is not literally a sexy book in the usual way. Who knows though?

Treating this as a teen book is both radical and lame. Rad cause it is honest and straightforward without the all too typical patronizing teen-speak, but lame because well, yeah, what the hell is a teen book? Yes, it deals with high school, yes it deals with teens, but so do lots of books. I suppose it\u00b4s all how it\u00b4s marketed and if it motivates school libraries to shelve this, it is one not ridiculous teen book, typically housed on cobwebbed high school library shelves. As usual Oates is at full throttle, never beyond the scope of her points, never tangendential, and her hallmark stark prose is as visible as ever. Also, I\u00b4d like to note that I am both a teacher and a homosexual. And though I have never been accused of child-molestation directly, it is not something I don\u00b4t worry about, like who will think what if they knew I were gay, will the parents feel comfortable, or will the children be able to get it, or continue to learn from me..., and so on. My 12th form students asked me if I were, and I got out a yeah, and was met with none of the nightmare situations one could dream of, but I was nervous about the repercussions, not only for the above reasons, but for the questions \"will I lose my job?\" \"will this end my career in education?\" and well it didn\u00b4t. and it was a good educational and personal decision in the long run, as the two cannot and should not be separated, it is conservative rhetoric that does no one any good, because keeping kids in the dark about who we are, is the same false, patronizing bullshit that teens find so contemptuous about adults, and this alas prevents dialogue. Yet this behavior is perpetuated through fear. And this breeds the kind of bullshit situations like false molestation accusations, ongoing homophobia, gay teen suicides, and really annoying myopic opinions which don\u00b4t just end in high school, but are carried into adulthood and manifest into discrimination, abuse, murder, all perpetuated because we are too shy to ask, or too scared to tell or talk candidly with our teenagers as teachers or as parents.So, yeah, I give this book 5 stars for not being ridiculous material for teens about gay discrimination, for handling teen-sex maturely and unflinchingly, and raising questions about an infuriatingly taboo topic."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/860913-carrie", "userReview": "Interesting...Joyce Carol Oates for the teen set. Who knew? I found some of the details and plot lines to be a bit predictable or stereotypical. A teacher, (effeminate aka might be gay-that's new) is accused of engaging in inappropriate behavior with some young boys/men (again new concept and for the record there is a difference between being gay and being a pedophile, a big difference). Eventually we learn something did happen between him and the teacher. The twist is the reader knows all the accusations are not true, we just aren't sure what is true. Without explicitly reading it in the text we get the feeling the student is conflicted about his sexuality, though the books ends on a strange note with the student engaged in a explicit scene with an older college woman.

I saw that many people in the reviews found the book confusing and had to read in multiple times to understand, they didn't understand how any of it was related and none of the questions were answered, the author did this on purpose, your supposed to read between the lines and decide for yourself whether Mr. Tracy's a pedophile or if Darren is gay which is one of the aspects of the book I found interesting.

We don't see him doing anything to right the wrong, we don't see him doing anything to fix anything, or to show that he regrets not doing anything. We get a lot of one word sentences and a very superficial teenage boy who has no growth in this story and nothing has changed except there's a tragedy.Especially considering the gravity of this book - covering pedophilia and homophobia - very little of it is actually addressed in any real way.

That's all I can say. I think Joyce Carol Oates hates teenagers. I'm kidding, of course, but I can't help noticing that her young adult books highlight pretty much everything that sucks about adolescence. This book is a sweaty, testosterone-fueled nightmare. As a gay man who regularly interacts with children, the story, which involves an effeminate teacher being accused of abusing students, is discomforting, depressing, and extremely disturbing. Its depiction of wayward youth in the corrupt American education system, which encourages unlawfulness, is an all too real reflection of how things really are. To make matters worse, it takes place in New Hampshire, and, being a resident of New England, this book felt too close to home. I did sympathize with the main teenage protagonist in his various dilemmas and the book became easier to swallow as it continued on, but the book was still too painful for me."}, {"userName": "Ashton Seibert", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76873680-ashton-seibert", "userReview": "I read this book around 2006 or 2007 and it left quite an impression on me as an adolescent. Maybe its themes were a bit too adult for one who isn't quite a teen but this story had a melodramatic flair that excited the romantic in me. Its discussion of sex and sexuality was also exciting for me as I was just beginning to explore my own. Not a bad book but I'm certain I would feel much differently if I read it now as an adult. Once you begin to peel back its layers the plot does feel quite shallow but you cannot help but to feel for the main character who has been pushed into a turbulent situation during what's already an emotionally vulnerable time in the life of a teen. If you're a teen I would recommend this book as I feel its most relevant to those in that age group, stay away if you're an adult.

But after you open up the book, you discover that it\u2019s not all about the glitz and glamour of being good looking, but instead the lessons of love, loyalty, and trust. Darren Flynn had always had troubles with talking to girls; it was just awkward. However, most girls would practically be filled with joy at the thought of him just talking to them. He understood that this was the way girls felt towards him, but didn't always have enough confidence. Some days he\u2019d feel on top of the world, confident, sexy, but other days he just felt like nobody cared or saw him. One girl in particular, however, Darren is very fond of; Molly Rawlings. She\u2019s a smart, quiet young lady that works hard at school to achieve perfection. Although this story isn't about his love life, the author did incorporate the connection between the two shy high schoolers.\u201cMolly Rawlings was standing by her locker, wiping at her eyes . . . Darren\u2019s first impulse was to avoid Molly . . . Seeing her so upset, though, made him feel a sudden rush of affection for her. He wanted to protect her! Went to comfort her, squeezing her arm, hugging her . . . It wasn't typical of Darren Flynn . . . to hang out at any girl\u2019s locker, let alone be so openly affectionate.\u201dDetermined and respectful are probably the two powerful words that adults in Darren\u2019s life think of him as. This year, as a junior, he made varsity on the North Falls swim team but it doesn't just stop there. Darren works strenuously hard to keep up, improve, and achieve the same abilities as the better swimmers on the team. Coach constantly compliments him on his perseverance and other teachers are surprised to witness how well mannered he is. \u201cGood work, Darren. But you can do better. Coach Ellroy was always saying this. Darren knew it was a compliment; definitely Coach didn't say this to all the guys . . . Swim your heart out! What else do you have? . . . he\u2019d lost count of the laps, he was confused now, his vision blotched and he was only just swimming because . . . he\u2019d forgotten how to stop.\u201dWho can anyone trust? This was a major question that was present throughout the entire novel. After an English teacher failed several swim team students because of a tough essay, they wanted revenge; not just any old prank, something that would really affect him. Darren couldn't trust any of his friends, they were even lying to the authorities. Somehow Darren wanted out of this mess, but who could help him?\u201cSo say something, Jimmy. You could.\u201d . . . \u201cDarren you know I can\u2019t. And you can\u2019t either. Anything I said or you said, the other guys would deny it; it\u2019s their word against ours. We can\u2019t snitch out our friends . . . The cops and the DA people made up their minds right away, and they won\u2019t change their minds . . .\u201d The plot was fairly simple to realize; trust. This was apparent in the story as soon as the main conflict with Darren and a tough English teacher, Mr. Tracy, began. Suddenly, the teacher shows a little bit of interest in Darren and makes him feel uncomfortable, which creates the whole idea for the students\u2019 revenge. Darren couldn't trust anyone; his teachers, friends, family, and even Molly Rawlings, his secret crush. I awarded this novel four out of five stars because it was an eventful book with many twists and turns. This novel also had a lot to tell and was like no other book I had read. Sexy taught the lesson of what can happen and how tangled you can get when you\u2019re caught in a web of lies like Darren and his friends were in. However, this story didn't really have a clean finish, or tie up the loose ends very well because it didn't explain what all happened with Molly Rawlings and Darren and it didn't conclude whether or not people found out the students were lying. Although I do have a feeling the author had the intentions of keeping the ending open, that wasn't quite the style I enjoy best, unless there is a sequel."}], "description": "Sixteen-year-old Darren Flynn, a popular, good-looking high school athlete who lacks self-confidence, learns that his jock friends are hatching a revenge act against their English teacher for failing a member of the swim team.", "title": "Sexy", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12523.Sexy", "average": 3.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389485866l/12523.jpg", "reviews": 148, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3524.Joyce_Carol_Oates", "name": "Joyce Carol Oates"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Fiction", "Lgbt", "Contemporary", "Realistic Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12523.Sexy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1258314.Sexy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12091182-sexy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9668156-seksi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20499040-snygg", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3031636-sexy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32947850-sexy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5204.We_Were_the_Mulvaneys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15967.The_Falls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15972.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15975.Blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156222.Foxfire"]}
