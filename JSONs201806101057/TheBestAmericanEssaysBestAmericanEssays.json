Cheryl Strayed has assembled a treasure chest of essays that lean heavily to the personal, transformative, life-altering side of the genre and it makes for a heavy and rewarding reading experience. My favorites are Tod Goldberg'sessay on Duk Koo Kim, Vanessa Veselka's serial killer meditation, the essays by Megan Stielstra and Michelle Mirsky about their children, the Steven Harvey essay about his mom's suicide, and so many others (already feeling guilty for not mentioning show stoppers by Ander Monson and Charles Baxter). This book also includes my essay, I'm Jumping Off the Bridge. It's such an honor to be in this book and it's something that I'll be proud of forever."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1280008-gabrielle", "userReview": "When did The Best American Essays become The Best American Personal Essays? I was eager to read this anthology edited by Cheryl Strayed, and though I enjoyed the essays she selected, I found it very perplexing, indeed disturbing, that all the essays anthologized in this volume hued to the strictly personal narrative. Remember Jo Ann Beard\u2019s \u201cWerner\u201d from the 2007 volume? A great essay with no \u201cI\u201d in sight. What happened? The essay is a wonderful elastic form. And though, I repeat, I loved the essays included, they did not by any stretch of the imagination; give full expression to the form."}, {"userName": "N", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5702557-n", "userReview": "Anthologies are always hard to rate and review, but this one I liked a lot. While few of the essays blew my mind, I enjoyed most of them largely because of Strayed's aesthetic, which favors the personal. Some of the best ones were by Matthew Vollmer, Mako Yoshikawa, Eileen Pollack, Jon Kerstetter, Ander Monson, and Tod Goldberg. The standout essay was the last, Steven Harvey's \"The Book of Knowledge,\" and I think the editors considered it the standout as well since they let it conclude the collection; Strayed forewent BAE's tradition of alphabetizing by author, and this gave the collection a distinct shape and emphasis. It's also pertinent to note that this volume featured more women writers than have many BAEs, and I hope this better ratio will continue to improve. Lastly, I'll say that Strayed's introduction was the best I've read in a while; many BAE editors abuse their introduction privilege, but Strayed shows her artistry and conscientiousness in writing a pithy, smart intro that does all it should while keeping its focus not on the editor's lofty views and accomplishments but on the forthcoming essays."}, {"userName": "Andreea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1245700-andreea", "userReview": "I have to admit I skipped some of the last essays by men because they seemed a little too repetitive in their excessive manliness (you know that kind of deeply manly sentimental writing where men are super sad but they only express it through elaborate metaphors about manly stuff like boxing and basketball). But I think I enjoyed most of the essays in this and I enjoyed that unlike the previous collection of these I read (I think that was the 2014 BAE), this one had fairly clear recurring themes (such as childbirth / infants / childhood) which echoed between the essays and kept me reading the whole collection rather than just dipping in and out based on interesting titles. I especially enjoyed Vanessa Vaselka's \"Highway of Lost Girls\", Steven Harvey's \"The Book of Knowledge\" and Angela Morales's \"The Girls In My Town\"."}, {"userName": "Tripp", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/780667-tripp", "userReview": "I have some brief notes on several of the essays here, though I enjoyed them all to varying degrees. \"His Last Game\" is, I think, my favorite.\"The Girls In My Town\" -- Angela Morales, Southwest ReviewStructured by 13 numbered sections. Set in Merced, California, in the valley between the Sierras and the coast; the town has a significant Latino population. Morales devotes section 1 to a description of the town, especially its depressed economy and moves in like manner through sections about a boy in her composition class who is a likely candidate to impregnate one of the eponymous girls and leave her to care for the baby by herself, the prevalence of meth in the area, the local Teen Parent Program, Morales' own experiences being pregnant (at 32) in the same town with so many teenage mothers, the sad and horrifying legend of La Llorona as well as one of Llorona's real-life counterparts in Merced, and ends with Morales' thoughts about her daughter, now 14, and the daughter of a teenage mother who gave birth on the same day as Morales: what has life been like for that other girl, now 14 as well? What are her chances of overcoming economics and family history?\"Sometimes A Romantic Notion\" -- Richard Schmitt, Gettysburg ReviewBegins when a member of the writer's department mentions that his grandfather \"ran off\" to join the circus. Schmitt has fun with this phrase, and uses his 10-years of life in the circus to describe how virtually impossible it is to \"run off\" and join the circus. Gradually widens to analyze how preposterous and unlikely romantic notions are when seen in reality and why we cling to them anyway. Slightly anticlimactic ending when he draws a parallel to his own romantic notion that fiction writers \"simply [make] things up out of thin air,\" rather than finish on the idea of romantic notions as anodyne to banality, or some similar conclusion.\"His Last Game\" -- Brian Doyle, Notre Dame MagazinePowerful three-page essay. Doyle and his brother, in their fifties, drive to the pharmacy for his brother's prescriptions but take a meandering route by an arboretum and stop at a park at dusk to watch a 3-on-3 pickup basketball game. The capsule descriptions of each player are little gems. Then, in the midst of the hoops analysis, including a bet made on the game, this: \"You owe me a dollar. We better go get my prescriptions. They are not going to do any good but we better get them anyway so they don't go to waste. One less thing for my family to do afterward. That game was good\u2026.\" The essay pivots on that sentence and a sadness that the reader sensed but wasn't sure of begins to seep into the tone. The closing paragraph is perfect.\"When They Let Them Bleed\" -- Tod Goldberg, HobartTod works outward from November 13, 1982, when as an 11-year-old he watched the Ray Mancini-Duk Koo Kim bantamweight title fight, which ended with Kim in a coma from which he would die within days. He alternates analysis of the boxing culture at the time, the coverage of boxing in Sports Illustrated, with his home life at the time, his habit of cutting himself, his mother's live-in boyfriend--one of those people who manage to be horrible without committing any crime--and his mother's death 28 years almost to the day after that of Kim.\"Pigeons\" -- Eileen Pollack, Prairie SchoonerPollack revisits her old elementary school after four decades, and explores the memories it conjures: the different expectations for girls and boys, especially where math was concerned, and how frustrating she found this double standard; the school psychologist and how utterly he failed to understand elementary-age children; the casual use of corporal punishment to maintain order, especially in the case of the black students. She is haunted by one particularly brutal incident that she accidentally caused: \"I watched in horror as he tugged Walter by the ear into that dreadful belfry--the darkroom, I suddenly thought--and we listened to the sounds of a grown man throwing a boy half his size against a wall.\"\"Highway of Lost Girls\" -- Vanessa Vaselka, GQHarrowing account of her years as a teenage runaway, circa 1985, her survival mechanisms hitching rides from truckers, the extraordinary misogyny of that culture and that culture's role as a sort of petri dish for cultivating serial killers. The stats are terrifying: \"In 2009 the feds went public with a program called the Highway Serial Killings Initiative in response to the rising number of dead bodies found along the interstates\u2026.Narrowing the field to those last seen around truck stops and rest areas, the bureau counted over five hundred bodies, almost all women. Of the two hundred people on a suspect list, almost all of them were long-haul truckers.\" Vaselka details her effort to see if her most chilling hitch was with incarcerated serial killer Robert Ben Rhoades. The answer, though not definitive, is probably \"yes.\"\"THe Exhibit Will Be So Marked\" -- Ander Monson, The Normal SchoolThis wonderful example of an essay with associative structure begins with a mix-CD project Monson launched for his 33rd birthday. One of the offerings he receives is a micro-cassette without a case from an anonymous source and the essay follows his attempt to fix the cassette and listen to it, as well as to figure out who sent it. In doing so, it ranges across Nebraska City, Nebraska, the differences between desert and semiarid environments, fruit tree grafting, the Alabama-Auburn football rivalry, a Belle & Sebastian cover of \"Sweet Home Alabama\" at an Atlanta concert, and more. He does hear what's on the tape and figures out who sent it, by the way.\"Some Notes on Attunement\" -- Zadie Smith, The New YorkerSmith contrasts her openness to the new and to change in fiction with her resistance to the same in music, taking as a case in point her \"not getting\" Joni Mitchell until, suddenly, she did, at Tintern Abbey, of all places. She analyzes this epiphany and in so doing calls on Wordsworth, Seneca, what it means to be a connoisseur, Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac, and Mitchell's wariness of being pigeonholed by the expectations of her audience.\"Free Rent At the Totalitarian Hotel\" -- Poe Ballantine, The SunDocuments Ballantine's time in Eureka, California during the late 1980s, right when the stock market crashed in 1987. Sharply observed details of life among his artists friends, all of them poor, contrasting the panicked speculations among pundits about what the crash might mean with how little the vanishing of so much phantom money meant to people who had almost no actual money.\"Epilogue: Deadkidistan\" -- Michelle Mirsky, McSweeney'sMirsky, who works for a children's hospital advising its administration and doctors on what it's like being the parent of a patient, describes the year her own young son, Lev, was a patient there, his death, and the two years following. She does an excellent job; the experience is exactly as awful as you imagine it must be.\"The Book of Knowledge\" -- Steven Harvey, River TeethHis parents' purchase in 1952 of the ten-volume Book of Knowledge, and specifically his mother's use of it to fill in perceived gaps in her education after the family moved from Kansas to a suburb of New York City, is the springboard for Harvey's essay. He uses this set of encyclopedias as well as a cache of family photographs--photographs he didn't look at for 50 years--and letters his mother wrote to her own mother, to understand his mother's suicide when he was twelve.\"Keeper of the Flame\" -- Matthew Vollmer, New England Review<?i>Describes a recent outing with his father, a dentist, to visit a patient on a social call in the man's Blue Ridge Mountain castle. The man, whom Vollmer's father refers to as \"the Nazi\"--though the man might or might not actually sympathize with the National Socialist agenda of Germany in the 1930s and 1940s--has built an actual castle in southwestern North Carolina and gathered a unique collection of World War II German Army artifacts. The visit is eerie; Vollmer can't bring himself to ask any of the questions that might discover whether the man is simply an odd collector or is an actual Nazi sympathizer, and the man is coolly noncommittal during the entire visit. Vollmer then gets a surprise when the man opens a ledger with the names of hundreds of SS officers and places his finger on one name: Vollmer. \"He didn't say, 'See, you do have Nazis in your family.' He just tapped the name with his finger. It was as if he wanted this--the fact that people with the same surname as ours had served under Hitler--to sink in on its own.\""}, {"userName": "Anie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127613-anie", "userReview": "As an author, Cheryl Strayed tends toward the personal, as her memoir and Dear Sugar attest.

In this volume, I discovered another writer with equally darkly powerful voice (and just bought his book) \u2013 J.D. Daniels. Other highlights were \u2013 Zadie Smith\u2019s complex, philosophical essay on what she calls \u2018attunement\u2019 (it\u2019s mostly about the mechanisms by which we connect to artworks), heartbreaking essays about lost girls by Vanessa Veselka and Angela Morales, and another devastating essay about the death of a child by Michelle Mirsky.

Similar to last year's editor, Cheryl Strayed tends towards a certain form of the essay, the personal essay. Luckily for Strayed, the personal essay does have a wide breadth of approaches and I was much more taken with this edition. Strayed mentions that she chose essays that transported her, and these personal essays do. They are poignant and funny, researched and reflective. The publications that Strayed drew from were a bit more representative of the wide variety of essay venues that exist than last year's edition. The essayists seem to be more diverse in age, cultural background, and gender, than previous years. Definitely a good read and a great way to explore the personal essay. I still would like to see an editor pull together a collection of personal essays, and reviews, and thought pieces, and lyrical rumination, and experimental work.

But according to the folks at the Best American series, especially guest editor Cheryl Strayed, an essay is a personal reminiscence. In essence, what we have here is the Best American Memoirs of 2013.Many of these essays follow the same template: they link a personal memory to a concrete set of facts. The best of these are John Jeremiah Sullivan's \"Ghost Estates,\" which ties together his search for his Irish roots with the burst of the Irish housing boom and the work of John Millington Synge. Another is the extraordinary \"The Book of Knowledge,\" by Steven Harvey, who links the children's encyclopedia of the title to his faint memory of his mother, who killed herself when he was 12. Yet another example of this tactic is \"When They Let Them Bleed,\" by Tod Goldberg, who recounts his childhood adversities while remembering the death in the ring of boxer Duk Koo Kim at the hands of Ray \"Boom Boom\" Mancini.Death is, as one might expect, a big topic here. There are also essays by Vanessa Veselka, on girls murdered while hitchhiking (\"Highway of Lost Girls\") and Michelle Mirsky's \"Epilogue: Deadkidistan,\" dealing with the death of her child. There's also \"Field Notes on Hair,\" Vicki Weiqui Yang's essay about losing her hair during chemo treatment for a brain tumor.I appreciated the funnier essays. The lead off one is \"Free Rent at the Totalitarian Hotel,\" by Poe Ballantine, on the weird comings and goings at a rooming house. He recalls that his landlady's dead husband was \"a big-game hunter, he had labeled all his Cryovacked packages in permanent black marker: ELK, ELEPHANT, BLACK BEAR, ZEBRA, GAZELLE. So far I had been reluctant to try any of it for fear that Mrs. Vollstanger had actually killed, dressed, and Cryovacked her husband.\"Another funny one, although also scary, is Matthew Vollmer's \"Keeper of the Flame.\" Vollmer's father, a dentist, takes him to visit one of his patients, who keeps one of the largest collections of Nazi memorabilia in an underground vault. Another funny and scary one, and my favorite in the whole collection, is \"What Happens in Hell,\" by Charles Baxter. He tells the story of how he had a driver while in San Francisco, a Pakistani man who tells him all about Hell. Later, the driver will fall asleep at the wheel, and Baxter recounts the harrowing accident he gets into. \"But all I could think of then and now was, That expert on Hell almost got me killed.\"Other highlights are \"The Art of Being Born,\" by Marcia Aldrich, a memoir of a pregnancy, told to her newborn child. This kind of thing usually is fodder for women's magazines, but it's much better than that, and has a rollicking tone: \"I woke up late, having spent the night beached on the couch in the living room, memorizing the distinguishing signs of every rash chronicled in Dr. Spock's baby book, until nodding off around six. The book lay open to cradle cap, flaking patches of skin on the tops of newborn heads, which might be 'cracked, greasy, or even weeping.'\"Not every essay here grabbed me. Dagoberto Gil's \"A Little Bit of Fun Before He Died,\" about a garrulous writing teacher colleague, wasn't all that well focused, and I think the subject wasn't as interesting as Gil thinks he was. And frankly, I have no idea what was going on in J.D. Daniels' \"Letter from Majorca.\"I'll finish with Zadie Smith's \"Some Notes on Attunement,\" how a black woman became a huge fan of Joni Mitchell: \"I can't listen to Joni Mitchell in a room with other people, or on an an iPod, walking the streets. Too risky. I can never guarantee that I'm going to be able to get through the song without being made transparent--to anybody and everything, to the whole world. A mortifying sense of porousness.\" The best of these essays do exhibit a mortifying sense of porousness, perhaps for the author, but enrichment for us."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3538215-alan", "userReview": "This is an amazing book of first person, biographical essays in which each author takes the reader on a journey of discovery.

Keeper of the Flame, a visit to a man\u2019s castle to look at his collection of Nazi artifactsMy Father\u2019s Women, about a daughter\u2019s search through the life of her father, a child prodigy who became a fusion reactor research scientist at Princeton, for evidence that he loved any of his wives or girlfriends and how his life was affected by depression.Triage, a war surgeon\u2019s nightmare about sorting patients into the no help possible categoryThe Art of Being, contrasting the difficult birth in the 1950\u2019s when mothers were kept away from the baby for weeks and births today which includes silly plans that are quickly discarded. What Happens in Hell, the story about a bad taxi accident in which the author walked away. The Exhibit will be so Marked, a fascinating discussion that began on the topic of cassette mixes then traveled to different cities and times before returning to mixes again. The Girls in my Town, another discussion of childbirth but this time contrasting the experiences of 14-year old girls and a woman in her 30\u2019s. Some Notes on Attunement, a great discussion of how Smith attuned her ear to appreciate Joni Mitchell\u2019s music while at the same time raising good questions about how age and culture affect our tastes. His Last Game, about two 50-year old brothers who drove into the city to watch kids playing . Field Notes on Hair, a first person story of a young woman who had a stroke at age 19 and had an awful time with radiation treatments. Ghost Estates, about the unfinished houses built on the coastline of Ireland during the boom and deserted after 2008 due to bank crisis and housing bust. The author was a student who came to research his family and wound up appreciate the writer, John Millington Synge (Playboy of the Western World), who wrote Aran Island walking guides 200 years earlier.Channel B, a great discussion of how a video baby monitor contributed to postpartum depression of an urban monitor as the Wifi in the apartment allowed other people to watch her baby and she could watch another one, A Little Bit Of Fun Before He Died, about Bill Ripley, an alcoholic writing teacher in Texas who inspired a Sheryl Crow lyric. Epilogue: Deadkidistan, a first-person account of a woman who helps hospitals meet the needs of parents with sick children \u2013 whose own child died of cancer and she had an awful time grieving for more than 2 years. It reminded me of all my fears about my own children getting sick when they were small.

I looked up Cheryl Strayed online and discovered her big hit is Wild, which is, get this: Strayed reflecting on her journey across the Pacific Crest Trail, taken in her early 20\u2019s after her mother died and her marriage ended in ruin.Conclusion: Cheryl Strayed has very limited interests; or may be a narcissist.Anyway, my three favorites were:Keeper of the Flame by Matthew Vollmer \u2014 The author\u2019s dad invites him to meet \u201cthe Nazi\u201d. Turns out there is a castle filled with a rare and complete set of Third Reich memorabilia in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. This combines two key elements that make a great essay: A strange and interesting topic paired with a shall-we-say, moral thrust, that interrogates the reader and their worldview.The Exhibit Will Be So Marked by Ander Monson \u2014 On his thirty-third birthday, Monson asks for friends and family to send him mix-tapes (so that he can evaluate what they think of him and their relationship via their choice of music). He also receives a broken cassette in an unmarked envelope sent from Nebraska City, Nebraska. The author details his attempts to find a way to listen to the tape mixed with a hodgepodge of scenes from his life; a life mix tape. In less adept hands, this could be insufferable, but instead it is very clever and wearily uplifting.The Girls in My Town by Angela Morales \u2014 Childbirth. It\u2019s another topic covered in several essays and this is the best one. Morales, in her early thirties, gives birth and lays in a hospital room a curtain over from a fourteen year old who has just done the same. She goes on to explore the combination of sexism, racism, boredom, and mislaid-hope that has led to an enormous amount of teen pregnancies in her central Californian home of Merced. It is a very good (and I\u2019m a sucker for righteous anger)."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/638550-daniel", "userReview": "This review originally published in Looking For a Good Book. Rated 4.0 of 5Clearly I'm behind in my reading since this is from 2013, though I will admit that it's one of my older ARC's.I've written before that I really like the Best American series and the essays are probably my most favored in the series (though the Science and Nature Essays might be a close second). However, this is not the sort of book that I will just sit and read, cover to cover, but instead it's the sort of book that I will read an essay or two, put the book down, then come back to read a couple of essays some time later.I found that nearly all the essays selected were very well written and mostly engaging, or captured my interest. I think this is credit to the book's editor Cheryl Strayed. Although the series is edited by Robert Atwan, each book has a different editor. Cheryl Strayed's tastes appear to be similar to my own.In a collection such as this, it is typically difficult to pick a favorite, but it was easy to pick one that stood out - \"The Exhibit Will Be So Marked\" by Ander Monson. The essay starts with: \"A couple of years ago, I asked friends and family to make me a mix cd for my birthday, hoping to get thirty-three mix cds, one per year I'd lived.\" And I was hooked. Monson explains that he received 55 mix cds and he writes his essays, reflecting on the cds, and what the songs say to him. It's a wonderful piece that really spoke to me.Whether it's about family, friends, loved-ones or hated enemies, love or death, the essays here really sing and it's nice to see that the essay, as a literary form, continues to do well. I recommend the book, as part of the series, and I definitely recommend this 2013 entry.This book contains:Introduction by Cheryl Strayed\"Free Rent at the Totalitarian Hotel\" - Poe Ballantine\"Night\" - Alice Munro\"Sometimes a Romantic Notion\" - Richard Schmitt\"Highway of Lost Girls\" - Vanessa Veselka\"Keeper of the Flame\" - Matthew Vollmer\"Breeds of America\" - William Melvin Kelley\"My Father's Women\" - Mako Yoshikawa\"Confession's of an Ex-Mormon\" - Walter Kirn\"I'm Jumping Off the Bridge\" - Kevin SampsellPigeons\" - Eileen Pollack\"Triage\" - Jon Kerstetter\"The Art of Being Born\" - Marcia Aldrich\"What Happens in Hell\" - Charles Baxter\"The Exhibit Will Be So Marked\" - Ander Monson\"The Girls in My Town\" - Angela Morales\"Some Notes on Attunement\" - Zadie Smith\"His Last Game\" - Brian Doyle\"When They Let Them Bleed\" - Tod Goldberg\"Field Notes on Hair\" - Vicki Weiqi Yang\"Letter From Majorca\" - J.D.

The Best American Essays 2013, edited by Cheryl Strayed, is a wonderful collection of essays and highly recommended.I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7562434-david", "userReview": "I took an advanced exposition class in college. The professor was passionate about creative non-fiction. All we read were essays. All we wrote were essays. One of the texts for the class was the Best American Essays of 2006. I'd never seen nor heard of the Best American Series, and as we worked our way through the book we read some amazing pieces of writing.Inspired by the memory I dug out my copy of 2006. I bought 2008, I asked for 2013 for Christmas. I figured I had to start somewhere! These collections are a wonderful way to get your hands on excellent, high quality pieces of creative non-fiction. You can't go wrong if that is what you're looking for. Think of it like, \"This American Life\" in print form. (Sans theme?) ((I dunno))Essays #1 - #5Having read the first five pieces in the book, I can tell you right away there is no common thread or theme so far, other than that these are all really interesting. While all published in 2012, the first five pieces span decades of time, and capture glimpses of America. \"Sometimes a Romantic Notion\" and \"Highway of Lost Girls\" are both standout pieces from the first portion, but they're all seriously good.Rest of the BookI'm not going to profile every essay. Overall, I really enjoyed this collection. It's only the second Best American Essays I've read, and it is really solid. (I feel the short stories are a lot more hit or miss). There were perhaps only two or so that I wasn't that into (The Joni Mitchell piece).If you are interested in memoirs, or interested in creative non-fiction, the Best American Essays should be a regular part of your yearly reading rotation"}, {"userName": "Justine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30987-justine", "userReview": "Reading anthologies is hard \u2013 mostly because I don\u2019t know how to approach them. Do I start at the beginning and work my way to the end? Is it permissible for me to skip pieces I don\u2019t like? Should I think about it like the pacing of an album (when people still cared about that) and expect the editor to have created some kind of arc or flow or pace I should follow? Can I just buy the single? It's been a while since I've read essays - after initially falling in love with and devouring all the works of David Foster Wallace, I've turned toward more escapist reading (e.g. fiction or highly esoteric non fiction). In picking up this collection, I remembered what makes essays so fun to read. Whether or not it's true*, there is something about the essay that feels much more genuine and transparent than fiction or poetry, or even non fiction. I like that each essay (especially those in this collection) are so deeply rooted in the author's personal experience and interpretation of the world. Whether that be a relative running away to join the circus, witnessing the death of a boxer, or trying to identify a serial killer that may have attempted to kill the author, there is (real or feigned) authenticity that really makes me tick. I get the sense that while many (of these?) authors may not be my favorite novelists or journalists or poets when their writing is unlimited in subject or scope**, in the confines of an essay, their work is uniquely compelling. Welcome back to the genre, Justine - I'll be sure to keep at it. * I get it jerks, it is likely NOT true. ** I am also aware there are notable exceptions in this collection."}, {"userName": "Roxanne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134743-roxanne", "userReview": "The Best American Essays series is sometimes hit or miss for me. I remember one volume (but don't recall the year) where every single essay was just crazy depressing. It was good writing, but I just didn't want to keep going. Not so with this collection, which just goes to show that it all depends on the guest editor of the year. I love Cheryl Strayed's writing, and it turns out I like her as an editor as well. Strayed writes in the introduction to the collection that each of these essays \"made me feel, for the brief time I spent reading them, as if the rest of the world had fallen away.... As if nothing would ever be the same again.\" Keeping this in mind as sort of a rough theme, I can totally see where Strayed is coming from; flipping through the collection now, I almost want to read it again. My favorite story was the one that F (who read the book first) told me about, knowing I'd like it, and the reason he gave me the book to read when he'd finished: \"Channel B\", about a young mother in an apartment complex who discovers that someone else in her building has the same model baby monitor, because she can tune in to their frequency and watch the other baby. \"Highway of Lost Girls\" was haunting. \"El Camino Doloroso\" is a peek into a brief moment that changes things, an anecdote of the sort we all hear but given backstory and emotional weight. There's something I could say about every essay in this collection. If you've ever thought about picking up a volume from Best American, this is a great one; if you've ever wanted to read nonfiction but didn't know where to start, I recommend here."}, {"userName": "Shonna Froebel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14633278-shonna-froebel", "userReview": "This collection of essays has a great variety of topics, and writers from young to old. This year's selection was chosen by Cheryl Strayed from the selections given her by series editor Robert Atwan. The essays were previously published in a variety of literary magazines, both those well-known like The New Yorker, and those less heard of like River Teeth. So this selection highlights not only the writers, but also the magazines that first accepted the pieces included here. This volume includes a Foreword by the series editor, Atwan which tells of how he came to this, but also talks about the sources for the essays, and the selection process. Then we have an introduction by Strayed, which talks of her essay experiences and her selection process. A list of the long list that the twenty-six included here was whittled down from is included at the back of the book, for those who want to read more great essays.The writers here run from those whose names are familiar, i.e. Alice Munro and Zadie Smith, to those lesser known like Michelle Mirsky and Jon Kerstetter. The topics range from experiences with landlords and fellow tenants to war triage to race to car accidents.Besides being reflections of real experiences, the other things they all have in common is good writing. Really good writing. After reading a collection like this, I always think that I should read more essays as I enjoy them so much."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/727334-amy", "userReview": "I think its really difficult to rate anthologies since they contain so many different elements but I'm basing my rating of this on how I felt about it as a whole after finishing. I only skipped 2 essays which I just couldn't connect two. The rest were all either good or great. I took my time getting through these essays, dipping in and out as I felt like it. It worked well for me. There were two stand out essays for me - Tod Goldberg's essay about Duk Koo Kim and Steven Harvey's essay about his mother's suicide. Those are the two that will stay with me ... that I haven't forgotten about and that really resonated with me. Frankly, I'm surprised that the Duk Koo Kim essay worked for me given the subject matter but it was fantastic. And it goes to show that it's not always the topic that matters, but the writing. It was written so compellingly well that I didn't want it to end. And there were passages of Steven Harvey's essay that literally brought me to tears - due to how beautifully written they were AND how they resonated with some of the things I've experienced in my life. This collection is worth it, just for those two essays, but there are many others worth the read. As I said, there were just two that I didn't' enjoy. I also recommend Cheryl Strayed's introduction which is also fantastic! I recommend this collection, especially to those who enjoy personal narrative essays!"}, {"userName": "John Keats", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25035787-john-keats", "userReview": "These collections tend to be, for me, three-star affairs; they almost have to be, since the only real unity is the taste of the editors. When you get a bold editor with eclectic tastes, like David Foster Wallace in 2007, I think you have a better shot at ending up with a richer, or at least more consistently remarkable, volume (which that year's was), but that's no slight against everyone else, or Cheryl Strayed this year. She does favor the personal piece, and in her introduction she gives a nice example of what she's looking for, the sense that the writer felt the experience described was life-altering. Maybe I don't agree with all her choices, but you can't ask more from an editor than an admission of what her guiding principles are. My favorite pieces tended to be the shorter ones, Brian Doyle's \"His Last Game,\" and David Searcy's \"El Camino Doloroso,\" both very powerful and concentrated. Steven Harvey's \"The Book of Knowledge\" is also excellent, and a great example of how to richly treat a hard subject while insulating the reader from discomfort, something I've often failed at."}, {"userName": "Susan Oleksiw", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7607058-susan-oleksiw", "userReview": "As much as I love nonfiction I rarely pick it up when I'm looking for something to read. I received this book from a friend, and I'm now hooked on the excellent work gathered in the series volumes.The 26 essays in the 2013 collection are startling, moving, and enthralling. I can't discuss all of them, so I'll focus on two that take readers into worlds rarely captured in fiction though many try. In \"Free Rent at the Totalitarian Hotel,\" a man who has failed to get his life to move forward gets a month's free rent for helping a landlady with despicable tendencies. The rationalization of poverty and neutrality while evicting tenants wears off after awhile, leaving the narrator with a bad taste in his mouth and a temper ready to say what he feels. In \"Highway of Lost Girls\" the narrator is drawn into a search for the identity of a serial killer and a murdered teenage runaway. The narrator was on the road, also a teenage runaway, at the time the girl's body was found in a dumpster, in the same area where she hitched rides. The story is chilling and mesmerizing, and stranger than any novel a writer can invent."}], "description": "Selected and introduced by Cheryl Strayed,\u00a0the\u00a0New York Times best-selling author
