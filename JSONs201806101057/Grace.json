It is 1838 and Naomi is a slave girl living on a plantation in Faunsdale, Alabama, until a terrifying incident sends her running for her life. She arrives in Georgia and finds shelter in a brothel where she falls for a white man. The result of their secret love is Josey, a baby girl of mixed blood with blonde hair. Josey is a young woman when word of the Emancipation Proclamation reaches her hometown of Tallahassee, Alabama. But though freedom is within reach, unexpected events threaten to stop her and everyone she loves from knowing a life free from servitude. Grace is an intergenerational saga that opens with one of the most compelling introductions yet encountered. After reading the first page, it's impossible to turn away. Readers soon find themselves drawn into a tense narrative liable to make one's stomach turn. By the end of the first chapter, reading the rest of the book is inevitable. It was the first time a man lied for me. It was the familiar ring of a lifesaving untruth. A death rattle that has followed me all my life. Naomi is a flawless narrator. Her voice is authentic and, despite the hardships she endures and the horrors she bears witness to, she harbors an ardent view of the world. Since me and Hazel had our birthday four months ago and I turned fifteen, I started to notice thangs. Like how every spring the musty smell of grass and dew warmed by the sun clogs my nose and makes me sneeze. And how the cotton fields throw small balls in the air and twirl 'em around in the wind. The boys trample 'em under their feet and the girls make doll babies with 'em. Sometimes I imagine the cotton pieces are alive 'cause of how they chase me. Through Naomi's narrative voice, the author finds clever ways to rephrase the ordinary, creating lyrical depictions with few words: [He] went up the steps to greet her, and the whiskey on him turned the air drunk. [She] patters her foot below the hem of her blue satin gown making the fabric bounce and the light reflect off of its sewn-on silver flakes, spitting sparkle. Strong women are prevalent throughout this book, as are the valuable life lessons they are willing to impart. I say, \"Not every woman got the same strong. \"\"What'd you say?\" \"Your momma had the strong to give birth to you, to raise you, to put the strength inside you to do something she never could. Maybe she couldn't be your strong. In the end, you saved yourself.\" Chapters switch between Naomi (told in first perfect narrative) and Josey (as told from Naomi's perspective). A perfect harmony is found in balancing their two stories.Love and sacrifice are at the heart of this gritty yet rich story of persistent women defying the odds. Grace is transcendent."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "4.5 Stars\n\u201cThe peaceful valleyJust over the mountainThe peaceful valleyFew come to knowI may never get thereEver in this lifetimeBut sooner or laterIt's there I will goSooner or later.\u201d\nUp to the Mountain--Patricia J. Griffin This multigenerational family saga weaves back and forth through time and place, between the stories of Naomi, a slave girl who begins life on a plantation in Faunsdale, Alabama, and Josey, Josephine, beginning in the year 1838, through Conyers, Georgia and Tallassee, Alabama in the year 1850. Naomi, seven years old, and Hazel, eleven on her last birthday, are sisters, but Naomi is a secret kept. An early birth that has gone by without being added to the rolls of recorded births.

Time passes, and soon \u2013 too soon \u2013 Naomi is fifteen, and Hazel is nineteen and in love. In the blink of an eye, Naomi\u2019s world changes and she finds herself on the run with no choice but to continue running until she\u2019s as far away from Faunsdale as she can get, heading North. Following the North Star to the promise of a better future. She walks four days, makes it as far as Georgia before she succumbs to the stabbing icy rain, the lack of shoes or food. When she wakes, she is in the home of the woman who saw her fall. Time passes with Naomi in and out of a fog. Naomi\u2019s narration has an air of wistfulness, veneration for life and motherhood, projecting the eternal nature of man toward love, even among the seemingly endless expressions of hate. \u201dWhere do we start when we tell the stories of our loved ones? \u2026 I guess I could start with who begot who like the Bible do, but where somebody comes from only matters to people who come from something and as it was, she came from me.\u201d Naomi\u2019s hovering, recalling the past years of her life, and watching over Josey through all the years of Josey\u2019s life.

But reading it, I thought of murder ballads, those songs of melancholy and injustice. Natashia De\u00f3n's genius lies, in part, in writing a book that sustains a murder ballad's intensity for hundreds of pages and gets into your bones like a song.\" That is so much the feeling I got when reading this book that I almost can't believe it.If you are a fan of any of those books named above, read this one. If you're not a fan of any of them, read this one anyway. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, as it's entirely heartbreaking, but De\u00f3n's skill as a writer is unparalleled. I was floored to see that this is her first novel, because story to her seems to come as natural as breathing. It's an intergenerational family saga of black women in the Civil War South, their courage, their tragedies, and their convictions, written in dialect. I'm fairly surprised it's not as well-known as something like Yaa Gyasi's \"Homegoing\" given how superb it is. I don't want to say too much about plot for fear of giving anything away (the Goodreads description should tell you enough to see if you want to try this for yourself), but I recommend it to everyone. I've read a lot of books I've loved, but only a few I have given the designation of also being \"important\". This book joins Nadia Hashimi's \"The Pearl That Broke Its Shell\" as one of the most powerful, moving, important books I've read all year."}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5321728-andre", "userReview": "Wow. Powerfully rendered. More to come............Wow. Wow. Superbly written and emotionally jarring. I can't say enough great things about this book. It is a novel that is definitely worth reading. The story is told from the perspective of Naomi who narrates the story both as living being then as ancestral spirit. At first, I didn't think this narrative device would work, however Natashia Deon pulled it off in tremendous fashion. As I was reading the book , I was thinking that this would make a great movie because her scene descriptions are so vivid. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that originally she wrote this story as a screenplay. The horrific circumstances that black women had to live under during slavery serves as the foundation of this novel and you will be drawn into the feelings of Naomi and then her daughter Josey as Naomi watches over her from beyond the world of the living.\"'Bessie,'Annie calls to a dark-skinned field negro she\u2019s trying to train to be light. Light, \u2019cause most housework done by the offspring of the raped: mixed-raced and birthed out of broken wombs. \u201cBessie,\u201d Annie say again, this time with her voice raised. She steps in front of Bessie and puts her hand near Bessie\u2019s neck. The touching makes Bessie shiver like a wet dog, drenched\u2014a common condition for older slaves that Annie buys new. They must have never been shown mercy.\" It is this type of prose that really makes the reader feel the characters.Not only is the feeling authentic, there are nuggets of wisdom weaved into the story and though the novel stretches over a number of years the reader will never feel disconnected. \"It's been said that justice is getting what you deserve. And mercy is not getting the bad you deserve. Grace is getting a good thing, even when you don't deserve it. So if I would've named my good thing, I'd have called her Grace. But someone else named her Josephine.\" That comes from spirit Naomi narrating about the flashes she experiences. This is the kind of book that will have readers reflecting on the knowledge they have, or lack thereof, about the terror of a woman's life lived under slavery, both official and outlawed. The violence, ever present, the lack of ownership of one's own body. The vessel for all kinds of deviant thoughts, from white men. Ms. Deon will make you feel all of that, and if you are not touched, you need to check your pulse. There is no way you leave this book without feeling something. As an addendum, I have noticed the novel \"Homegoing\" being hailed as one of the best books this year and it is already appearing on many best lists and being widely promoted and deemed a must read. I read it, thought it was good and gave it four stars. However, this Grace doesn't take a backseat to that book and if you read both of these novels, you will understand how and why certain books get pushed as best this, must read, etc., while other books languish in search of readers.

The only reason I can't round it up was this. For me, I consistently was pulled out of the chronology of the story and narrator identity question to the point that I could not connote. There was a section, nearly exactly in the middle which became so confusing to me that after a reread, I still couldn't place it and so soldiered on. The beginning was stunning. And carries the intense violence that so much of the remaining placements also evidence. And the ending was breath-holding too. So I do understand and I did get full cognition for the \"voice\" of the presence who is like the title suggests a \"grace\" unseen but in full activation.My problem with a book that has these many characters and in which so many of them are either violently evil or despicably duplicitous is that the level of numbing disconnection occurs. For most people it is nearly the opposite. But in this case, some of these characters! Like Cynthia, for instance. Not that a crazy Jewish Madam and prostitute would be unheard of in the antebellum South- but I never really \"got\" any of her motivations. All kinds of issues like that one. These characters seem extreme of the extreme. And the horrors of the slavery system very real too. So one doesn't particularly equate to the other. Hard to explain. But all of it felt in the middle half, more like a puzzle I needed to constantly figure out than a tale I could encompass within. Strong women indeed. And the language was authentic and above the bar for written expression. The \"eyes\" of the overseeing narrator was extremely original and a 5 star technique to equate the precise feelings or sufferings. It was a way to convey connection within the women's personalities. That was awesome in its application. But with all the time switching, I couldn't grab continuity for it. This is not a fun book to read. It's horror in treatment and outcomes. Its violence quotient overwhelmed me at times. And in large sections depicts terrible and supreme and repeating degradation. Way too real in the observation of suffering to say it was enjoyment in the reading of it.This book gives men, all around as a group, very few tolerable qualities. And there were a few times that I was taken aback at a spot of revisionist \"thought\". For instance, one of our strong protagonists noted that the clothes for women in that heat were entrapment devised by men and their onus. I could be wrong, but I don't believe slaves or plantation mistresses (either)would connote that way in 1847 or 1862.Gird your loins for pain if you want to immerse in this era Alabama."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32535119-michelle", "userReview": "\u201cJustice is getting what you deserve. And mercy is not getting the bad you deserve. Grace is getting a good thing, even when you don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\nGrace is an emotionally gripping novel. Set in the antebellum South through the Civil War and the early days of emancipation, it touches on the woman as captive. Not just in the literal sense but in the figurative sense as well. Though the novel focuses on the narrator Naomi and her daughter, Cynthia, the Jewish madam and Annie, the abandoned wife of a plantation owner also have their own crosses to bear. \n\u201cWe\u2019re all born empty.

But for these needy bodies, almost anything will do.\u201d\nA poetic tribute with many rich layers of meaning, Grace is narrated by the spirit of Naomi. Using this literary device, the novel is told in flashes over the course of both Naomi\u2019s life and memorable, if sometimes, horrific moments of Josey\u2019s. \n\u201cSome say your life flashes before your eyes when you\u2019re about to die . . . It\u2019s more than just seeing the moment, it\u2019s taking part in the memory as if it were happening again.

It is easy to get swept away into this story. I found it hard to put the book down even for moments at a time.

Lots of beautiful prose and an interesting premise about a young runaway slave, Naomi, who finds a new home in a brothel run by an eccentric unstable white woman. Naomi is killed after giving birth to Josey, a very light baby, who upon her mother\u2019s death, is passed around on a plantation, from the owners who initially want to raise her as their own because they think she is white, to a Black male slave who becomes her \u201cfather\u201d. There were lots of beautiful passages, and the story was different from anything I\u2019ve read about slavery, especially once you read of how and why Naomi ran away to the brothel (no spoilers here but it\u2019s not something that can be easily figured out, and it\u2019s somewhat badass). And I think that is the strongest selling point of this book outside of the beautiful cover: it tells a very uncommon and unconventional story based in slavery. But there are huge issues with this novel that made it hard for me to enjoy. The story is told in alternating time periods: one chapter is Naomi\u2019s story of running away and piecing together a life within the brothel and among the crazy characters who frequent the neighboring saloon. The next chapter is Naomi, as a ghost/spirit, following Josey as she grows up and deals with her own tragedy and misfortune as a result of plantation life during the Civil War. Both stories were riveting but I couldn\u2019t understand why the author told them through alternating chapters when it could have easily been told chronologically. It was confusing, especially with the narrator jumping from \u201creal time\u201d to \u201cspirit time\u201d. The continued switching consistently threw me out of the story and in some parts, made me angry because it did nothing to enhance the reader's experience. Also, the two stories were so different that they could have almost been two entirely different novels. And having half of it told by a main character after she\u2019d been killed was an odd storytelling device that could have fared better with an explanation.The novel also did not feel like historical fiction. From the dialogue, especially the cursing, to how the story progressed, I didn\u2019t feel immersed in the time period. Outside of being reminded by dates and the treatment of women and Black people, this felt like a modern story.Due to the alternating stories, there were two endings and both were suspenseful, heart wrenching, and true page turners. These riveting endings kinda made up for the issues that I had with earlier parts of the book, but not enough to give it a high rating. I hovered between 2.5 and 3 stars, and decided to round up to 3 because I love the cover.This is not your typical novel about slavery, so if you're looking for something different, and you don't mind alternating story lines that throw you in and out of the story, you might want to give this one a try."}, {"userName": "Nnenna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8256027-nnenna", "userReview": "This book is excellent and I feel like there aren\u2019t enough people talking about how good it is.

Naomi dies that night, but she doesn\u2019t quite move on. Instead, she reflects on her experiences before her death, and those of her daughter after her death.Deon wrote this story beautifully and Naomi was such a rich character. She has a heartbreaking life. I think the idea of having a dead narrator could easily go wrong, but it works really well in this novel. The helplessness and lack of control that Naomi experiences in her life is also reflected after her death.

I run the risk of being labeled \"hard to please\" or \"never satisfied\"; certainly I am legitimately accused of being very analytic and detail-oriented. So be it. However I find myself especially frustrated when a book with great ideas and lots of potential fails largely because of sloppy content and poor internal validity. \"Grace: A Novel\" is a good example.Others have generally criticized this novel for three reasons: The perpetually foul-mouthed dialogue, the back-and-forth plot development, and the violence that permeates it from start to finish. For the record none of these things put me off. I did find that many of the profanities were not in use during the time in which this tale is set (1838-1869) and that rankles. \"Bumfucker\", \"tits\", and \"pussy\" were not used in American language in this manner until the 1960s, 1928, and 1878, respectively. (I'm also pretty sure men did not say \"Fuck me!\" 170 years ago when they were irritated.). How do I know? Because I did a little research. It didn't take long. And, while I may not be entirely correct in all specifics, I seem to have done a bit more critical thinking than Ms. Deon or her \"exceptional editor, Dan Smetanka\". Once I noticed these jarring inconsistencies, others began to surface with exasperating regularity. My initial leanings toward a 4 Star rating ultimately became a more reliable form of historical fiction than this book.I did not keep track of every instance of Alternative Fact, just those which were very clearly incorrect and therefore cheapened my experience. These won't disturb many readers but, had I known about them in advance, I would not have chosen to read this. They form a sad trail which leads from shaky ground to literary fault line. Veracity and trustworthiness in this text slowly vanish and are replaced by whatever must make for interesting moments in a screenplay. But this is not a screenplay (although I learned later it began as one); this is a publication Counterpoint Press advertise as a book. In that regard, I am less impressed.It's best if I just list some examples of what bothered me. Consider this my feeble attempt at keeping belabored whining to a minimum.Nobody in the antebellum South said \"been there, done that...\" This appears to have bubbled up in the 1970s.The term \"flatbread\" was not coined until Gladys Ford made such a product in Waitsfield, Vermont, half a century later. And no Mexican-American was describing their tortillas as \"flatbread\" in 1849.Folks were neither doing nor decribing \"the splits\" back then, either, although Can-Can dancers were performing such moves and calling them by other names. But not in Conyers, Georgia, or Tallasee, Alabama.There was no Scotch whiskey to speak of in the Deep South, and definitely no highly-prized Talisker stashed in slaves' quarters in 1848. American Bourbon was the rage and had been since the Revolutionary War. No company was importing liquor from Scotland through Civil War blockades. Talisker did build its first distillary in Scotland in 1831 but was apparently a failure at quality whiskey-making. So just about everything related to this plot detail is bunk.Women did not wear \"blouses\" or refer to them at the time of the novel because no such garment existed with that name (outside peasant villages in France) until long after this story ends.Households did not collect their refuse in \"trash-bags\" which were then tied up and hauled outside. And they did not throw out \"napkins\" left after a party as these were not disposable items. These would generally have been laundered and pressed. I did learn that paper was burned in the fireplace or woodstove, old garments and cloth that could not be rejuvenated were sold to the rag man, food items were composted or slopped for animals, and every other kind of garbage was thrown into the outhouse or a landfill site.\"Rigamortis\" is urban slang for getting an erection or being super down and out emotionally; \"Rigor mortis\" is what one actually calls the muscle-stiffening that develops hours after death.Albert continually refers to the unborn Josey as \"she\" and \"her\" even though nobody knows the sex of the baby and Naomi never describes having a sense of whether she is carrying a boy or girl. The reader has known for hundreds of pages, of course, but not the characters.Finally, the Deus ex machina appearance of Bobby Lee on his high horse to save the day did not work for me. Until that point I do think Deon successfully avoided the siren call of inserting moments of crazy coincidence in order to make her story \"interesting\", so I do want to give credit where it is due. Even so this particular plot twist beggared belief.Colson Whitehead's \"Underground Railroad\" manages to blend fanatasy with fact, history with fiction, in ways I found illuminating, enchanting, and revelational. With a more critical eye - and markedly better editing support - this could have been a much stronger novel. Natashia Deon seems to have very good instincts, remarkable imagination, an obvious devotion to her characters, and a drive to succeed as a writer. She has things to say and stories to tell. She has talent. I'd love to see what she can do with more reliable, objective, trustworthy guides at her disposal."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/780808-pam", "userReview": "What to say?

I\ufe0f am overwhelmed by the sadness of what happened then and am still saddened by our country now."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6244600-laurie", "userReview": "This is not a book that you will love or hate; It is a book that will effect you to your core.

My expectations were too high going into this book. I was super thrilled about a ghost narrating the story, but all that meant at almost halfway was we got one first person perspective and one third person perspective. A lost opportunity to explore aspects only a ghost could bring to a story. I didn't feel connected to the characters as individuals. It felt like a very standard slave narrative that ticked off the boxes of horrible things done to slaves. I'm not intrigued enough with the mysteryish parts to continue on. I'm super bummed. I thought I'd love this."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "I loved this novel. It is an example of what a female author can accomplish when she allows herself to write truly from her own heart and vision. I was already in ghost story mode from reading White Tears just before it. In Grace, the ghost who narrates the tale is the mother of the main character, Grace. Both are slaves. The ghost narrator's mother was also a slave upon whom her master kept producing babies as a way to get more slaves without having to pay for them. Except the woman kept having daughters when he wanted males for the fields.Thus we get the stories of three generations of slave women, of murder and mayhem, of desperate escapes towards freedom. I guess I have read enough slave narratives now to have become somewhat inured to the abuse and violence that come with the institution. The key to this novel is the unending strength of a mother's love for her children. Without sentimentality, Natashia Deon plums all the conflicting emotions and deeds done under the almost mystical connection a mother has with her offspring.This is a story of the heart complete with all the blood, pain, labor, and mistakes a mother can make. It is a story of the mind and all the conundrums of how to best rear and protect, especially daughters who are bound to become mothers themselves. Of course, ultimately it is an historical story of the suffering of females and slaves. There are also some wonderful male characters to counter-balance the depravity of the typical Southern \"gentlemen\" of the era.I listened to an interview with the author on the Other People podcast http://otherppl.com/natashia-deon-int.... She is a native of Los Angeles, her father was a cop, and she had amazing stories to tell about her life. She is also a Christian with the kind of deep faith I can respect. The line from the novel that moved me the most was, \"There is no justice. There is only grace.\"For fans of Toni Morrison, and I am one of them, it is as if she has a literary daughter whose name is Natashia Deon. In my opinion, Grace should have been a huge bestseller last year. There is no justice. It must have been grace that led me to such a wonderful novel."}, {"userName": "Laurene", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3628266-laurene", "userReview": "Just WOW! One of those \"what did I just read\". And this is a debut novel. Incredible Sometimes a book stays with me for a while. And this is why. \"If I could talk to Josey, I'd tell her to always enjoy the present. To live in it. I'd tell her about love, too. I'd tell her the love she has for this boy, she'll feel again. I'd tell her about real love. Tell her to not be fooled by what feels real. Tell her to get married like I never could. Tell her to marry someone who's kind. I'd tell her to make herself kinder by learning to care for people with bad attitudes and nothing to offer 'cause the kindness she measures to others will be measured back to her. I'd tell her that in the end, we'll all need somebody to take care of us, if we live long enough. If we get old. That's when it'll matter most. When we're living the consequences of our old yeses and nos. And if you're lucky, I'd tell her, your caregiver will be your own spouse because you'd have paid for that privilege with your commitment.

Naomi is the narrator throughout the entire book. It is through her voice that we learn of the death of her mother and the black man her sister Hazel was going to marry named James. They are both murdered in cold blood at the hands of the Master and his helper of the plantation. Naomi, who is only fifteen at the time is forced to go on the run and leave home because of the retribution that would be brought on her for stabbing and killing the Master with a fire poker.Naomi is found unconscious forty miles away by a woman named Cynthia who nurses Naomi back to health at her brothel. At the same time an alternate story is told by Naomi as she has been killed and is looking down, hovering and watching her daughter Joshie born and saved by a sympathetic man and brought to a white woman who owns the land and plantation named Annie. Naomi watches Joshie grow up and tries to keep her safe. Joshie grows up and has two children with Jackson who goes off to fight in the war and then returns.My thoughts about this novel are that while the universal themes are not original and have been told many times before, that this was an interesting novel with individual character's with their own personal experiences to tell. I feel that there was sadly a lot of violence and that the African American's both slaves and free people were horribly mistreated. This has been told before as well. I did enjoy reading this novel and would recommend it to those who are interested in the plight of the time in history while African American's were trying to survive from day to day the disparate inequalities in living and the unfair tragedies visited upon them just because they were not of white ethnicity. Grace is the story of how Naomi tries to survive during these turbulent times and how she fights to protect her daughter and grandchildren from the terrible atrocities taking place during this era."}, {"userName": "Trudy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2471697-trudy", "userReview": "Finished and I am both emotionally exhausted and spiritually uplifted! The backdrop of this story is mainly during the 1840's, in the south, amidst slavery, the Civil War, and its aftermath. There was quite a host of characters and many mini storylines. At times, it was a little challenging for me to keep track of who was who. However, Natasha Deon did not leave any stones unturned as she penned each character's life, both prominent and brief. The main character, however, was a runaway slave woman named Naomi and the story is told by alternating chapters of her voice and those of the other characters. At times this book was just heart wrenching as the author presented some of the horrors of slave life and I was tempted to stop reading. However, I forced myself to push through and continue reading because, as devastating as it is to read, this was the reality of my ancestors and it's important for us acknowledge this time in the history of our country.Ultimately, this book is about incredible bravery and unconditional love and commitment. 4.5 Stars, bumped up to 5 because of the author's apparent herculean work in creating this story.

She tells her own story and that of her daughter. For the most part, they are in different chapters (in the audio, they are introduced by the date and place) until the very end when it switches in what in audio seems like paragraph by paragraph as the suspense builds. While we know what happened to the ghost (she is killed at the beginning of the book), what happened that lead to the young, pregnant Naomi to run be running through the woods is not heard until the end.Naomi is a slave. Her story starts with her and her sister in the back room of the 2-room slave cabin while in the front room the master is watching a male slave have sex with the girls mother. The master tells her he needs her to have a boy because they bring more money than the females she keeps having. Eventually, Naomi runs North but doesn't get but to Georgia when she is found by a free black - Albert (later called Charles) - in the woods. She is burning up with fever. Albert takes her to the brothel run by Cynthia and Cynthia, one strange woman, takes care of her. Naomi cleans the brothel for her keep. But she gets sweet talked by the white piano player (who is addicted to gambling) and believes him when he tells her they will go to Boston, get married, and have babies. Of course, that doesn't happen. Jeremy bolts and then Naomi realizes she is pregnant.In the meantime, the Naomi ghost is watching her daughter - Josie - grow up. Charles brings Josie up, after the plantation owner learns out that the white girl (Josie takes after Jeremy not Naomi) his wife told him was their daughter. Then Josie is secretly abused by the brother-in-law (George) of the plantation owner. George disappears for many years. Josie struggles with mental illness. She marries. Her husband Jackson leaves to join the army to fight the Indians when she is six or seven months pregnant. She has twins. George returns. Jackson returns. Shit happens.

None of its women do have the same strong.
