I understand the appeal of war much more now. It's nothing to do with altruism and everything to do with an uber-boy's club, guns and adrenaline. I understand men a lot more now too. This book should be required reading for the parents and girlfriends of the young men who have enlisted in the military. It isn't what anyone would actually want to hear - no one much cares about the political reasons for prosecuting the war, everyone likes firing guns at the enemy. It's like watching half a dozen nine year old boys with cap guns dodging around trees, throwing themselves on the ground, pretending to be dead, not capturing anyone, just shooting, and kids shouting out 'no fair' and getting shot anyway (here, all the other boys laugh). Its just like that, only ten years later and with real ammunition. War will never end when it provides thrills like that."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "Stripped to its essence, combat is a series of quick decisions and rather precise actions carried out in concert with ten or twelve other men. In that sense it\u2019s much more like football than, say, like a gang fight. The unit that choreographs their actions best usually wins. They might take casualties, but they win. The choreography\u2014you lay down fire while I run forward, then I cover you while you move your team up\u2014is so powerful that it can overcome enormous tactical deficits. There is a choreography for storming Omaha Beach, for taking out a pillbox bunker, and for surviving an L-shaped ambush at night on the Gatigal. The choreography always requires that each man make decisions based not on what\u2019s best for him, but on what\u2019s best for the group. If everyone does that, most of the group survives. If no one does, most of the group dies. That, in essence, is combat.\nThe story here has nothing to do with politics, macro foreign policy, or terrorism, per se. Junger looks at the experience of a small band of soldiers at the front lines of the war in Afghanistan, in the eastern reaches, in a valley notorious for its peril to combatants. What matters here are the mechanisms, physical and emotional, that bind the soldiers to one another. What they consider funny, what topics are off limits, how they rely on each other, criticize each other, support each other, how they cope with or thrive on the reality of war. Sebastian Junger - image from Popmatters.comThis book is as much a look at war through the lenses of psychology and anthropology as it is a portrait of front-line combat. A quick look at the Sources and References, rich with articles from publications like Neurocardiology Letters, American Psychological Association Monitor, Gerontologist, Proceedings of this and that, shows that there is far more going in War than adrenaline, blood, and bullets. Not only does Junger examine the significance of group interactions among company members, but looks to what the roots of this construction might be in the development of homo sapiens as a species. He looks at how group cohesion and situational preparation affect fear, and how, for some, war is less a horror to be avoided and forgotten than the pinnacle of one\u2019s existence. A scene from the film RestrepoThe book is divided into three sections, Fear, Killing, and Love. The first is predominantly a familiar sort of war reportage, well done, but nothing new. The latter sections look beyond the obvious and get into some very interesting material. War is a very smart book that will take you places you might not expect to go.

But whatever it is they imagine combat to be, it isn\u2019t this - the unremitting discomfort of heat, fleas, and filth; the obvious futility of all their efforts to do a job which is impossible; the unrecognized stress of being a continual target of bullets from the enemy, hate and suspicion from the local populace, and disdain by their superiors; the inevitable incompetence of those in command of a situation which they never comprehend; and the knowledge that the experience of numbness one is undergoing is fundamentally incommunicable to anyone who isn\u2019t sharing it.But young men seem never to get the eternally recurring message: This experience is likely to damage you beyond repair; it will haunt you and be the source of life-long regret. If you survive it with your body intact, your mind will have absorbed not just your own pain and degradation, but that of your friends and perhaps even your enemies. This pain and degradation will not make you a better man; it will make you an invalid. As Junger reports: \u201cBy the time the tour was over, half of Battle Company was supposedly on psychiatric meds.\u201dThe further one is from those who are shot at and shoot back to kill, the more fantasy takes hold. Of course, the majority of a military force never actually know what\u2019s going on: \u201cNearly a fifth of the combat experienced by the 70,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan is being fought by the 150 men of Battle Company.\u201d One need not go far up the chain of command to get the point: \u201cIt\u2019s only on rear bases that you hear any belligerent talk about patriotism or religion.\u201d Senior officers, faced with the unfamiliar, are at best incompetent and at worst seriously deluded: \u201c...the war also diverged from the textbooks because it was fought in such axle-breaking, helicopter-crashing, spirit-killing, mind-bending terrain that few military plans survive intact for even an hour.\u201dThe laws of unintended consequences constitute the unchanging physics of war. War is the only demonstrable perpetual motion machine as it creates the conditions necessary for its continuance: \u201c...war came to the Korengal when timber traders from a northern faction of the Safi tribe allied themselves with the first U.S. Special Forces that came through the area in early 2002. When the Americans tried to enter the Korengal they met resistance from local timber cutters who realized that the northern Safis were poised to take over their operation... For both sides, the battle for the Korengal developed a logic of its own that sucked in more and more resources and lives until neither side could afford to walk away.\u201dFrankly I am exhausted hearing the old shibboleths about war evoking the best human traits of compassion, self-sacrifice, courage, and solidarity. Junger has a familiar anecdote: \u201cMoreno put his hands on him and started to pull him out of the gunfire. A Third Squad team leader named Hijar ran forward to help, and he and Moreno managed to drag Guttie behind cover before anyone got hit. By that time the medic, Doc Old, had gotten to them and was kneeling in the dirt trying to figure out how badly Guttie was hurt. Later I asked Hijar whether he had felt any hesitation before running out there. \u2018No,\u2019 Hijar said, \u2018he\u2019d do that for me. Knowing that is the only thing that makes any of this possible.\u2019\u201dExactly. It is the intense caring for each other by soldiers in combat that makes the whole enterprise of war possible. The entire complex machine of the military has been geared to generate and to exploit this fundamental force of fellow-feeling among men who come largely from the margins of society and who have no clue about the process to which they\u2019re being subjected. Indoctrination is the official term; brainwashing is the more accurate. To me this is at least as obscene as the violence that it permits. This is the open secret of all armies everywhere. It is also a source of immense guilt, regret, and psychosis among those who are its product. By distorting and intensifying the natural sympathy among men, the military creates zombies who are emotionally neither dead nor alive.Is it too much to hope that, despite their hormonal disturbances, someday young men who are encouraged to wage war will tell the old men who insist on war to fuck off?"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "This book was a gripping and moving read for me. Junger renders an account of the experience a platoon stationed at a remote outpost in northern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border. He calls it \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d in the war effort because the units stationed in this mountain valley, the Korengal, saw more continuous fighting than elsewhere in the war. Junger was physically embedded with these men for five one-month periods between 2007 and 2008, and he was clearly emotionally embedded too. This was a dangerous work, as he was exposed to near misses from rifle shots and mortar rounds at camp and on aggressive patrols and was subject to an IED attack of his vehicle on a convoy run. The experience allowed him to capture significant insights on the ability of soldiers in combat to harness the \u201cband of brothers\u201d mentality and surmount fears and work effectively as a team in the face of intense dangers. Firebase Restopo. Named after a beloved medic who died, the base served to prevent use of the valley for staging attacks on the nearby the Pech River Valley, where a larger effort was devoted to efforts of preventing Taliban insurgents and arms from entering the country. This slice of life of one platoon of 20 in the Battle Company of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team reveals a lot about war in general and the special features on this particular war. The difficult terrain and logistical challenges of this area contributed to the inability of Alexander, the British, and Soviets to subdue the region. All the advanced technology the Americans could put at play here, Apache helicopter gunships, Stealth bombers, advanced artillery, and unmanned drones, could not dispel the need for soldiers in place to intercede with the passage of Taliban forces from Pakistan and to work to win over the hearts and minds of local Pashtun populations needed to support them. As American citizens who put these young men in harm\u2019s way, we owe it to them to honor their sacrifice and learn more about their efforts. This book, as well as the documentary \u201cRestopo\u201d and recently released \u201cKorengal\u201d that Junger produced with Tim Hetherington, are monumental achievements in fulfilling that need:Combat was a game that the United States had asked Second Platoon to become very good at, and once they had, the United States had put them on a hilltop without women, hot food, running water, communication with the outside world, or any kind of entertainment for over a year. Not that men were complaining, but that sort of thing has consequences. . In a every crude sense the job of young men is to undertake the work that their fathers are too old for, and the current generation of American fathers has decided that a certain six-mile long valley in Kunar Province needs to be brought under military control.\u2026Nearly fifty American soldiers have died carrying out those orders. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a lot or a little, but the cost does need to be acknowledged. Soldiers themselves are reluctant to evaluate the costs of war (for some reason, the closer you are to combat the less inclined you are to question it), but someone must. That evaluation, ongoing and unadulterated by politics, may be the one thing a country absolutely owes the soldiers who defend its borders.Junger strives hard to be objective, but he can\u2019t help identifying with the soldiers. He earned their respect and was paid with honesty. He found they all wanted to be there. He was subject to no censorship in any way. He makes a point of the difference from the situation with the Vietnam War:Vietnam was considered a morally dubious war that was fought by draftees while the rest of the nation was dropping acid and listening to Jimi Hendrix. Afghanistan, on the other hand, was being fought by volunteers who more or less respected their commanders and had the gratitude of the vast majority of Americans back home. If you imagined that your job, as a reporter, was to buddy up to the troops and tell the \u201creal\u201d story of how they were dying in a senseless war, you were in for a surprise. The commanders would realize would realize you were operating off a particular kind of cultural programming and would try to change your mind, but the men wouldn\u2019t bother. They\u2019d just refuse to talk to you until you left their base.Junger takes pains to explain how ideology or motivation for manly glory plays no part in accounting for why the men here achieved what is judged as courage. What Junger witnessed, backed up by historical studies, confirms that debilitating fear happens less when the soldier has a sense of active control or choice in his fate, even when objectively the danger is high. Conversely, the random risk associated with roadway IEDs defeat these advantages, and all one\u2019s skills mean nothing. Love for his fellow soldier is the most potent factor in his view to account for why so many are willing to risk their own safety and lives to come to the aid of another in trouble. What he saw and what he shares from research reveals how most PTSD outcomes arise from the experience of the injury or death of a platoon mate rather than threats or injury to himself. The Army might screw you and your girlfriend might dump you and the enemy might kill you, but the shared commitment to safeguard one another\u2019s lives is unnegotiable and only deepens wit time. The willingness to die for another person is a form of love that even religions fail to inspire, and the experience of it changes the person profoundly. What the Army sociologists, with their clipboards and their questions and their endless meta-analyses, slowly came to understand was that courage was love. In war, neither could exist without the other, and in a sense they were just different ways of saying the same thing. Junger\u2019s reporting makes these capabilities to act in ways contrary to drives for individual survival come powerfully alive. In interludes, he explains well the history of these ideas. He also pauses in the high-octane narrative to provide useful summaries on human physiology of soldiers in combat. From training and personality, some excel in this business of killing and avoiding being killed. Junger identifies the scope of the addictive jolt and secret pleasures many soldiers experience in this work. There is some sense of potency in the rush of success at riding the wave on the cusp of death and surviving:War is supposed to feel bad because undeniably bad things happen in it, but for a nineteen-year old at the working end of a .50 cal during a firefight that everyone comes out of okay, war is life multiplied by some number that no one has ever heard of. In some ways twenty minutes of combat is more life than you could scrape together in a lifetime of doing something else. Combat isn\u2019t were you might die\u2014though that does happen\u2014it\u2019s where you find out whether you get to keep on living.These guys are the ones who have trouble accommodating to the mundane concerns civilian life, where success takes more cumbersome efforts. They are the ones who re-enlist for a job they know they can do well, achieve a special sense of belonging, and reap the thrills of effective action. Junger looks at the details of the brave and resourceful actions of Staff Sergeant Giunta who was awarded a Medal of Honor in 2010. Under a well executed enemy ambush that split his platoon and killed two, Giunta raced into a hail of bullets to retrieve an injured man and coordinated a critical reuniting of their forces. As President Obama notes at the award ceremony, Giunta echoes Audie Murphy from World War 2 in stating that he didn\u2019t do anything special and that he was just doing his job to assure that fallen comrade was not left behind. To probe deeper for the how and why of this capacity, Junger constantly walks the boundaries between seeing the affinity of some men for combat in pathological terms such as addiction and accounting for it as something tied in with core characteristics in human nature. Collective defense can be so compelling\u2014so addictive, in fact\u2014that eventually it becomes the rationale for why the group exists in the first place. I think almost every man at Restopo secretly hoped the enemy would make a serious try at overrunning the place before the deployment came to an end. It was everyone\u2019s worst nightmare but also the thing they hoped for most, some ultimate demonstration of the bond and fighting ability of the men.He would have done better to leave it there. It is fair to speculate a bit on linkages to the natural systems of reward in the brain, but his trying to explain the motivations for combat to dopamine systems is a circular explanation that adds nothing to understanding in my view. And to point toward a likely evolutionary basis in brain wiring for collective defense to the point of suicidal action went too far in leaving the impression there is consensus on war and humans as killer apes in being biologically determined. There is plenty of innovative achievement in this book in its elucidation of men in combat without reaching for dubious \u201cultimate\u201d explanations.Sebastian Junger"}, {"userName": "Buck", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1450485-buck", "userReview": "Another reviewer on here said wryly that this book taught her a lot about men. A valid reaction, but it still made me wince. It\u2019s as if I were to say I\u2019d learned a lot about women from, like, The Devil Wears Prada or something. You want to jump up and shout, \u201cBut we\u2019re not all like that. Or if we are, we\u2019re not like that all the time.\u201dIn a way, though, War isn\u2019t a bad advertisement for what used to be called the masculine virtues. The men profiled here are incredibly brave, thrillingly competent and, within the confines of their unit, totally accountable. In other words, they\u2019re sort of what your dad was like before you got to know him better. Except that these guys are twenty-year-old kids, for the most part. In that respect, the book is also a pretty good advertisement for the US army, which, say what you will, still knows how to turn borderline delinquents into very fine soldiers. Of course, there\u2019s a big OTOH looming here. If the army straightened these young men out to some extent\u2014many were just a drinking binge away from prison when they signed up\u201415 months in a combat zone, amid a tiny, inward-looking fraternity, has pretty much ruined them for anything else. Most of them are smart and self-aware enough to realize this, but helpless to do anything about it.Maybe the scariest insight provided by War isn\u2019t that combat is horrific\u2014we already knew that\u2014but that it\u2019s dangerously seductive. Deep down, many soldiers simply love to fight. Well, \u201csimply\u201d is the wrong word: there\u2019s a ton of fear and guilt mixed in, but like any twisted relationship, this one's based on a perverse attraction. As Junger puts it:War is a big and sprawling word that brings a lot of human suffering into the conversation, but combat is different. Combat is the smaller game that young men fall in love with, and any solution to the human problem of war will have to take into account the psyches of these young men\u2026These hillsides of loose shale and holly trees are where the men feel not most alive\u2014that you can get skydiving\u2014but the most utilized. The most necessary. The most clear and certain and purposeful. If young men could get that feeling at home, no one would ever want to go to war again, but they can\u2019t.Speaking as a formerly young man, I think that's a pretty astute observation. Then again, I\u2019ve never fired a shot in anger with anything more powerful than a squirt gun, so what do I know?I hate to get all effete and artsy-fartsy about such a manly book, but War does have one or two aesthetic shortcomings. I came to it fresh from Rebecca West\u2019s Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, which is basically the K2 of literary non-fiction, so I was sometimes frustrated by Junger\u2019s pedestrian prose, which goes hand with his journalistic matter-of-factness. There\u2019s nothing wrong with journalism\u2014and only a truly hardcore journalist would even consider spending a year in the shittiest shithole in all of Afghanistan\u2014but I can\u2019t help wondering what a Rebecca West or, better yet, a DFW would\u2019ve done with this material. Granted, the result would\u2019ve been a 1000-page behemoth replete with footnotes and obsessive ruminations on PCV tubing or whatever, but it just might have represented some kind of definitive summa of our times. One more thing. It may or may not be relevant, but my mom just borrowed War from me. This is alarming for a number of reasons, none of which I'll go into now. She thinks it's pretty cool, in case you're wondering. I kinda doubt she\u2019s looking for a \u201cdefinitive summa of our times\u201d, though, so take that into account."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene", "userReview": "This incredible piece of journalism, written by Sebastian Junger, should be read by each and every citizen. Mr. Junger spent 15 months with a platoon whose base was in a remote area of eastern Afghanistan, known as the Korengal Valley. The base was known as the Korengal Outpost (KOP). Mr. Junger's investigative piece was written for Vanity Fair magazine. I did not want to inject my personal or political opinions into this review; however, I've come to the conclusion that my personal and political opinions and feelings are inseparable from who I am, and how I ultimately felt about this book stemmed directly from those feelings and opinions. Mr. Junger, however was not so biased... he reported exactly what he saw, experienced and what this group of soldiers related to him in the period of time in which he was embedded with them. There were several parts to this book. One part dealt with the mechanics of war... all of the military terminology, weaponry,ammunition and all the logistics associated with warfare. Mr. Junger was very thorough... he described everything from hand grenades to M4 assault rifles that fired 203s... bullets that explode on impact and travel at the rate of 2,000 mph. Mr. Junger also provided many physics lessons throughout this book... explaining that these particular bullets travel faster than the speed of sound so the gunshot actually arrives a full second before it can be heard by the human ear. He provided geography lessons about the terrain of Afghanistan. The topography is brutal and rugged and reading about it explained why no military power dating back to Alexander the Great has ever been able to get a foothold in this country.The parts of this book that were most interesting to me though are the sociological and psychological aspects of war.. the psychology of a soldier. Mr. Junger talked about and followed closely this particular small group of soldiers and what struck me is that the personal and character qualities that make a good soldier do not necessarily make a good law-abiding citizen. These men spend months (and sometimes years) living with adrenaline rushes, fear and even complete boredom. It seemed to me , through the interviews Mr.Junger did with these particular soldiers, that a person cannot, over a long period of time, continue on this continuum of extreme emotions without lasting psychological effects. The most startling aspect of Mr. Junger's book was to read his conclusion... which he arrived at through his interviews of the soldiers themselves after they had returned home. He writes..\" Civilians balk at recognizing that one of the most traumatic things about combat is having to give it up. Throughout history, men have come home to find themselves desperately missing what should have been the worst experience of their lives. To a combat vet, the civilian world can seem frivolous and dull, with very little at stake.\" I really thought about this statement and although at first, it seemed strange, it began to actually make some sense. Through Mr. Junger's writing, it became clear to me that what happens between these people is the development of a 'brotherhood'.... an intimacy... that cannot possibly be replicated in civilian life. These soldiers rely on each other to simply stay alive.. which is probably one of the most profound things human beings can experience.I found this book to be very illuminating and it provided a lot of insight I was looking for into the social dynamics that occur among soldiers in combat. What Mr. Junger's book also provided was, I believe, a wake up call to all citizens and the politicians who seem to so casually send these awe-inspiring human beings to war. We all need to really be aware of and try to understand the effects that war has on these soldiers. It is obvious to me, that these men and women need support for their very special needs when they return home. And it is our duty and responsibility to no longer turn a blind eye to these needs. 'Thank you for your service' is a nice sentiment but is not nearly enough."}, {"userName": "warren Cassell", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2796172-warren-cassell", "userReview": "This is a phenomenal book and should be required reading for all the knee jerk liberals like me who have had nothing but disdain for the military. What impressed Junger the most during his several months series of embedments with the US army in Afghanistan was the closeness of the men in his units. These soldiers didn't talk about bringing democracy to Afghanistan or any other political or social raison d'etre for their being in what could be described as a Hell on earth. Their only goal was to protect each other from dying even at the risk of dying themselves. This was the theme throughout the book and fortunately, Junger is better at describing what he lived through than I am at summarizing what he wrote. He recounts being with a sixteen man unit in the Taliban infested mountains of Afghanistan under unbelievable conditions. Most of the time, there was one hundred degree plus heat, travel for miles on foot with 75-100 pounds on your back, very few showers, no hot meals and little sleep. This was all in addition to Taliban fighters trying to kill you at any opportunity. There was an adrenaline high for the soldiers involved in combat and always the fear that you might let down one of your comrades and be responsible for his death. There was a great deal of war in War, but Junger does more than bloody battles and provides an enlightening account of backgrounds and psychological make-up of the men he served with as well as history, geography, tactics, weapons resulting in a spellbinding book which, ironically, I finished on Memorial Day."}, {"userName": "Micheal", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3012365-micheal", "userReview": "I am constantly asking myself why I am so fascinated with the detailed accounts of combat. I don't have an answer. Since I was a boy I devoured memoirs of the Vietnam experience and todays accounts of Iraq and Afghanistan draw my interest in the same manner. Having never experienced combat I still wonder how it looks, smells, sounds.... books can communicate all that, but not how it really feels. Some come close, and Jungers book comes as close as I think is possible. So close that I didn't come away stimulated and entertained, but worn out, frustrated, sad and angry. Still, it's a great book and I highly recommend it.  If you follow the headlines then you may know that the Korengal Valley, the setting in WAR, has been abandoned by US forces after five years of bloody fighting. With that in mind what is relayed in the book becomes that much more heartbreaking. The sacrifice of the young Americans, and the unknown trials of the men they're fighting becomes void of meaning and just another exercise in mans inhumanity to man. Young men growing so callous about killing, and even relishing in seeing another man blown apart is of concern. The lack of respect for property and another's way of life is troubling.  I liked the segments about the brotherhood that develops among the soldiers and Jungers analysis drawing on decades of research from many sources about how and why that occurs. The psychology and motivation of human beings at war was fascinating and enlightening I watched the Sebastian Junger/Tim Hetherington documentary RESTREPO (a video diary of the same story) the day after I finished WAR.

Written by Sabastian Junger (of The Perfect Storm fame) In WAR he spends 15 months following a single platoon based at a remote outpost in Eastern Afghanistan. His objective is simple, to convey what soldiers experience, what war actually feels like. Divided into 3 \u201cbooks\u201d: Fear, Killing, and Love from the very first pages you are dropped right onto into the thick of it. Arriving on a remote hilltop in one of Afghanistan\u2019s most dangerous outposts in the Korengal Valley. Here Junger gives insight into the truths of combat, how these soldiers live and what they see. He describes things that few civilians will ever witness or go through; the fear, the anticipation, the honor and the trust among men. Their outpost is inaccessible, hot, hilly, remote and mortally dangerous. It\u2019s also home to (as I\u2019ve come to understand) the ultimate testosterone filled boys club.As with The Perfect Storm this is not so much a story or novel but a series of events (patrols/battles) tied together with the mechanics of war. How fast bullets travel, military strategy & history, studies on fear and courage and body armour. Lots of things you didn\u2019t know you wanted to know. Junger also manages to get some fairly intimate stories from the men; and you do get a feel for them as they describe what it means to fight, why they\u2019re serving, how they deal with boredom interspaced with sheer adrenaline, chaos and terror and how life will never be more pure or sharp than in that moment when there\u2019s a good chance that you could die.Between the sounds of gunfire and the agony of loss there are also some surprisingly funny moments, the jocularity and bromance of these guys who may not even like each other but would also die for their \u201cbrothers\u201d It is the ultimate commitment not so much to their job but to each other.Junger does spend some time (at the beginning and end) describing how the men are adjusting back to civilian life and I wish I could say something positive about that.WAR is gritty, raw, eye opening, funny, adrenaline charged, futile and heartfelt."}, {"userName": "LeeAnne", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4058534-leeanne", "userReview": "Sebastian Junger is the author of,\"The Perfect Storm\" and this book \"War\". His Oscar-nominated documentary \"Restrepo,\" won the 2010 grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Sebastian Junger spent 5 months in the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan, 25 miles from Pakistan border. The area is extremely isolated, rugged and mountainous terrain. The summers are blistering hot, the winters are ice cold. The valley is only 6 miles long but 70% of the bombs dropped in Afghanistan are dropped here and 42 American soldiers have died fighting here. It has been called \"The Valley of Death\" by American forces. There are 2 million American vets from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and 22 of those vets take their lives every single day. I\u2019ve often wondered why a soldier who has survived the horrors of combat, watched as his friends have gone home in body bags, does not get out of the military. Why do they reenlist? Junger illustrates why in this very perceptive, honest, non judgmental piece of journalism.What I found fascinating about this book was how the author was able to show the psychological effects of being in combat, not in a detached, clinical way, but in an expressive way so that a civilian like me can understand it.Junger describes battles where soldiers will run straight toward their deaths to try to save a comrade who has been wounded. Wounded men have been known to sneak away from the safety of hospitals to return to their buddies to help them, because, \u201cmy guys need me\u201d. The best performing units in combat are the ones where each soldier in that unit considers the survival of the group more important than the survival of the individual. When soldiers are in a high intensity combat situation they grow completely dependent on each other to stay alive. The cohesion that this dependence fosters is like no other bond in existence. These men feel so responsible for each other, if someone dies; they suffer debilitating survivors\u2019 guilt. It\u2019s not about the adrenalin rush and thrill of combat. One can get that from skydiving or other extreme sports. It is about feeling like an indispensible, valued member of a tribe. It is the most constructive they have ever felt in their lives. They know what their presence in that unit is a matter of life or death to guy standing next to him. If these guys could get that same feeling from a normal job at home, they would probably never go into battle again. The problem is, they can\u2019t get this at home. That combat psychology, that bond soldiers form when they are willing to lay down their life for another person, can\u2019t be duplicated anywhere else but in war. As the author puts it, \u201cThe willingness to die for another person is a form of love that even religions fail to inspire. The experience of brotherhood (not courage) changes some men so profoundly; they don\u2019t want to live life without it.\u201d When these same men return home, they feel an empty void where that feeling of \u201cbeing needed\u201d is absent. They miss it so much they are willing to return to the hell of war, risk life and limb, literally, to fill that emptiness. Not because they enjoy the thrill of being shot at, bombed and attacked. They miss the strong camaraderie and brotherhood that is such a unique side product of being in combat. It is something that can not be duplicated in any single way back in regular life, so these soldiers return again and again, and never leave. As Sebastian Junger puts it, \u201cMaybe the ultimate wound in combat, is the one that makes you miss the war you got it in.\u201d * RESTREPO: http://restrepothemovie.com/Restrepo is a 2010 American documentary film that plunges viewers into the experiences of soldiers on the front lines of the war in Afghanistan. It was directed by Sebastian Junger and late British/American photojournalist Tim Hetherington.

I bought the video-enriched Kindle version, which is also outstanding. Besides a map of the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan, included were clips from the documentary, 'Restrepo'. In the back of the book is a list of selected sources and references.The book chronicles a series of five visits by the author and Tim Hetherington, journalist-photographer, from 2007 to 2008, and subsequent events, to an Afghanistan outpost of infantry soldiers on a fourteen-month stay. Junger and Hetherington slept and ate with the men, and tagged along on patrols and visits to villages from the beginning of a thirty-man platoon's stay until they handed off the post to a new crew.The men were not interested in the political ramifications of the war or the concerns of the generals. The continuous fear of impending attack and the thrill of several battles had whittled the focus of the men down to one thing - the mutual commitment of every man to the safety of the other men in the platoon.While none of them believe they are brave warriors, I do. They love battle and they love their fellow soldiers. They endure slow quiet hours poorly, with nightmares and anxiety. The adrenaline rush of being a soldier in a firefight is why they do the job. Yet, they suffer tremendous griefs - losses of friends on the field and family back home. They know the risks of losing limbs and other body parts. They see men they consider family closer than brothers shot to pieces in front of them. They are aware of the emotional costs of fear and killing, and they know they will return home as different people, some of whom will never fit in again with ordinary life.I now have an idea of why volunteer soldiers go to war.

I found it to be an enjoyable read but the jumpy narrative was a bit off putting. I kept catching myself skimming paragraphs and some things that should have been explained or pointed out were left for the reader to figure out (like a dushka) whereas, things like mortars, which are pretty simple to understand and many people know what they are, were explained in more detail.I didn't find many of his theories very insightful as he used mostly psychological studies conducted by other people for his references. He tells us that the soldiers are masters of humour and yet from the dialogue he includes I can tell that there is much funnier material he could have added. The timeline jumps back and forth and it gets a bit confusing. As an embedded journalist I expected his insights to look a little deeper rather than telling us what we kind of already knew. Some paragraphs were beautifully composed and the structure was nice despite the timeline as he would begin by introducing the firefight from the first few shots and then cut off to tell the reader about some surveys and theories before continuing the firefight tale.I know that I am being very critical but I actually did enjoy reading this book and some features of the structure and composure I admired.

Many a veteran has tried to explain it to me but has been at a loss for words. Junger puts those e-motions, experiences, and mental and emotional chords together in words for those who've been through it and for those of us who have not but need to know what it's all about. This book was not political, not bias, it just proves what we've all seen for centuries as we've read and watched men give their lives for a a cause greater then themselves and for those serving with them.

Y lo hace viviendo con ellos, durmiendo como ellos, comiendo lo mismo que ellos, realizando las mismas marchas y expuesto a los mismos peligros. La \u00fanica diferencia es que durante esos meses, Junger no portaba un arma, sino una c\u00e1mara.\u00bfConsigue Junger su prop\u00f3sito? Supongo que s\u00ed. Desde luego, es imposible llegar a comprender qu\u00e9 se siente en esa situaci\u00f3n simplemente ley\u00e9ndolo... pero supongo que nos permite tener un cierto conocimiento de lo que experimentan estos hombres. Tambi\u00e9n nos permite comprender mucho mejor c\u00f3mo son estas guerras modernas en las que apenas hay un frente, en las que no se enfrentan ej\u00e9rcitos de la forma tradicional, sino que los combates se basan sobre todo en emboscadas y escaramuzas en las que un pu\u00f1ado de combatientes mal alimentados y mal vestidos son capaces de poner en jaque al ej\u00e9rcito m\u00e1s poderoso y tecnol\u00f3gicamente sofisticado del mundo. Claro que habr\u00eda que entender tambi\u00e9n qu\u00e9 es poner en jaque: porque hoy en d\u00eda, al contrario de lo que ocurr\u00eda en las guerras \"cl\u00e1sicas\", un combate en el que mueren 50 talibanes puede ser un \u00e9xito para estos si consiguen matar a un estadounidense y herir a otros dos. Hoy, las guerras son muy raras, aunque igual de absurdas que siempre.Como digo, el libro supongo que consigue su objetivo.

S\u00ed, eso probablemente ha influido, y quiz\u00e1s me habr\u00eda impresionado m\u00e1s si hubiera llegado a esta lectura m\u00e1s \"virgen\" en el tema. Pero adem\u00e1s de eso, creo que se alarga demasiado sin a\u00f1adir gran cosa.

O el intenso v\u00ednculo de camarader\u00eda que produce luchar juntos, y que provoca que uno est\u00e9 realmente dispuesto a morir no por defender una causa que generalmente les importa muy poco, sino por salvar a sus compa\u00f1eros de armas. El an\u00e1lisis de estos mecanismos psicol\u00f3gicos en el combatiente, y en c\u00f3mo muchas veces los convierte en incapaces de reinsertarse en una sociedad civil en la que es imposible experimentar esas sensaciones es, probablemente, lo m\u00e1s valioso de este libro.

This book is that real, that immediate. Junger follows the 173rd Airborne\u2019s Battle Company into the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. Next to the definition of Hell on Earth in the dictionary? That\u2019s the Korengal Valley. The weather (\u201cSummer grinds on: A hundred degrees every day and tarantulas invading the living quarters to get out of the heat.\u201d) and the terrain (\u201cThe last stretch is an absurdly steep climb through the village of Babiyal that the men call \u201cthe Stairmaster.\u201d\u201d) would have challenged Atilla the Hun, except that Atilla was smart enough not to invade Afghanistan.As if the weather and the terrain aren\u2019t bad enough, they\u2019re also fighting the culture. \u201cMost Korengalis have never left their village and have almost no understanding of the world beyond the mouth of the valley. That makes it a perfect place in which to base an insurgency dedicated to fighting outsiders. One old man in the valley thought the American soldiers were actually Russians who had simply stayed after the Soviet army pulled out in 1989.\u201dHow tough are these guys? \u201cBattle Company is taking the most contact of the battalion, and the battalion is taking the most contact - by far - of any in the U.S. military. Nearly a fifth of the combat experienced by the 70,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan is being fought by the 150 men of Battle Company. Seventy percent of the bombs dropped in Afghanistan are dropped in and around the Korengal Valley.\u201dGood thing they\u2019re tough, because everyone is shooting at them (\u201cThe bullet you dodge will pass you with a distinctive snap. That\u2019s the sound of a small object breaking the sound barrier inches from your head.\u201d). And that\u2019s just when they\u2019re staying \u201csafe\u201d (hah!) behind the wire of Restrepo, an outpost named for a medic who died in combat. \u201cRestrepo was extremely well liked because he was brave under fire and absolutely committed to the men. If you got sick he would take your guard shift; if you were depressed he\u2019d come to your hooch and play guitar.\u201dThis is an on the ground, eyewitness account of men at war, today, this minute, our guys in Afghanistan at work. The prose is clear and sharp and while Junger is inevitably a part of the story, he doesn\u2019t put himself forward too often and he never makes the mistake of thinking anything but the men of Battle Company are the subject.The larger subject is, of course, war, and Junger does go there later in the book. Armies have a vested interest in figuring out what makes a man fight and fight well, and Junger cities a lot of studies and makes a praiseworthy attempt at explaining why men fight. Testosterone and other hardwired biological stimuli come into it, as you knew they would, but that\u2019s not all there is to it. \u201cThe willingness to die for another person is a form of love that even religions fail to inspire, and the experience of it changes a person profoundly. What the Army sociologists, with their clipboards and their questions and their endless metanalyses, slowly came to understand was that courage was love.\u201dThe men of Battle Company love combat, and this book is as close as most people will get to understanding that. \u201cCivilians balk at recognizing that one of the most traumatic things about combat is having to give it up.\u201d But mostly?

Battle Company, 150 men, see 20% of the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. 150 men out of hundreds of thousands! This is because of the Korengal Valley, the most dangerous area in this region. The mountains border Pakistan and many of the Taliban fighters come across from Pakistan into Afghanistan. There are a number of things that strike you about the men in Battle Company. How they all come from disparate backgrounds for instance. One guy joins because he heard a radio advert while working in Subway, quit his job, and joined the army the next day. 6 months later here he is firing off machine gun rounds and calling down air strikes in a valley thousands of miles away! One man used to deal drugs in Reno, crossed some drug dealers, and joined the army to escape them. Another, perhaps the most interesting, O'Byrne, joined after being sent to reform school for taking the rap for his dad shooting him! The other thing that strikes you about them is their loyalty to one another. They really care about each other and look out for one another like nobody else, anywhere else. It's a close knit group that honours their dead and loyalty to their unit. Even when they're on leave, they race back to the front as they don't want to be responsible for not being there if one of them dies. When Doc Restrepo dies, their name the camp after him and fight the Taliban like animals, going out into the valley just to draw fire, then calling down Apaches to bomb the positions. The book is about the soldier's life in this valley and as such violence suffuses the book. From the numerous encounters with the enemy (often with Junger caught up in the middle), to the casualties they inflict and absorb, it is inescapable. One man grills cheesesteaks and then when he calls out that dinner's ready an RPG takes his arm off! One man is shot in his leg while asleep in his hammock - if he had been sleeping in his normal position the bullet would have gone in his head. When a new lieutenant joins the unit the men hold him down and beat him up. In any other part of the army this would be mutiny but here they do it to gauge his reaction - if he takes the punishment then they will listen and respect him; if he can't, he's failed the initiation. It's a brutal world these men live in and the stakes are high. Junger reports all of this with clarity and skill, knowing how to bring the reader into this barely recognisable world and making them understand how these men live day to day. It's fascinating, exciting, absorbing, and an utterly brilliant book, I can't recommend it higher."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james", "userReview": "One of the most powerful books I've read. The author does a superb job of capturing the atmosphere of an infantry platoon and the relationships of its members with each other as individuals and with the platoon as a whole throughout a brutal combat deployment lasting 15 months. To do so, he spent a great deal of that 15 months living with them, including accompanying them on combat missions in which he was nearly killed several times. This story was the basis for the award-winning National Geographic documentary \"Restrepo\", which Junger co-created with his colleague Tim Hetherington, who was also there with this platoon during this combat tour (Tim Hetherington later died covering the fighting in Libya during the revolt that ultimately led to the overthrow and killing of Muammar Gaddafi.)The book also describes the widely varying life experiences of a few of the soldiers pre-Army and post-Afghanistan. The aftermath of this combat tour was devastating for some who had been among the bravest, clearest-thinking, and most effective when they were actually under fire. If I could, I'd make this a mandatory reading assignment for all counselors, social workers, therapists, etc. who serve veterans."}, {"userName": "Bria", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8645320-bria", "userReview": "I don\u2019t want to diminish this book at all, especially since I love this author and it is well-written, but if you have any experience with military life it\u2019s a little boring.This would be a great novel to read if you never served in the military and are curious about the military and want to understand why someone would sacrifice their time, family and life to be a part of it.It was refreshing to read novel from a journalist that did not smash the military and, Junger actually tries to see the Soldiers\u2019 POV.Soldiers are proud of their country in a way that is not popular in the current media. They also represent violence, nationalism, imperialism and fear, which makes it hard for someone with no military experience to understand why we need a military and why the military does what it does.I highly recommend this book and others like it to anyone without military experience. It is essential that you understand where your safety to say and do as you please comes from. The military is the most diverse organization in America. We have people gaining their citizenship, people from other countries armies, and every skin color and religion in between. It unifies people who may otherwise never have met.

It's insanely exciting. The machinery of war and the sound it makes and the urgency of its use and the consequences of almost everything about it are the most exciting things anyone engaged in war will ever know. ...It's just not something that many people want acknowledged. War is supposed to feel bad because undeniably bad things happen in it, but for a nineteen-year-old at the working end of a .50 cal during a firefight that everyone comes of okay, war is life multiplied by some number that no one has ever heard of.\" (p. 144)With that paragraph, this reader found one of the themes neatly packaged that Junger explores in this account of the 15 months he spent embedded with a single platoon based at a remote Afghan outpost. Junger is a journalist, so he tells the story of war in this place, during a specific time. He details the horrendous conditions, the tensions with surrounding villages as the U.S. higher-ups try to carry out \"democracy-building,\" and the relationships between the men who are charged with that on-the-ground responsibility. Terrible, brutal things happen in war and since 9/11, Americans have largely been able to erase the reality of what's going on in Afghanistan from their collective minds. Unless, of course, they're actively serving or have family members or friends who are.Junger's account is thus not just a \"this-is-what-happened\" narrative. It's also a study of the men who ended up at this outpost, and what combat and war do them.\"To a combat vet, the civilian world can seem frivolous and dull, with very little at stake and all the wrong people in power. These men come home and quickly find themselves getting berated by a rear-base major who's never seen combat or arguing with their girlfriend about some domestic issue they don't even understand. When men say they miss combat, it's not that they actually miss getting shot at -- you'd have to be deranged -- it's that they miss being in a world where everything is important and nothing is taken for granted. They miss being in a world where human relations are entirely governed by whether you can trust the other person with your life.\" (p. 234)Too often, the idea of \"war\" gets grafted onto the American public's mind as something big and amorphous and you don't get a sense of the actual people caught up in it. That's what makes Junger's book so gripping. It's war distilled into one specific place with a platoon of specific men, so you learn something about them as people, and about what the constant stress of combat can create among them. Ironically, the horrific aspects of war serve to create seemingly otherworldly bonds between the men who fight it. War -- combat, specifically -- creates men (in this instance) who perform incredible, heroic feats for their brothers-in-arms, but who might have an extremely difficult time living outside of it. If they survive and make it back to the States, they may be walking wounded emotionally as well as physically. They can't replicate the intense bonds war forged for them outside of it, and as the second quote above notes, they miss a world where everything is important and where nothing is taken for granted.The U.S. has been engaged in Afghanistan for over 10 years, now. Junger's War provides a glimpse of what we have to show for it, what it has cost, and what it continues to cost as a generation of combat veterans returns home and tries to make its way in a country for which \"war\" is almost an abstract."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3285729-amy", "userReview": "Best known for The Perfect Storm, Sebastian Junger wrote about the Boston Strangler in A Death in Belmont and being a reporter in such hot spots as Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia in Fire. In WAR, Junger travels through Afghanistan with young U.S. troops as an embedded journalist. WAR provides a violent, unflinching account of the war in Afghanistan down to the bloody details of death and the minutiae of war. Afghanistan is such a poor, vast, isolated country with plenty of places for the Taliban and Al Queda to hide. In writing this book, Junger brings much needed attention to this ongoing war on terrorism. So little is written about Afghanistan in the press yet it\u2019s a fierce, exhaustive war. Junger also includes and honest assessment about the war in Afghanistan and the attitudes of the troops. WAR is set in three parts: FEAR, KILLING and LOVE. Junger adds extensive military history and facts throughout. When he explains fear he explains the body/mind connection and also the results of military tests [men have a greater reaction time than women:]. Remaining objective as possible, Junger certainly faces numerous challenges. He often must base decisions on journalistic integrity vs. personal safety. Soldiers use magical thinking and have varied superstitions. Most of the soldiers are in their early 20s, many with INFIDEL tattoos emblazoned on their bodies because \u201cThat\u2019s what the enemy calls us on their radios.\u201d War is the only thing many know at this point in their young lives. Re-entry into civilian life can often be much more complex than war for many. Having been used to the excitement and fast-paced action, suddenly many aren\u2019t doing much of anything and want to go back. In stark conditions, stocked for months with supplies and no relief in sight, the American troops often fight an unseen enemy that hides and follows no order, no rules of engagement. After 9/11 most people have a basic understanding of the modus operandi of terrorists. The Taliban fights dirty\u2014snipers, sneak attacks in early morning or late night and chaos. They have numerous \u201ccounter-measures\u201d to American attacks and are tricky to seek out and capture, mainly due to the terrain and the Taliban\u2019s intimate knowledge of the land. Not that any war is a positive. It\u2019s not. Junger states that the appeal of combat is not killing but protecting.

So I'd recommend watching Junger and Hetherington's film Restrepo about halfway through WAR or even before starting it.As a film, Restropo explores much of the same ground and time frame as War; it may be more limited than the book in some aspects, but it serves to bring to life the events of Junger's book and adds more of a human dimension to the guys of Battle Company. I watched Restrepo at about the halfway point of reading War, and it helped. I don't think Junger's writing by itself evokes enough personal connections to guys like Pemble, Hijar and Cortez, but Restrepo's close-up interviews and the videos of them in Afghanistan under fire brings these young men to life in a way the book doesn't; the combination of the film and the book adds a crucial dimension to understanding what Junger is writing about, especially the camaraderie that the third part of WAR focuses so closely on.Even something like the drunken phone footage from the train in Italy early in the film helps set up character and put faces to the names; without it the figure of Restrepo is just a name in Junger's book and the courage based on love that he writes about won't come across as strong and clear as it should."}, {"userName": "Larry Bassett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett", "userReview": "This is definitely a blood and guts story -- supposedly all true.

I actually saw some reviews, I believe at Amazon, by people who thought Junger's ego got too iinvolved with this project. I have no idea what they're talking about, since this seems to be a pretty egoless effort. About at the halfway point, Junger starts asking questions, and throwing a grab bag of anthropological and/or sociological facts at you as to why humans band to together to fight and kill other human beings. There's nothing all that systematic about this info, so it seems to be just that, a grab bag. The organization of the book also seemed odd, since the chronology jumps all over the place. But it isn't due to sloppy writing. I'm not sure what the design or template Junger had in mind, but the prose flows easily enough. If you're interested in this book I suggest you view the accompanying documentary that was made: Restrepo. I was able to watch it on Netflix streaming. The Afghan landscape has to be one of the most rugged places in the world to fight a war, and the documentary brings this fact stunningly to life.

You will be the better person for it.Junger's superficial portrait of soldiers buys into all the detrimental stereotypes that makes their lives in the civilian world harder. Through irresponsible reporting he depicts these young men as ignorant hooligans while he simultaneously glorifies the danger of combat (that Junger incidentally sat through). (At one point he skirts around the edges of calling himself \"brave.\")Looking for the sob story, Junger gravitates to Brendan O'Byrne, an alcoholic kid who was already shot by his father in civilian life. Guess who ends up having trouble when he leaves the Army? That Junger attempts to homogenize all combat soldiers around the one troubled kid who was willing to talk to him is baffling in its naivet\u00e9.I don't doubt that Junger thinks he cares for these men he embedded with, but these men, who don't seem to give a sh*t about Junger, are done a great disservice by this book.Negative two stars.More review here (the comments get funny):http://publishingperspectives.com/?p=..."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3538579-jay", "userReview": "The past year, I have read half a dozen books that have woven me through the Iraq war starting in 2003 (Nathaniel Fick's \"One Bullet Away\"; Evan Wright's \"Generation Kill\"), moving forward through 2004 and 2005 (Peter Mansoor's \"Baghdad at Sunrise\"; Donovan Campbell's \"Jocker One\") and ending with David Finkel's \"The Good Soldiers\" (the surge in 2007). Robert Baer's \"The Devil We Know\" provided a glimpse of Iran. Sebastian Junger's \"War\" has carried me into Afghanistan starting in 2007 and ending in 2008.The authors have either been engaged soldiers like Fick, Campbell and Mansoor or embedded journalists like Wright, Finkel and Junger. Karl Matterhorn in his Vietnam saga, \"Matterhorn,\" describes the soldiers: \"From the skipper right on down, they all wore the same filthy tattered camouflage....All of them were too thin, too young, and too exhausted. They all talked the same, too, saying fuck, or some adjective, noun, or adverb with fuck in it, every four words.\" From Nathaniel Fick though Junger, the same description would seem to survive into Iraq and Afghanistan. Culturally untutored youth serving under constant life-threatening danger from other untutored youth. \"The more things change the more they stay the same.\" Junger's book is not as consistently effective as Finkel's work, but it is well ahead of most of the other war narratives that I've read at this point. Except for Brendan O'Byrne, Junger's soldiers are not as three dimensional as I would have expected from the author. Junger interjects himself far too frequently in the actual chronicle of the Second Platoon's time in the Korengal Valley. But he does deal convincingly with the external and internal forces that keep the young men engaged in the heat of armed conflict. And he captures the tensions of that conflict well, too, adding reconfirming tones to Campbell and Finkel. In that respect, his soldiers echo those in the movie, \"The Hurt Locker\" with the lead soldiers re-enlisting, narcoticly, for another tour or the earlier \"Black Hawk Down\" that dramatized the cohesiveness--the love, as Junger's third chapter is entitled-- of the soldiers one for the other."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1608811-david", "userReview": "At times, War was so exciting, or funny, or poignant that I had to tell myself to stop enjoying it so much because it wasn't fiction. I guess in a lot of ways, that's the lesson to be learned here: that war is really, really wrong, but it sure is a rush.Sebastian Junger is a very skilled writer. War is a bit of a hodge-podge of a book. There's some on-the-scene narrative, there's some after-the-fact reporting, and there's even some social science. Normally that would be a big mess. Maybe it is a big mess. But it was all so compelling that I truly could not put it down once I had started it.The direct narrative of Junger's experiences while he was with the soldiers were definitely the highlights of the book. The danger is palpable as they go out on patrols. Back at camp, there is a constant tension in the air. Someone could die at any moment. But that's also where some of the most absurdly laugh-out-loud funny things happen. I even laughed when someone made a comment and then lost his arm. It was perfect comic timing. I tried not to laugh. I really did. I thought, 'that real-life person is never going to be able to use that arm again.' But it was too late.Nothing has changed on the macro scale. This book has nothing to do with politics or debates or the implications of going to war in other countries.
