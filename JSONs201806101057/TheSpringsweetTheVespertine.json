It completely stole my heart...and trampled it. I was incredibly heartbroken! In The Springsweet, Saundra Mitchell has redeemed my heart by mending our Zora\u2019s. The most stand-out quality I\u2019ve come to love about Saundra Mitchell\u2019s writing is the vividly realized atmospheres. In The Vespertine, I could see myself sitting around with the girls, getting ready for the ball and talking about the boys they would dance with in Baltimore. In The Springsweet, I could feel the hot winds of Oklahoma blowing on my face!! I could see the sparse, dry countryside for miles on end. I was there, next to Zora, seeing and feeling everything she was, so vividly. I absolutely love that. If any book can transport me like that, it\u2019s a winner in my book. We first meet Zora in The Vespertine. She is Amelia\u2019s cousin and gets her heart shredded in that book. I mean, absolutely destroyed! Blown to pieces. Her whole world crashes down. So you can imagine how this book in no way starts with the best of tones. It\u2019s rather depressing at first, and many times I wanted to curl up with it and cry because it made me so sad for her. It isn\u2019t until and unfortunate 3rd meeting with the very handsome and rich Mr. Theo de la Croix that things start to turn around. Then she gets sent to Oklahoma...where she meets the rugged, sexy Emerson Birch and things really start to get interesting! Ms. Zora Stewart now has to make a choice between the two, but I think there\u2019s never really a contest. Zora\u2019s ability was unique and I can see now how all the elements -- earth, water, fire, air -- come into play in this series. I just can\u2019t imagine how it will all come into play in the final book, Aetherborne, but I\u2019m extremely excited to find out."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2871271-angela", "userReview": "Charming historical-supernatural romance that's slow to start\nIn Saundra Mitchell's The Springsweet, seventeen-year-old Zora finds herself stuck in Baltimore - both emotionally and physically - as she grieves the tragic loss of her fianc\u00e9. When a rash choice provides a way out, she takes it and finds her way to the wind-swept prairies of Oklahoma to live with her aunt. Once there, Zora discovers that she has the power to sense water under the ground and that her skill is in much demand in a drought-ridden land. While burdened with the responsibility of locating water (and hope) for others, Zora finds that her own heart may be awakening again.Overall, The Springsweet was a charming historical romance with a light dash of the supernatural. The novel was short and succinct, and it was easy to sit down and devour it in one sitting. Zora, though a bit selfish, was a sympathetic character given her experiences and loss, and side characters like aunt Birdie and her young daughter helped flesh out the story. One of the love interests was also very likeable, and the romance, though quick and not entirely explainable, had some swoony moments. The greatest strength of the novel, however, lay in its detailed and beautiful descriptions of prairie and frontier life; these vivid mental images provided the story with an excellent sense of place and time.Despite these positives, the novel was slow to start, and the writing felt a bit awkward in a few places. This novel is also not a good choice as someone's first foray into a historical/period novel, as there were words or descriptions, such as Zora lifting up the \"combination\" under her dress, that didn't mean anything to me and left me confused. Some of the supernatural elements weren't clearly explained either. The romance also developed too quickly and without much substance. This was one of the few times that I wanted a book to be longer, instead of shorter. It seemed like a lot of my concerns about the romance and the supernatural elements could have been cleared up with a few more pages about each topic. Though it's advertised as a companion novel, not a sequel, there were also times I wished I had read Mitchell's first book, The Vespertine, before this. The story does a good job of filling in the gaps, but I still felt like I was missing something.Even though I found things I didn't like in The Springsweet, I found a lot that I did, and those strengths are enough to make me want to catch up on the first book The Vespertine and read the next (Aetherborne) when it comes out. In the coming book, I hope Mitchell continues to create a memorable sense of time and place while also providing readers with more insight into the supernatural ways and romances of her characters.Note: This review refers to an advance review copy."}, {"userName": "Mundie Moms & Mundie Kids", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4397975-mundie-moms-mundie-kids", "userReview": "An enthralling story about heartbreak, second chances, love, and learning to find yourself, The Springsweet is the perfect sequel to Saundra Mitchell's The Vespertine. Starting off where Amelia's story ended, Zora's story is one fans of this series will quickly fall in love with. Zora not only has to come to terms with her broken heart, but she learns as she heads out west, leaving the comforts of her home behind to carry on and find herself again. Zora's an enchanting character with a voice that's just as beautiful as Amelia's. She's courageous, endearing and strong in her own right as she learns to adapt to her new life in the Wild West, learns to let go, and delicately balances the fine line between being a respectful young women in her society vs being true to herself.Saundra has done such a suburb job creating compelling characters in this series. No matter how great or small their roles is, how lovable or horrible they are, they each have a purpose in this story's rich plot line. I thoroughly enjoyed the presence of a few characters from The Vespertine and quickly fell in love with a few new characters. Emerson Birch is one of those characters. Though Saundra created two wonderful, yet completely different love interests, Emerson grabbed my attention from the moment Zora meets him. Like Zora, he's lively, flawed, goes against the norm during this Victorian era period, and intriguing. There's something about Mr Birch that draws you in and leaves you wanting to know more about him. I loved the way Saundra carefully peeled back the layers of this rugged character. As much as I love the characters in The Springsweet, it's Saundra's passionate writing that completely swept me off my feet with this book. Saundra has a way with words that just pull me into her story. She made me feel as though I was there with Zora through out her entire book seeing what she was seeing, and experiencing what she was. Whether it was standing in a cool spring in the middle of the hot Oklahoma prairie during a scorching day, or slowing learning to over come the heartbreak from The Vespertine and learning to love again, everything Zora does is described so beautifully. Saundra's words are poetic, beautiful, and so elegant. Her attention to detail and her ability make me visualize the rich setting left me longing for so much more after I finished this book. I loved this book. It's one of those books that completely whisked me away during the duration I read. The writing is flawless, the romance is sigh worthy and the setting was enchanting to say the least. Plus I'm a sucker for this time period and absolutely love of this book. Much like The Vespertine, The Springsweet has a rich feel to it with a voice that reads like a classic and leaves you wanting much, much more. I highly recommend picking up this book for the writing alone. It's breathtaking and mesmerizing all at the same time! The Springsweet is a fabulous, clean cut read that both YA and adult readers will enjoy."}, {"userName": "Dark Faerie Tales", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766672-dark-faerie-tales", "userReview": "Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: City girl Zora Stewart moves out west to search for who she is and what she wants to do with her life after the tragedies she experienced in this companion novel to The Vespertine.Opening Sentence: That I went a little mad, I could not deny.The Review:The Springsweet is Saundra Mitchell\u2019s second novel featuring the character of Zora Stewart. Zora has been mourning for a year, and can\u2019t find the will to move on with her life in Baltimore. She starts looking for an escape by marriage answering ads for widowed farmers out west, but cannot go through with it once she is faced with the reality of what that life would entail. Instead, Zora decides to move to the sparsely populated Oklahoma Territory to help her recently widowed aunt with housework and raising her young cousin. I read The Springsweet before The Vespertine, so I did not fully appreciate this book and the character of Zora until I had finished both. This novel is a complete turn from The Vespertine because we now have a new narrator that we had only seen through Amelia\u2019s eyes before, and it is set as far from a city as possible. The strong and eloquent writing style is still very evident in this sequel.The Zora we see in this novel has experienced terrible tragedies from losing friends, family, and loved ones. I won\u2019t say who so I don\u2019t spoil The Vespertine, but Zora is a changed young woman. She is no longer carefree and playful, but somber and reserved. There is a spark of her former self that comes out when she encounters male characters like Theo de la Croix and Emerson Birch that gets her into trouble with her family and society. When Zora goes to a dance in the beginning of the book, Theo surprises her and she falls into a well. She surprises him by kissing him, ruining her reputation in Baltimore, and catalyzing her move to the Oklahoma Territory. This is a book about Zora finding who she really is after her former life is taken from her as she sets out to make her own way in the world.Once in West Glory, Zora realizes that her whole life has been easy compared to living in a soddy and hauling water from the well multiple times a day. Her main job is to look after her three-year-old cousin Louella so her Aunt Birdie can take in washing and mending for money. Since travel was expensive and time consuming, Zora has never met her aunt and cousin that she is sent to live with. She learns about them, and comes to understand how much life has hardened her aunt, but that she is still kind. The girl Louella is a stereotypical young girl who has the whole prairie to play in. One thing I found interesting was how well Zora mothers Louella even though she has no younger siblings or much experience with children that we know of. She treats Louella as if she was her own daughter. This raised my esteem of Zora since it showed that she has evolved to be able to take care of others.In the vast prairie, Zora finds that she has a talent for finding water underground. The magic within her works so she can see and sense where water is, and her aunt sets her up to find potential well spots on other people\u2019s land for money. Her talent turns sour when some people are unhappy with her discovery (or lack of) on their property. She finds a kindred spirit in Emerson Birch because he has the ability to make plants grow. Zora isn\u2019t new to the paranormal. In The Vespertine, her cousin Amelia could predict the future. Zora and Emerson\u2019s paranormal talents complement each other just like Amelia and Nathaniel\u2019s did in The Vespertine.Zora has two love interests in The Springsweet. The first is Theo de la Croix, the young man from Baltimore that Zora kissed after falling in the well. He followed her all the way to the Oklahoma Territory to unsuccessfully court her. Zora doesn\u2019t dislike Theo, but she is not interested in pursuing a relationship with him. She doesn\u2019t feel like she would be a good match for him, and wants him to do better. It works out well for both of them in the end. The other love interest is Emerson Birch, the scorned solitary Sooner. When her stagecoach is robbed and leaves Zora stranded on the side of the road, Emerson takes her in for the night and gets her to her aunt\u2019s house the next day. The town, and especially her Aunt Birdie, all look down on Emerson since he cheated when getting his land in the land run. This was humorous to me as an Oklahoman since Sooner is a revered mascot for my University\u2019s rival, the University of Oklahoma. It shows how much times have changed when the stigma attached to the term initially kept Zora from pursuing a relationship with Emerson, and now is a source of pride for many people. Besides being a Sooner, Zora cannot find fault with Emerson. He is just a quiet and thoughtful young man who wants to live his life, and Zora can understand this very well.The novel ends with Zora making up her mind about what she wants to do in life and she goes for it. In the last few pages, Zora receives a letter from someone she thought she would never see again, and now I honestly can\u2019t wait for the next installment in the series. I would recommend this novel for anyone interested in historical romances based in rural mid-America with a taste of the paranormal to tie it all together.Notable Scene:Whim clicked in me, like the pin in a door finally catching. Raising my skirts, I stepped onto the fountain\u2019s wide, low wall and closed my eyes. The water sang now, breathing soft against my face.A thousand icy pinpoints touched my cheeks, the well-deep chill streaming over me in waves. To the strains of a waltz, I walked the edge of the fountain. No peeking, my imp insisted. My chest felt full of bees, all buzzing wildly as I covered my eyes with my hand.One step, and then a second. The little danger thrilled me and my senses turned keen. Intimately, I knew the water, the sureness of the stone \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t fall in, I couldn\u2019t \u2013I did, when Theo de la Croix called out to me.Deceptively deep, the fountain swallowed me entirely. My beaded gown dragged me into the depths, and night, so appealing in the air, seemed a dark cap when filtered through icy water.And yet, I felt peace. The cold, so sudden, the loss of breath, so complete \u2014 I struggled just once against it, then sank in grace.Hard hands found me. They pulled me from he frigid water that seemed not so much cold as tight around me. It was leaving it that racked me with a chattering, shuddering convulsion.Laid on the lawn, rolled on my side, I felt very much a rag doll and coughed helplessly when the water drained from my nose and mouth.The Vespertine Series:1.

Loved it so much, I practically read it straight through and forgot to take any notes. D'oh. Review soon.***I hate staring at a blank piece of paper when I\u2019m trying to write a review. Conversely, I love that I was so engrossed in the novel that I neglected to take a single note. Luckily, I\u2019m caught up on reviews and not having to write this three weeks after I read it, so this should be relatively painless.I loved Saundra Mitchell\u2019s \nThe Vespertine\n when I read it last year. I hadn\u2019t read much in the way of historical fiction up to that point, but I was blown away with how easily the story pulled me in, and it turned me into a massive fan of the genre. The companion novel to The Vespertine was no different. You don\u2019t have to have read the first novel in this series, but it will help explain some things that the author touched on in The Springsweet.I didn\u2019t fully appreciate Zora\u2019s character in the first novel. She seemed pushy and flighty, and when things turned out badly for her, she withdrew into herself. That\u2019s the Zora you first meet in The Springsweet. It\u2019s been a year since her beloved Thomas was taken from her, and she\u2019s still depressed and at a loss for what to do with herself. Her mother doesn\u2019t know what to do with her sullen, yet impetuous daughter either. When things take a turn for the worse, Zora is shipped off to Oklahoma to help her young, recently-widowed aunt sustain her homestead.Zora doesn\u2019t believe she deserves happiness without Thomas. She doesn\u2019t believe she will, nor should she ever, find love again. And so she is content with the manual labor necessary to maintain her aunt\u2019s farmland, and for the most part, it keeps her from dwelling on the past much. But along the way, she unearths some things about herself. She is a springsweet, a water witch, a dowser. Zora can put this previously latent power to good use for other homesteaders and help support her aunt and cousin in the process. But as she learned from her cousin Amelia\u2019s situation in the first book, powers of this nature can be taken for granted\u2026and used against you.Zora also discovers that she is still alive. That her heart can belong to another, even after the tragedy she has survived. She only has to let herself want it. But there are two boys vying for her heart, and though her aunt pushes her toward the better match, Zora is pulled much more strongly to the boy deemed the wrong choice in the eyes of her aunt.The characters in The Springsweet are so well-written, so believable that I could envision them perfectly and could almost hear them speaking in a Southern drawl or in a genteel manner, depending on the speaker. Zora narrates the book, and she is from a respectable background, but she has a mouth on her, a tenacity that I found endearing. Her new locale only aids in the loss of her more refined manner. West Glory isn\u2019t quite what she expected, but through the beautiful prose, I could picture it quite clearly. And it made me yearn to go back and read the \nLittle House on the Prairie\n series.This isn\u2019t a throw-you-for-a-loop kind of book, and I did find some situations a little predictable, but it wasn\u2019t irritatingly so. As I was reading, it felt as if the book kept growing shorter. I wasn\u2019t ready for it to end! And now that it has, I want the next book, especially after that ending. I expected it, but even so, I\u2019m glad to have my suspicions confirmed and can\u2019t wait to see how it plays out. From gorgeous gowns and balls to open prairie and yummy cowboys, this series just keeps getting better!This review can also be found at The Starry-Eyed Revue."}, {"userName": "Vikki VanSickle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237983-vikki-vansickle", "userReview": "It is no secret that I love Saundra Mitchell.Her prose is beautiful but rather spare (much like the landscape she is writing about) but her skill is such that it doesn\u2019t take a lot of words to conjure a rich story. She is rather like Zora, a \u2018word\u2019 sweet summoning a story that is clear and simple with no frippery. The characters use period language and sentence construction which added to the authenticity of the book, but contemporary readers won\u2019t balk at this at times formal or unfamiliar manner of speech.I was in desperate need of something fresh and this book did not disappoint. I was more than happy to try something other than dystopian, paranormal, or speculative fiction.To be fair, there is obviously an element of magic in The Springsweet, but amazingly Mitchell so completely naturalizes the magic that it just feels like a highly specialized skill, like athleticism or musical ability. Plus the book isn\u2019t about magic, it\u2019s about the thrill and freedom of frontier life.Lovers of historical fiction like facts and details. There is plenty of that here. I also appreciated how Mitchell did not glorify the grueling pioneer lifestyle. There is nothing romantic about having to do hard labour on an empty stomach. Living in a soddy (literally a house made of sod) is dirty. Carrying a yoke and buckets of water to and from the well is exhausting and painful. All of this is well-represented, but so are the moments of satisfaction, relief and joy that Zora and Birdie have in their hard-won lifestyle.Even in grief, you get a sense of how feisty Zora is at the beginning of the book and she continues to come into her own as she discovers her skill as a springsweet, learns to fend for herself in the prairie and care for Louella, and comes to terms with her feelings for Emerson. Emerson is the \u2018bad boy\u2019 corner of a love triangle that also includes the aristocratic and more formal wannabe poet from Baltimore, Theo de la Croix, who follows Zora to West Glory in order to win her hand. I generally dislike love triangles but this one worked for me. Emerson and Theo are both worthy- though very different men- representing changing attitudes in America at the time. When Zora makes her choice, she is also making a statement about who she wants to be, and I liked this.Obviously lovers of historical fiction will eat this up and clamor for more, but The Springsweet will also appeal to readers who like a strong female heroine or have a taste for fine writing. At times I was reminded of Bones of Faerie, partially because the writing is so great, but also because the magic is naturalized in a similar manner. Teens who hate magic will probably still love this book. While not totally wholesome, it isn\u2019t racy, so younger readers can enjoy it, too. There is awesome witty repartee, plenty of sexual tension and a few good kisses to swoon over."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276205-kelly", "userReview": "The Springsweet is a young adult historical fantasy set in the late nineteenth century, mainly in the Oklahoma Territory. It\u2019s also a sequel to Saundra Mitchell\u2019s 2011 novel The Vespertine, though I didn\u2019t realize that when I ordered it. So the caveat to my review is that I read The Springsweet without that background. How does it hold up on its own? Quite well, actually.The heroine is Zora Stewart, a secondary character from The Vespertine, whose fianc\u00e9 died tragically a year ago. Zora\u2019s mother and friends think it\u2019s high time she returns to society and starts mingling with young men again. Zora wants no part of this; she\u2019d rather offer herself up as a mail-order bride and consign herself to a loveless marriage, or barring that, become a recluse in the attic. Finally, in desperation, she does something impulsive that causes her mother to send her away to live with widowed Aunt Birdie in Oklahoma.I didn\u2019t always understand Zora\u2019s actions in the early chapters of The Springsweet, but she says herself that her grief made her \u201ca little mad.\u201d Once she lets go of her death wish and realizes she is glad to be alive, she becomes a relatable and likable character. Life in Oklahoma takes some getting used to, but Zora tries so hard and works so hard that it\u2019s impossible not to admire her efforts. She also learns that she is gifted with a magical power: she\u2019s a \u201cspringsweet,\u201d a dowser or water witch. Birdie sees Zora\u2019s gift as a way for her to earn her keep and begins to hire her out to the neighbors.Mitchell paints a vivid picture of the Oklahoma setting, bringing to life both its beauties and its harshness. Zora\u2019s gift is a double-sided coin too. Using her power brings her joy, and sometimes she is able to bring joy to others through its use. But other times she has to deal with unscrupulous people or, even worse, break to someone the bad news that there is no water on their land. Birdie is yet another example of this duality. She reminds me of a (much younger) version of characters like L.M. Montgomery\u2019s Marilla Cuthbert \u2014 no-nonsense, hard, practical, but well-meaning and loving at heart.Along the way there\u2019s romance. The Springsweet contains the usual YA romantic triangle, but it didn\u2019t annoy me as much as it sometimes does. I liked the way it worked out. There\u2019s a subtle message here about female agency: just because a guy is a decent person and likes you doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to choose him; you don\u2019t owe him. He can be a nice guy but still not be the right one for you.Lovely writing adds to The Springsweet\u2019s appeal as well. Overall, I really enjoyed The Springsweet and plan to go back and read The Vespertine soon.Review originally written for FantasyLiterature.com"}, {"userName": "ILoveBooks", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4177633-ilovebooks", "userReview": "The second in The Vespertine series, The Springsweet focuses on Zora. Depressed after the events of the past year, Zora is desperate to get away from her home and all reminders of her departed friends and deceased love. When an opportunity to escape presents itself, Zora takes it. The eventful ride to her aunt\u2019s home in West Glory, Oklahoma, leads to Zora discovering her rare talent. After finding underground water for Emerson, a man she wishes she was not so attracted to, Zora realizes she is a springsweet. Being springsweet is having the ability to sense underground water.  Zora tells Birdie, her aunt, about her talent and soon Birdie begins hiring Zora out to help others find water. Thomas, a boy in love with Zora from her hometown, accompanies her on these trips and Zora\u2019s aunt is hopes Zora will marry him. The prairie is parched and farms are failing. Zora could be the answer to everyone\u2019s hopes, but what if someone\u2019s land does not have any water? The Springsweet is exciting and draws the reader into Zora\u2019s story. The main character, Zora, is kindhearted and impulsive. She often does not think about consequences and acts without thinking. Zora is kind though, and wants to help others with her talent. Aunt Birdie is young, but experienced much throughout her life. Trying to run a farm with only her very young daughter Louella for company is tough, but Birdie survives and is a good person. Sending Zora to find water for her neighbors earns her money and helps Zora\u2019s customers survive the drought. Emerson is strong, good-looking, humorous, and possesses a magic talent as well. He has the ability to make plants grow. Zora is attracted to him and wonders if her feelings for Emerson are a betrayal to her lost love. The man Aunt Birdie wants for Zora is Thomas. Chivalrous, wealthy, and good, Thomas would be a good husband for any woman. Zora cannot return Thomas\u2019s feelings though, and hopes she will not ruin his kind heart. Saundra Mitchell is a talented author whose books appeal to teen female readers. The author did a great job using the language of the time period and Mitchell\u2019s descriptions are excellent.

Many of you coming into this book will be familiar with Mitchell's style, but for those of you who aren't I do have to warn you that the magic in this story will not be as heavily played up as it usually is in some of the other YA books out there. It's more of a secondary plot element than a major one, although it does feature heavily in the story. First let me talk about what I liked about this book. I liked that Mitchell seems to have done her research about what life in the wilds of Oklahoma would be like during this time period, complete with sod houses and all. It's a touch of realism that serves the story well. I have to say that my favorite character in all of this had to have been Birdy. She's a tough, no-nonsense woman and at times I couldn't help but wish that the story had been centered around her more than Zora. Zora isn't an unlikable character, but she just seemed a little underdeveloped at times. Now for what I felt was a bit lacking. I can't help but feel that the story and characters should have been a little more fleshed out. Everything happens so quickly that I didn't think that many of the romantic developments felt like they unfolded as naturally as they should have and I think that if there'd been more fleshing out of the characters, the story's fast pace wouldn't have been as bad otherwise. I liked Zora for the most part, but I just couldn't entirely buy her chemistry with a certain male character. There was definitely enough there to make it interesting, but not enough to give the whiz-bang feeling that I crave from romance in my stories. I would be more ambivalent about this, but since this is the second book in the series I couldn't help but want more from a second entry. Overall though, this is still a nice book and fans of the first entry will be sure to enjoy it. If you haven't read the first book then you absolutely should, but it's not a necessity since most of Springsweet can be understood without it. 3.4 out of 5 stars(ARC provided by Amazon Vine)"}, {"userName": "Charlie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2808380-charlie", "userReview": "3.5 StarsIn an attempt to escape a wounded heart, Zora Stewart packs a bag and heads West. Robbery, rescue and the occasional tumbleweed follow. Being a fan of the Vespertine inspired me to pick up the companion novel, The Springsweet. The setting shifts from Balitmore to the hardships of prairie life along the great frontier. Because of the setting, the book has a western country feel and for those readers who enjoy American settler stories, The Springsweet will be a pleasurable and clean read. It's appropriate for most ages and has a hint of mysticism, but mostly is grounded in the historical fiction of the time period. This book definitely has a different appeal than the The Vespertine and I wasn't as intrigued or connected to Zora as I became to the heroine, Amelia. The attraction and sweet love story is well-scripted. However, given the title of the book, I felt the actual areas where springsweet was involved should have been dimensionally developed. This portion of the story was skimpy and lacked detailing and information that could have contributed to the books depth by creating more of a shadow similar to that found in The Vespertine. Readers have certain elements they love about a series, and this specific string would have strengthened my personal fascination in the book. I felt a bit cheated and was left to figure out, or rather guess about what happened to Mr. Larsen. It was too vague and because of this, lacked impact. Emerson was the most developed character and will likely be memorable. Zora, she's a sweet girl, but does not come with the same force as the beloved Amelia. Good. Beach read. Summer read, and if you want clean and innocent -- this is a safe bet."}, {"userName": "Tabitha Olson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3589873-tabitha-olson", "userReview": "Saundra Mitchell is a master of setting. All of her books have had a vivid and palpable feel to them, and this book is no exception. I could taste the dust of the road, smell the grass on the prairie, feel the water between my toes, etc. Whenever I want to feel like I\u2019m in another world, I pick up one of Saundra\u2019s books.Zora is a great character. Her grief is tangible and drives her to do selfish things because she can't see beyond it. That rang true to me. Desperation also drove her to find her inner strengths, which also rang true. And the guilt she felt from her attraction to Emerson was fantastic. I really liked Emerson, too. all his actions made sense according to his personality, and I had a good feel for who he is.The shape of the story wasn't as effective as I was hoping. It was pretty even throughout, and I kept looking for more surprises. The foreshadowing of complications from the wells was natural and needed, but I was hoping for something on top of that\u2014completely different, yet related. This story kind of seems a vessel to find the earth and water elements, and then the next book will have the actual conflict. Which is a bummer because I thought there were a few missed opportunities for conflict. For example, I wasn't sure of the point of the stage robbing, especially since we don\u2019t see Ellis again and the conflict with Royal doesn\u2019t really amount to anything. I am hoping it's not setup for the next book. The ending, however, is superb.

I think this is a much more thoughtful book and I actually prefer it to The Vespertine. Zora struggles with grief and guilt but she is also a determined and hardworking girl which I found admirable. Even though an Oklahoma soddy is a far cry from what she is used to, she pitches in and does her best to not be a burden to her aunt. The romance is sweet and although there are magical elements, the book reads more like historical fiction than paranormal romance or historical fantasy.It did seem that Zora adjusted to her new life rather quickly and she has no problem accepting her unusual abilities but that did not detract from my enjoyment of the book. The Springsweet is not described as a sequel to The Vespertine but it is best to read it in order or there will be major spoilers for The Vespertine. For fans who miss Amelia in this book, she will be back in the third book. The Springsweet combines adventure, prairie romance, and a hint of the supernatural to provide an entertaining read.

The beginning was a little like starting a story all ready in progress, but I picked up very quickly on what was going on. But I will say after reading this I will go back and read the first book, I liked the writing so much. This book has three big pluses for me love, magic and the old west. 3 things I love to read about and I got all of them in this book. My favorite was the main character who I loved immediately even tho we catch her at a really low point in the beginning I love how she mourned, it was just perfect for who she was. The writing tho put this book over the top for me. The dialog and the description of the way the characters felt and reacted was great.

It's my favorite thing about all three of her books. I felt like I was right in dusty, wild Oklahoma along with Zora (and wished I were there for the trysts at the stream with Emerson). I love how Zora grows; she starts out the book heartbroken, mourning her fiance, and grows into a strong, stubborn woman ready to move on, find her own destiny, and fall in love despite past heartbreak. There's a bit of a love triangle, but it's solved very happily; Zora always knows her own mind, and at the heart of it is an incredibly swoony romance. As much as I enjoyed the Baltimore setting of THE VESPERTINE, I think I enjoyed THE SPRINGSWEET even more; the hero was more my cup of tea, and the paranormal gifts of both hero and heroine were fascinating and felt more tightly entwined with both character and their setting.

Zora\u2019s character, though at first a little\u2026 out of touch with the consequences of her decisions, goes through a stunning transition from a young woman lost to herself to a strong character who is willing to step out of the roles she once defined as \u2018hers\u2019 and forge a new path for herself.

In particular, I liked on Zora Stewart, a character whose personality flew off the pages and made me laugh when she couldn't get off of the bed due to her dress! I was sad as I closed the book, believing that I wouldn't read anything new from that world again. And then earlier this year I discovered that The Springsweet was about to be released, with none other than Zora Stewart as the main character!The Springsweet picks up quite a few months after Thomas died and we meet a much changed Zora - she's chosen to stay in black and avoid everyone for a while, believing that Amelia and Nathaniel have died too. Her mother packs her off to the Wild Wild West to live with her aunt and while she's there she discovers that she has some interesting powers too.Zora slowly gets back to being herself again and you can really see the old Zora shining through her many layers of grief. She has some pretty funny moments in this too, mostly helped by not one, but two romantic interests, the slightly obsessive Theo and Emerson, who is decidedly rougher around the edges! Who will she pick? I think the 'problem' of two interested boys was fixed really well and I loved the outcome. Emerson did remind me a lot of Nathaniel, I have to admit!The story throws up the interesting idea of elements - specifically the idea of the different powers we come across in this and The Vespertine being linked to the elements - Fire, Air, Water and Earth is covered and after the ending, I'm dying to find out what would happen if these elements all met each other!

A year has passed since Zora Stewart lost her beloved Thomas in a tragic shooting; a year since her best friend Amelia returned to Maine. Though she\u2019s grieved her fiance for a socially acceptable amount of time, Zora\u2019s heart remains broken. She remains isolated, buried in her sorrow for a love and life that will never be. Her mother, worried about her daughter\u2019s depression, encourages Zora to start living again. Zora knows she must move forward, but she doesn\u2019t know how she can go back to a life of balls and frivolity \u2014 she\u2019s lost her innocence. She decides that a life of service to others, in memory of her dear Thomas, is what would be most appropriate for her.Her family and friends are not so convinced, and after being tricked into attending Baltimore\u2019s Sugarcane Ball, Zora is afforded the opportunity to find herself \u201cruined\u201d before her peers. Gladly done with Baltimore, she\u2019s packed up and sent off to the Oklahoma territories to live with her recently widowed Aunt Birdie. Once in Oklahoma, she discovers that she has a unique connection to water \u2013 she can sense it and see where the water runs beneath the earth. Her aunt, hardworking yet struggling, sees Zora\u2019s gift as an unexpected boon in hard times, and Birdie encourages Zora to hire out her singular, elemental talent. Zora \u2013 all too aware of the dangers and consequences of magical gifts \u2013 reluctantly agrees. With a new life in the territories, her new-found power and two intriguing young men vying for her attention, will Zora find herself in over her head once again? Or is this new path exactly what her shattered heart needs?Zora. I was excited to discover that The Springsweet features Zora as the main character. She is a very prominent figure in the first book of this series, The Vespertine \u2013 her character already beautifully developed in that story. I was absolutely heartbroken for her at the end of the first book, and I desperately didn\u2019t want that to be the end of Zora\u2019s story. In The Vespertine, Zora is portrayed as effervescent, quick-witted, beautiful, intelligent, impulsive, popular amongst her circle of friends, yet she\u2019s also kind and welcoming. Despite their many differences, Zora and her cousin Amelia become fast friends.In the aftermath of that glorious, disastrous, preternatural summer, The Springsweet finds Zora much changed \u2013 a shell of what she once was. She\u2019s withdrawn, lost, and doesn\u2019t know how she can ever recover from the loss of Thomas. However, underneath her grief, she still retains many of those qualities. They\u2019re just tempered with a healthy dose of reality and a better understanding of consequences. Moving to the plains of Oklahoma, she\u2019s no longer surrounded by the things that ceaselessly remind her of what she\u2019s lost, and her mind and hands are kept busy by the day-to-day labors of eking out a living on the land. Zora in The Springsweet is hardworking, is still kind and caring. She knows her mind, has a matured confidence and has little tolerance for injustice. She just needs to rediscover who she is in the wake of her tragedy. I especially love Zora\u2019s scenes as she works through the emotions she\u2019s been running from. They aren\u2019t heavy-handed, \u201cwham-bam-thank-you-ma\u2019am\u201d epiphanies, but rather gradual realizations on Zora\u2019s part about where her life has led her, who she is and what she wants.As previously stated, once in Oklahoma, Zora discovers her gift to sense water. To the farmers who claimed their plots in the Land Rush of 1889, water is vital. It\u2019s everything toward ensuring their livelihood and the future ownership of their stake of land. As a result, Zora\u2019s talents as a springsweet are much in demand, for those who cannot locate a viable source of water for their family and crops. I\u2019ll admit, I was extremely curious to see why, when things ended so badly when Zora pushed Amelia to use her powers as an interesting parlor trick, why Zora would willingly go along with her Aunt Birdie\u2019s plan to be hired out as a \u201cdowser.\u201d Zora knows all to well how quickly people can turn from enraptured to rabid when the magic isn\u2019t agreeable to them. She\u2019s witnessed herself how the magic isn\u2019t just a fun diversion \u2013 people\u2019s lives are inevitably altered because of using it. However, Mitchell\u2019s reasons for having Zora agree to Birdie\u2019s suggestion, despite the dangers, makes sense in the context of this story and their situation.In The Vespertine, I was impressed by Mitchell\u2019s lyrical writing, her descriptions, her dialogue. It all came together so well to create a beautiful historical piece. The Springsweet is no different. Her style is just so lovely, every phrase evocative, so vividly descriptive. I had no problem picturing the glittering ballrooms of Baltimore, cramped, smelly stagecoaches, or the vast windswept prairies. I love a well-researched historical, and one that can stay in period with the dialogue and prose, and this series does that beautifully. However, though Mitchell\u2019s writing is historically believable and achieves a wonderful emotional depth, it\u2019s not at all dense. It\u2019s actually a fairly fast read.Overall, The Springsweet is a beautifully penned, magical story about a girl on the cusp of adulthood \u2013 her story of self-realization and emotional healing \u2013 set against the fascinating historical backdrop of the Oklahoma territories.

Of course, as I said in my review at the time, I ended up really liking it, in large part because of the characters. When I found out we\u2019d get sequels/companion novels with more of these characters, I was pretty excited and so when I got an ARC of The Springsweet, I was even more stoked. As I\u2019ve said a million times on tis blog, I\u2019m a sucker for historical fiction, and anything to do with homesteading/ranching/wilderness is right at the top of my list, second only to Victoriana. And here? I pretty much get both! I\u2019m going to try to talk about The Springsweet without spoilers, but some from the Vespertine will inevitably sneak in here so be warned!I was nervous when I realized this book was about Zora. Zora kind of broke my heart in the last book, and I was afraid it was maybe too soon for me to be ready to see her again \u2013 that she wasn\u2019t ready to face life yet. But I was wrong. I think one of the things that made me like The Springsweet so much was Zora\u2019s strength. From the get go, she knows what she doesn\u2019t want. She knows what she will refuse to allow to happen to her, and she takes her fate into her own hands. She may not always make smart decisions or even well thought out ones, but she also refuses to be a passive participant in her own life. Watching her grow from the spoiled socialite she was in the first book to the woman she is at the end of The Springsweet was a satisfying progression. She learned from her mistakes and she carried her knowledge forward so that each and every thing that happened to her was an experience she drew from.Zora\u2019s growth is incredibly important in this book because it is, in a lot of ways, the whole plot. At its essence, The Springsweet is about a city-girl who needs a new life and finds it on the frontier. And she finds it with a gift she never knew she had. I actually love d the \u201cspringsweet\u201d aspect of this story because it was supernatural in a way that didn\u2019t feel hokey (not that Amelia\u2019s powers felt at all hokey in The Vespertine). It fit with both the setting and with Zora. More importantly, it was written in a way that made a strong visual impression, for both the reader and Zora.I also really liked Emerson. I especially liked that we got to see all of his best qualities in a roundabout way. Zora finds out so much about him from local gossip, which gave the small town setting a lot of charm. It was also interesting because most of the people talking to Zora are trying to convince her he\u2019s no good, so we get to see not only Emerson\u2019s awesome but also the problems that come with the time period. Emerson, though, was great because he was such a compliment to Zora (and you\u2019ll see what I mean when you read the book). He was steady and patient, but also funny and charming. You could see why Zora was drawn to him and appreciate that he let it come to her so slowly.If I had a real complaint about this book it would have to be that The Springsweet is too short. The Springsweet is only forty pages shorter than The Vespertine, but I kind of missed those forty pages. The book was well paced, but I don\u2019t think more detail would have changed that. There were details I\u2019d have liked to see more of, especially as it concerned background characters like Theo and Aunt Birdie. I think there were a few plots with these characters that, though fun, could have been something more (both less predictable and less surprising, if such a thing is possible) with a little more backstory. Even the town itself that I think could have benefitted from a little more page space, because scenes like the barn raising were charming and cute, but I wanted more from them. I think, in the end, The Springsweet was a story about Zora and Emerson and I had everything I needed for that story, but I also felt like Saundra Mitchell wanted to tell me more and it just didn\u2019t make it to the page.The Springsweet comes out on April 17, and I\u2019m reviewing it now so that if you haven\u2019t read The Vespertine yet you can get on it and catch up before release day. The Springsweet is one of those period pieces that leaves you happy when you\u2019re done reading it, and I can\u2019t wait for more from Zora and Amelia and their friends.Reviewed at WhatchYAreading on April 2nd, 2012."}, {"userName": "Joy (joyous reads)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4352734-joy-joyous-reads", "userReview": "Hope springs eternal.Mourning the death of her beloved, Zora Stewart decided she needed to escape. What better way to forget about the tragedies in her life but to occupy herself with back-breaking labour? Ruined in Baltimore by her own devices, her mother shipped her off to a stead in Oklahoma where farming life flounders due to the scarcity of water. Little did she know, within her lies the ability to call on its sources. But as soon as she availed herself of the remuneration for being \"springsweet\", guilt and worry soon burdens her as she recognizes hope in the people's eyes and the responsibility of being the person who can possibly give it. But among all things, she hopes that her stay in Oklahoma will ease some of the grief for the loss of Thomas. In the brusqueness of the West, she meets Emerson, a recluse who alleviates some of the pain simply with his presence. Slowly but surely, she starts to find a reason to keep going and finds the pathway toward a life she's meant to live.Much like its predecessor The Vespertine, The Springsweet is a historical romance with a touch of paranormal. I wouldn't call it subtle, but certainly the characters' abilities are pretty tame in relation to the other books that I've read in this genre (paranormal). Basically, Amelia's, Nathaniel's, Zora's and Emerson's powers are natural by origin. As in, Amelia's is fire, Nathaniel's is air, Zora's is water and Emerson's is earth/soil.Nope. Amelia does not breathe fire. She sees the future only in the backdrop of a burning sunset.No, Nathaniel does not create super storms. He simply 'jumps' and he can be wherever he wanted to be. He's like air. He can be anywhere.Zora cannot summon a tsunami of water but she knows where she can find them.And no. Emerson cannot direct earth to open up and swallow his proverbial nemesis. He can grow anything on his command.Theirs was almost primitive and basic and totally appropriate in the era in which the author chose to tell their stories.The Vespertine has the Austenesque feel to it while The Springsweet will take you back to the old Frontier. Saundra Mitchell excelled, quite spectacularly in whisking me away to these worlds while staying in the same period. How did she do it? Well, I imagine an incredible amount of strenuous research and profound imagination were involved. Call me insane, but she romanticized the wild, wild West for me.Zora was a completely different character here compared to who she was in The Vespertine. She suffered losses in which a girl her age would consider impossible to overcome. But she grew up a lot. She lost a lot of her spright but she gained a lot more resolve and strength in spite of all the hardships, both physical and emotional she'd had to endure.There were two love interests in this book but I wouldn't be so quick to say it's a love triangle. For the first time ever, I'm actually torn that the other guy didn't have a prayer. He was sweet, gentlemanly and had the guts to chase her across the country. And his counterpart - the other guy was a force in which Zora's abilities made more sense and therefore, a part of her that I don't know she can live without...and he's incredibly hot. *sigh* So what's a girl to do? I say it's not a love triangle because Zora didn't really feel anything for the other guy so there wasn't a moment when she vacillated between the two.The Springsweet is a take off from the other books from my shelves and I loved what Saundra has given us so far. I'm dying to read the next book!VERDICT: Sweeping plains, barn-raising, yokels, horse-drawn wagons. The setting was, again highly imaginative yet somehow scarily accurate. If I was turned off by historical romance then, Saundra Mitchell single-handedly changed that for me."}, {"userName": "Rhiannon Ryder", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3290187-rhiannon-ryder", "userReview": "Although Amelia's fire was enjoyable, I have to say, I was elated to find out The Springsweet was entirely about Zora. I adored Zora, and her ending was not one I wanted to leave her with, so it was entirely satisfying to find her in the very first pages, with no preambles.Mrs. Stewart, sadly, wasn't in this one as much. However, she's in the beginning and continues on just as I expect, in the most satisfying combination of proper mom for the time period, and one who understands the confines of their society and is willing to work around them. In a word, she's delightful, and I'm relieved we get a bit more of her before Zora leaves for Oklahoma.Growing up in the prairies, I read a great many stories about homesteaders both in Canada and the States. Wonderful books like The Doll, by Cora Taylor, filled my imagination with the struggles, the heat and the hardships of those plucky people. I'm not sure if it's my Saskatchewan roots, or something else that appeals to me about the whole thing, but I find I'm still drawn to these stories. The Springsweet is an excellent YA entry into the category. Mitchell describes the hardships, the community and the struggles but she balances them nicely by paying tribute to good moments too. I loved the Barn raising scene, it so beautifully showed how people came together, and it's a sense of group spirit that exists still today in the prairies. I've always thought of that feeling of community, as a defining characteristic of being a prairie person. I was charmed she caught, and expressed the feeling in so many ways.Unlike The Vespertine, The Springsweet has a small love triangle. This one is about the proper gentleman versus the improper, and I liked how Mitchell rolled it out, how very un-prepared for Zora Theo is and how very capable of handling her Emerson is. Their play against each other shows so many of the strange rules of the time to good advantage, and it highlights so many of the limitations in place for people to do the \"proper\" thing. Of course Zora's modern notions expressed this well too.Theo relaxed a bit, washed over with vindication. \" I believe in chivalry.\" \"oh, I don't,\" I replied. \"A knight always gets to have his cake and eat it too, doesn't he? 'Hello, my lady, I love you- but I must run off to find the Holy Grail now. Wait for me!\" Cross, Theo considered me from the corner of his eye. \"That's not chivalry at all. And finding the Grail would be an honorable quest.\" \"Says the man who would get to ride after it and savor all sorts of adventure in the search,\" I shrugged; I had hardly designed the way of the world. I was simply subject to it. \"I assure you, there are absolutely no epic ways to make a sampler or roast a lamb shank.\" \"So you're a suffragette,\" Theo declared. I stopped and turned to him. \"What if I were?\" And amazingly, Theo quailed. He honestly lost a shade of color from his handsome face, and his brows tented ever so slightly in horror, as if I had pulled open my coat to reveal a clockwork heart, or perhaps a second head growing just beneath my breast. It lasted just a minute, but the impression lingered, even as he recovered. \"I don't see why women shouldn't have the vote.\" \"That's very generous of you,\" I said...\"But I don't believe we were talking about the vote.\"Like The Vespertine, The Springsweet is both a lovely character piece and a fascinating look at a time period and place in history. It was witty and engrossing, and although it doesn't have the mystery of The Vespertine I was completely swept away by the adventure of it. I will be awaiting the final part of this series, The Elementals, with baited breath."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4862284-justin", "userReview": "Let me just start by saying that I enjoyed The Springsweet a lot more than I did The Vespertine. It was much easier to follow, and I actually enjoyed the setting more. It doesn't take place very long at all after The Vespertine ended, but it's completely different. Saundra really has a talent for making her writing fit the period, and areas she is trying to write about. As you can probably gather, The Springsweet is the companion novel to The Vespertine in which you follow along with Zora on her journey west.The setting in The Springsweet takes place in Oklahoma. Which I really feel like Saundra did a great job of portraying this setting. I don't know a large amount of how things were then, just what I have learned. But I can easily say I was convinced by her descriptions. It really seemed like it was a huge change for Zora to, considering she was from Baltimore. So it was interesting seeing how she adjusted to it all as the story went on.As with The Vespertine, I really enjoyed the characters in The Springsweet. I really like Zora, I was really happy that she was going to be the main focus in this book. Birdie (Zora's Aunt) and Louella were also really enjoyable characters. Louella is really young, so she really isn't a major character or anything but I feel like she added some really cute context to the story. And of course you have that romance between characters. This time it's between Zora and Emerson. I felt as though it was a pretty subtle romance though, it was nice seeing it blossom throughout the book. And then to if it actually went anywhere. But all in all, there is a great cast of characters. They are all believable, and really seem to go together nicely. Good and bad alike.The story in The Springsweet was much more enjoyable for me. It was much easier to understand the ability Zora had, and it just seemed a lot lighter on the paranormal side which was nice in my opinion. It allowed you to digest a lot of the other aspects of the story, without being so overwhelmed with the Paranormal side of it. I feel like that was what made this book much more enjoyable in the end. The last page really through me for a loop though, it has me really curious to see if this series will continue or not. I am assuming it will based on what happened in the Epilogue. I guess we will just have to wait and see though. It was an extremely enjoyable story though, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. It was great getting to know Zora more and being able to follow her journey.Just as I had mentioned with The Vespertine, this series is really different. It's enjoyable, but it takes a little while to get use to. One you get use to the writing, and wrap your head around some of the concepts it really turns out to be quite enjoyable. I would still highly recommend this series, it might not appeal to everyone. But if you truly do enjoy a great Historical Fiction series, this is one you got to check out. I have openly admitted I find the paranormal aspects a little weird, but it doesn't really take to much away from the story as a whole. You still have the beautiful and well written settings, and the awesome characters. So if you haven't read The Vespertine, I would make sure to do that before The Springsweet comes out. It's really worth something if you're looking for something different, that still has amazing and rich details.Originally posted on my blog, just follow the link: http://www.justinsbookblog.com/2012/0..."}, {"userName": "QNPoohBear", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22177907-qnpoohbear", "userReview": "This book is a companion to The Vespertine which I have not read.

Zora's mother worries about the girl's moping but Zora feels she can never be a part of society again and makes plans to become a mail order bride out West. After creating a scandal in Society with Mr. de la Croix, Zora is sent off to her Aunt Birdie in Oklahoma Territory (newly opened to settlers). Shortly after arriving in Oklahoma, Zora's coach is accosted by highwaymen and she's left all alone along the dusty road where she's picked up by Emerson Birch, a local homesteader. Emerson is handsome, yet a bit prickly and Zora isn't sure she trusts him. Birdie warns Zora away from Emerson, but Zora isn't sure what to think; Emerson has been kind and discovered a secret about Zora that even she didn't know. Zora is what the locals call a springsweet, meaning she has the magical ability to find water. Zora has feelings for Emerson she isn't sure she understands. She feels connected to him in some way and is intrigued by their connection. Then Theo comes calling in his fancy carriage and Birdie pushes Zora into accepting his courtship. When Birdie discovers Zora's talent she decides to turn it to their advantage. Zora allows it, even knowing what will come. Does she have the courage to live again? To follow her feelings? This story reminded me a lot of The Luxe novels by Anna Godbersen because of the time period, the high society and the rebellious teen romance. I could have done without the teen romance but parts of it were sweet and done well, mostly until the epilogue which was so far from realistic. I liked the connection between Emerson and Zora and how they slowly come to know one another through this amazing connection they share. The historical details in the novel are excellent. I loved the description of Oklahoma Territory and the history of the land rush. I'm taking History of the West this semester so I appreciated the author's attempt to create a realistic West rather than the mythic West of Buffalo Bill and dime novels. The description of homesteading in Oklahoma in 1890 is the best part of the book. The characters aren't really very likeable though. Not knowing the events of the Vespertine, I couldn't really feel Zora's loss very keenly. I felt sorry for her but I didn't like the way she handled her grief. I didn't really come to know her as a person through the course of the novel. I didn't like Theo very much either. He's a bit of a stalker though he's kind. I liked Emerson a lot and thought the story should have alternated from his point-of-view. I wanted to know more about him. Don't read this thinking it's a true paranormal or gothic like The Vespertine because it's not. The paranormal is more subtle which I really liked. The plot leaves the reader hanging a bit and I expect there will be a sequel. The writing style is very nice. I liked the descriptive passages the best and could easily imagine Oklahoma. I would have liked a bit less drama in the beginning and more about Zora and her special talents. I liked the story well enough to recommend it to fans of historical fiction, especially teen girls."}, {"userName": "Heidi (yabibliophile)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1481868-heidi-yabibliophile", "userReview": "I have a new rule.

I'm a romantic at heart, and drawn to all kinds of anachronisms, and to me, The Vespertine was a book that, wonderfully, and amazingly, just didn't fit in, didn't quite belong amidst all the other young adult books I was reading, and that's a huge part of why I loved Saundra's book and her ethereal writing style quite so much. I've recommended The Vespertine to so many people and talked extensively about it here, so when I received a copy of The Springsweet for an ARC tour, I was thrilled and elated, and I also had high hopes for the sequel to The Vespertine, it being Zora Stewart's story. The Springsweet picks up right at a year after the events of The Vespertine, and it's not a lie to say that when I read the opening passages, I felt like I'd come home, back to Saundra's beautiful writing. That I went a little mad, I cannot deny. - Zora Stewart, page 1. With a beginning like that, I KNEW I was going to love The Springsweet, and I did definitely adore this novel. As Zora flees Baltimore, and the reminder of the tragedies her family has suffered, she starts anew in the untamed West, and under Saundra Mitchell's pen, Oklahoma comes alive, a hot, dry, hard place that Zora nevertheless finds something elusive in: hope, and a rebirth of sorts when she discovers her ability to locate water underground, becoming a \"springsweet.\" This touch of the paranormal was very well-done, and flowed nicely with the rest of the story. I immediately felt for Zora, who is Understandably broken and grieving, and fell for her all over again, for the spirit buried underneath her mourning. Zora was changed vastly from the first book, but she still impressed me throughout The Springsweet with her heart and her ferocity.I also fell for secondary character Emerson Birch, and one of Zora's two would-be suitors. The second suitor, Theo de la Croix was a true gentleman, and although I found him to be very kind and sweet, it was Emerson I was drawn to: brave, unfettered Emerson. I could see why Zora gravitated toward him, as well. Saundra Mitchell certainly brought to life a man befitting the wild, feral Oklahoma, giving us just enough glimpses of Emerson, his abilities, and his heart to make him utterly irresistible. I looked forward to Zora's interactions with him, and only wish we'd seen more of them together!The Springsweet left me a little breathless with the beautiful scope of the story playing out, and Saundra's ability to so easily draw me in to the story she's telling. Page after page, I was astounded at the grace spilling from the pages, and my ONLY complaint is that the story wasn't long enough! I wanted and needed more - more time with Zora, and with Emerson, and even with Birdie, who was a wonderfully developed character. I couldn't help it - I LOVED what I was reading and I quite desperately didn't want The Springsweet to end. However it DID end...and on an amazingly heart-pounding cliff-hanger that left me grasping at the pages, and already looking forward to the third and final book in this series, Aetherborne. I'm going to hate the wait, but I have EVERY bit of faith that it will be worth it!"}, {"userName": "Ashlie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4478856-ashlie", "userReview": "The Vespertine was a very unsuspecting book, I read it with no expectation and I was as mesmerized by the story as Amelia was by her visions. The ending was so sad, but never rushed or desperate. So I was thrilled to know that it was part of a serious; It could have been fine, great even as a standalone book, it just would have been sad (and maybe a bit depressing, but I would have recommended it!). Knowing that it would be part of a series, I was excited, but a bit nervous, because Amelia didn\u2019t have the happiest of fates, so how could it be a series? I thought each succeeding book would focus on a character introduced by the previous book, and I trusted Saundra Mitchell\u2019s writing, so I knew I would read it. When I realized The Springsweet would focus on Zora and her life following that fateful summer of burning Vespers, I felt confident that it would be wonderful, and as I read it, that was confirmed. But as I neared the end of the book, I loved it more than I realized I would. I mean, seriously, I adore this story-to the point where I want to sleep with my Kindle to make sure it's there when I wake up. Zora\u2019s determination is a force to reckon with, and her callers seem almost as stubborn. But her heart is in the right place, and she\u2019s not without couth. She knows how to turn the attention in the direction she thinks would best benefit everyone involved. She helps everyone get what they deserve, all while gently shaking off and creating new connections that leave the feelings and egos of all parties involved intact, and better off. She is a great MC and she is so much fun to read about. The Springsweet is so natural. I have to compare it to waiting for your first child (even though it\u2019s the 2nd in the series). During your pregnancy, you wait for your child\u2019s life to really begin, anxiously (waiting for the book). You prepare a home for it (you dust your bookshelves or clean out your Kindle), you nurture it the way you should by eating the right foods and exercising (researching and writing draft after draft). Then you stress yourself out making those last minute preparations, nervously, because, *GASP,* the baby will be here anytime now (revisions, revisions, revisions!!!) Then your baby is born and your child is more perfect than you could imagine them being, and you love, love, love, LOVE them, more than life itself, and you know that really, you didn\u2019t have to do anything, the miracle is bigger than you and it just is. That\u2019s how the Springsweet was for me. Although I know it\u2019s the product of hard work and lots of time on Saundra Mitchell part (and also the part of the many publishing hands a book sees), it seemed like it came out whole and perfect, like it was born a miracle. It was so delightful, yet moving and it had so much substance! It was full of life, not sad like The Vespertine was (although that book was MARVELOUS!) It is a fitting companion and it really sets up amazingness for book 3. I\u2019m rating The Springsweet 5 STARS and cannot WAIT for Aetherborne!The Springsweet was beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! It was indulgent and tantalizing; it turned over all the right stones and lead us down a sweet, gritty path. I feel refreshed, curious and invigorated by the story and its beautiful telling. Saundra Mitchell is an artist! This book, and the series so far, are well done in every aspect."}, {"userName": "Carina Olsen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5457171-carina-olsen", "userReview": "I almost think I liked this book better than The Vespertine. But only almost. The Springsweet is a must read book if you have read The Vespertine. Although it would be great even if you haven't. This book is even shorter than the first one; and although I wished to much it had been longer I loved it the way it is. It has perfect writing, perfect characters, perfect plot and an perfect ending. Although a bit evil.This book starts about a year after The Vespertine ended. This is Zora's story. So it has been a year since Thomas died; her almost-fianc\u00e9. And Zora is grieving. She is grieving a lot. Because not only did Thomas die, but also another of her close friends. And she believes that Nathaniel and Amelia is dead as well. So Zora is really hurting. She wants to die at times, too. But instead of doing so, she does something crazy to be sent away from Baltimore. She kisses a stranger at a ball. I didn't like him much. But that is only because Zora didn't. Because he would have been an awesome love interest if he had been fit for Zora. But he isn't. Zora then is sent to live with her Aunt, Birdie. And her adorable child. I loved that a lot. Although things didn't seem that good out there in the wild western. It wasn't anything like what Zora had thought it would be. I, for one, didn't enjoy it much. So much hard work o.O I never would have survived. lol :) But I did like all the characters. Although Birdie was very pushy with certain things; I did like her. I don't want to give away too much plot, but that guy, Theo, ended up following Zora; hoping to court her. And, well, I didn't like it at all. There isn't any romance between them; although Theo does seem to be interested in Zora. She is just being polite and such, but she does hurt him in the end. But I enjoyed that a bit. Hih. He just wasn't a match for Zora. When Zora arrived in the new town, she was robbed. And ended up having to walk her way to the town. But on her way she met Emerson. And ended up staying in his bed. But nothing happened; though ;p But it was the start of everything. That night Zora discovered she had a power of her own. And I enjoyed that very much. Liked her powers :) Then we got to know Emerson. And omg. He is an amazing love interest. And I loved every scene that he was in. He is adorable. And kind. And sweet. And just way too amazing. I loved reading about Zora falling for him. Emerson also has some powers; and I loved them as well. He is sort of broken; in a way. He is all alone. And I felt sorry for him and loved him all the more. The Springsweet is very different from The Vespertine. The setting is even more different; although still in the same time zone. And I liked that a lot. There is always things happening in this book; and I loved that Zora thought about Thomas so much. She loved him a lot. The plot in this book is so great, and the characters amazing. The ending though, the ending is mean. It made me want so much more! But the ending is also happy. But there better be a sequel. There must be! I cannot if there isn't. And the sequel better have the same characters (A) Hih :) Just really hoping there will be another book. <3 Also? Remember all the people I disliked at the ending of book one? I still hated them all.If you have read The Vespertine, then you must read this book. If not, then you must read them both :)"}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4036455-kate", "userReview": "I really liked The Vespertine, so I was nervous when I realized this book was about Zora. Zora kind of broke my heart in the last book, and I was afraid it was maybe too soon for me to be ready to see her again \u2013 that she wasn\u2019t ready to face life yet. But I was wrong. I think one of the things that made me like The Springsweet so much was Zora\u2019s strength. From the get go, she knows what she doesn\u2019t want. She knows what she will refuse to allow to happen to her, and she takes her fate into her own hands. She may not always make smart decisions or even well thought out ones, but she also refuses to be a passive participant in her own life. Watching her grow from the spoiled socialite she was in the first book to the woman she is at the end of The Springsweet was a satisfying progression. She learned from her mistakes and she carried her knowledge forward so that each and every thing that happened to her was an experience she drew from.Zora\u2019s growth is incredibly important in this book because it is, in a lot of ways, the whole plot. At its essence, The Springsweet is about a city-girl who needs a new life and finds it on the frontier. And she finds it with a gift she never knew she had. I actually love d the \u201cspringsweet\u201d aspect of this story because it was supernatural in a way that didn\u2019t feel hokey (not that Amelia\u2019s powers felt at all hokey in The Vespertine). It fit with both the setting and with Zora. More importantly, it was written in a way that made a strong visual impression, for both the reader and Zora.I also really liked Emerson. I especially liked that we got to see all of his best qualities in a roundabout way. Zora finds out so much about him from local gossip, which gave the small town setting a lot of charm. It was also interesting because most of the people talking to Zora are trying to convince her he\u2019s no good, so we get to see not only Emerson\u2019s awesome but also the problems that come with the time period. Emerson, though, was great because he was such a compliment to Zora (and you\u2019ll see what I mean when you read the book). He was steady and patient, but also funny and charming. You could see why Zora was drawn to him and appreciate that he let it come to her so slowly.If I had a real complaint about this book it would have to be that The Springsweet is too short. The Springsweet is only forty pages shorter than The Vespertine, but I kind of missed those forty pages. The book was well paced, but I don\u2019t think more detail would have changed that. There were details I\u2019d have liked to see more of, especially as it concerned background characters like Theo and Aunt Birdie. I think there were a few plots with these characters that, though fun, could have been something more (both less predictable and less surprising, if such a thing is possible) with a little more backstory. Even the town itself that I think could have benefitted from a little more page space, because scenes like the barn raising were charming and cute, but I wanted more from them. I think, in the end, The Springsweet was a story about Zora and Emerson and I had everything I needed for that story, but I also felt like Saundra Mitchell wanted to tell me more and it just didn\u2019t make it to the page."}], "description": "Heartbroken over the tragic death of her fianc\u00e9, seventeen-year-old Zora Stewart leavesBaltimore for the frontier town of West Glory, Oklahoma, to help her young widowedaunt keep her homestead going.
