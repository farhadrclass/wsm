I plan to re-read it many times and recommend it to just about every woman I know.

I did read it slowly to allow the chapters to digest before moving on. It's a deep, spiritual, biblical read. I loved it! It wasn't superficial, nor did I feel guilty or at fault for my failures as a woman (You know ladies - not doing it \"all\" so to speak)Many things I read and learned in this book has stuck with me. There is a small 'study guide' in the back of the book. I did not do that.

With that being said, this book was still a good reminder for addressing what I need to work on and how to keep growing in my faith. I do need to be better about know scripture so that these truths are in my heart in my deepest times of need. I liked the point to guard my heart against things that are not good for me - funny thing is I have been telling my tween daughter the same thing as she finds friends who are not \"true\" to her. I like the comment - \"Guard your heart! Whatever you allow into your life will eventually be revealed - both the good and the bad! So true! Also loved reading that a \"quiet and gentle spirit is a heart free from fear.\" As I have grown in my faith that is so much of want I desire for me and for my family! Reading this also reaffirmed forgiveness for others - not so much for them but for my heart and my freedom to enjoy life. I love how by forgiving others will help my soul to avoid \"shriveling.\" I can grow \"bigger\" by forgiving others and this will open up so much for me. I also liked the comment \"Forgiveness is a love offering we pour out before the Lord - an act of gratitude\" and \"Love keeps no records of wrongs.\" The comment to \"keep still\" in times of trouble was also comforting and a thought I need to remember because I tend to get all aflutter rather than staying calm - be still and trust in the Lord! The final thought I liked in the book was \"the simple fact that I have an opinion doesn't mean I have to share it!\" Sigh - I need to remember that the next time I get truly angry! Good ideas to try to make myself a kind and helpful person."}, {"userName": "Becca", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22375755-becca", "userReview": "My sister and I worked through this book together and learned a lot about ourselves and our place in the world as Christian women. What I love so much about this book is how down to earth the author is and how honest she is with her readers. She doesn't preach to us from the standpoint of a \"perfect Christian woman,\" she is still finding her way just like we are- I love that! Each chapter is accompanied by questions and bible verses that help readers dig deeper as they work through topics from dealing with their flesh women to becoming women who wear Jesus.

One of my prayers that I like to keep going - since it's the prayer God always answers, no matter what (!) - is for God to remove anything about me that He doesn't like. Believe me when I say that if you don't mean that, then absolutely do not pray for it; it's like the one prayer that 100% of the time God has always answered.Anyway, there was one thing about this book that I strongly disliked, and I'm sure some readers would disagree. There are several instances where the author has long paragraphs describing what she said the Lord had spoken to her personally. First off, I have a strong aversion to anything having to do with Jesus Calling by Sarah Young. When people take the Lord's words and use them as their own as though God is speaking directly to you, I don't know, I just feel like that is not right, especially in the way it is used in Jesus Calling. The way that the author said the Lord spoke to her in Having a Mary Spirit had me feeling kind of the same. At one point, she gave the Lord a twang. Do I believe God speaks to people? Oh, absolutely! But this most often occurs through His word. So, her having full paragraphs of the Lord speaking to her had me thinking it was more of an impression that God gave her and not God directly speaking those words to her. I thought it would have been better if she had written that was what God taught her, etc. instead of what He directly spoke to her. Me nitpicking, but it did bother me quite a bit every time it came up.The reference to the \"flesh woman\" and the mention of Twanda, got a little old for me as well.This book is really for anyone who wants to change. You know there are certain things holding you back in your life, and that God would like to remove. Having a Mary Spirit really lays out, in a beautiful way, how that can take place and what we can do to allow God to transform us through the Holy Spirit. It may sound grueling, but this was just an excellent read. I was dealing with some bitterness and things going in to this read (that have been so hard to get rid of), and this book helped me have a better perspective. There were some really excellent quotes from various books the author read that meant something in her life, and I'm seriously going to copy her list and see if I can read some of them. For those interested, some versions of this book (not sure if it is every version) also include a Bible study at the back. Overall: definitely worth a reread; I got a lot out of this book"}, {"userName": "Christabelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9618671-christabelle", "userReview": "I hate to admit, I needed this book.

This book might be good for a women's Bible study. I read about 85% of the book. I kept looking for some real practical how-to's. The ideas seemed, well, simplistic. I guess I was looking for something deeper. And I did not connect with her humor. But, as I mentioned, others loved the book and said one woman said it was her favorite of all time and that she'd read it again. So I might be missing something. Good comment: we want to be conformed to Christ's image but not challenged in her chapter on training and discipline. I did really appreciate this quote from Andrew Murray and sent it to friends.  Humility is perfect quietness of heart. It is to expect nothing, to wonder about nothing that is done to me, to feel nothing done against me. It is to be at rest when nobody praises me and when I am blamed or despised. It is to have a blessed home in the Lord where I can go in where I can go in and shut the door and knee to my Father in secret and to be at peace in a deep sea of calmness when all around and above there is trouble."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7398985-rachel", "userReview": "After having read Joanna's first book \"Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World\" {AMAZING!!} years ago, I couldn't wait to read her next book in her series.

And after reading it, coupled with the Lord's timing, I am changed from the inside out in this area of God's choosing to deal with in me. I lead a group of about 5-8 women in a Ladies Weekly Bible Study and it is an excellent book to do a group or do it individually.So if you feel God is wanting to change some \"inside\" things in you, this is the book you want to read.

My only problem in this book is the author uses one conflict in her life over and over again in numerous examples. It seemed a bit repetitive, but it was applicable several different ways.

Two months, I suppose. I read another book by this author, \"Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World,\" and it was very good and I wanted more of the same. A few of the chapters were not as interesting as the first book, maybe even a little too cliche like if there is such a phrase. The good chapters (totally subjective, of course) made up for it, however. Alot was said about Flesh Woman (the natural man's bride, I guess). We all battle flesh woman. She is described as living inside all of us. She's that contrary, rebellious, incredibly self centered version of you who shows up when things don't go the way you planned and life seems habitually unfair (that would be most of the time, I suppose. \"I must warn you, however, that on the surface Flesh Woman doesn't always appear so bad. Instead of wearing leather and tattos, my Flesh Woman prefers lace and carefully coiffured hair. She goes to great lengths to be respectable because she feeds on people's praise and applause. You see, Flesh Woman doesn't need dark alleys and smoky bars to work her worst. I'm discovering she may flourish most in religious surroundings, carefully disguised in church-lady clothes.\"There is some confusion, however, in the author's mind as to how the principle of grace lets Flesh Woman stick around. I would love to explain that to her.My favorite (translate: most needed) chapter is titled \"A Fearless Beauty\" and, yes, deals with fear. \"It's fear that makes us do those slightly crazy, often inappropriate things. Fear that blurts out thoughtless, sometimes hurtful words. Because fear babbles. It freaks out. It searches frantically for explanations and solutions. It races around trying to fix things or, at the very least, figure things out. It fusses and fidgets, messes and obsesses. Fear sews togehter fig leaves to cover our inadequacies and paints bright smiles to hide our tears. It builds makeshift shelters and puts on far too much makeup. It forces us to hide behind facades simply because we don't know what else to do.\"I could quote alot of that chapter because I was freaking out about a problem that was easier to freak out about that just to quietly trust in the Lord to gently almost imperceptibly but quite literally see me through. This chapter brought me back to the reality of trusting the Lord in my specific need not just in a general,academic sort of way. This book was a great spiritual springboard to meditation upon where I am and what I lack spriritually and confidence that I can wrestle down that darn Flesh Woman who would have me fear!

This quote from the book cover well describes the struggle that I, the author, and I expect many others go through on a daily basis - \"At our very core, every one of us is a \"twisted sister\" within whom the flesh and spirit battle constantly for control. We are afflicted with spiritual schizophrenia, the disconnect between our \"good girl\" desire to put Jesus first and our \"bad girl\" realities that crowd our thoughts and push him out of the way\". So often we think that we don't need daily Bible study or daily prayer and that we don't need to attend worship and Bible study groups in order to follow the teachings of Jesus, but without them the \"bad girl\" parts of our personalities and characters often take over. I appreciated the honesty of this author in telling about her own struggles with pride, conceit, and the longing to be 'right' and 'in charge' of various projects or events in her life, and the importance of realizing that God has a plan and we must prayerfully submit to Him. I liked Having a Mary Spirit in a Martha World, but personally found this book much more stimulating for me.

That said, it's a depressing read in some ways- I can't relate to this woman very much and I don't especially like her advice. Being Godly doesn't mean stifling your nature but growing into who God wants you to be. Chapter 14 was troubling. A Woman who calls another stupid in the name of 'Speaking the truth in love' is not chastised but praised and there's a sense that love means telling people mean, judgmental things. No thanks- not my idea of Godly love. There's a lot of emphasis throughout the book on shame. To me that is really backward and not affirming. I do like the study guides and the use of readings throughout but I don't think this is a very strong book. It's a bit fundamentalist in the understanding of Scripture as well without taking context and history into consideration when recounting certain passages.
