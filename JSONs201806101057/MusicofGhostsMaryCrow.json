Not a chill this time, but a noise. And not even a noise so much as an absence of noise in the way that birds grow quiet when a predator nears . . . Mary tensed . . . She stood there listening when suddenly she heard a series of high-pitched sounds . . . The hair lifted on the back of her neck. Someone was up here, playing a fiddle.\u201dMary Crow is a level headed down-to-earth attorney who\u2019s known as an extremely bright and fierce legal opponent. She doesn't back down and she doesn't spook easily. But her current case might be the exception. The Appalachian region is ripe with Cherokee spirit-legends and Irish/Scottish ghost stories, but Mary is certain the old \u2018Fiddlesticks Cabin\u2019 isn't haunted. Creepy, oh yes! Repugnant - that too. But haunted? No. Whoever murdered and maimed Lisa Wilson (the former governor\u2019s daughter) is definitely a living breathing individual, albeit a very deranged one, but certainly not a ghost. Mary's highly educated/esteemed raptor client, Nick Stratton, isn't guilty either \u2013 though the bulk of circumstantial evidence along with the former governor\u2019s ball-busting-vengeance demands an indictment that says otherwise. Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, in more ways than one. The fiddlers play on. Not only is the victim\u2019s father cracking his political-prowess whip, a vicious tabloid reporter is out to ruin Mary\u2019s reputation and possible career. Then too, Mary\u2019s family life is caught in another sort of cross-hairs \u2013 with her stepchild\u2019s welfare hanging in the balance. From the hollows and backwoods south of Asheville, to the red earth land of Oklahoma, this is one heck of a great mystery/suspense ride - my first by Sallie Bissell, but not my last. Bissell does a remarkable job portraying regional nuances, emotionally-charged and spine-tingling atmospheres, and she gives credibility to well-developed diverse characters.Aside from a bit of crass language and minor lewd references, I thoroughly enjoyed \u201cMusic of Ghosts.\u201d It\u2019s regionally distinct, tightly-written, realistic, plausible and engaging. I\u2019m delighted to have found this Appalachian-noir legal whodunit at my local Friends of the Library Bookstore, in perfect condition - a win-win for me and my community."}, {"userName": "Thing Two", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722823-thing-two", "userReview": "I always enjoy reading about Mary Crow.

Then you can come back new.\u201dWhen Mary Crow promised her longtime lover that she would no longer handle criminal cases, she never expected a murder to land at her front door. When the daughter of a prominent politician is found fatally victimized and her boss is charged with the crime, Mary is placed in the intractable position of proving his defense even though she knows it could cause her to lose everything that matters to her.As Mary divulges deeper into the crime, she finds herself embroiled in a centuries old mystery that stems from a similar murder that occurred 1958 and a ghost story that still haunts the Appalachians surrounding her town. She is also having to deal with personal issues when her lover and his nine year old daughter return from a court ordered visit with her grandparents changed and suddenly acting cold towards her. With the help of the local sheriff\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and friends from her time as a prosecutor, Mary will learn the hard way that blood is thicker than water and often times the ghosts of our pasts are never truly laid to rest.Music Of Ghosts is the fifth installment in Sallie Bissell\u2019s Mary Crow series. A suspenseful mystery series whose protagonist, Mary Crow, is a Cherokee lawyer whose penchant for trouble follows her around like a shadow. Even if you haven\u2019t read the first four, the story line\u2019s crisp clean lines and smooth telling allows for instant comprehension and immersion. Heavily character driven with a multitude of twists and turns, lore inspired mystery and suspense builds slowly, intertwining with an on going deeply rooted romance that is not without its own drama.Set in a small mountain town of North Carolina\u2019s Pisgah County, legend and lore winds together to give us a well written personal glimpse into small town life and the reservations and prejudices that often come with it. I enjoyed meeting Mary and seeing the effort she has made to conform her life to the expectations of her lover, Jonathan Walkingstick. An intelligent and admirable woman, she has sacrificed so much of herself to be with him. A decision she didn\u2019t make lightly nor does she regret. My heart broke for her when Jonathan places his own needs and wants above hers and isn\u2019t there when she needs him most of all.The secondary characters round out the storyline and further encourage the appeal of this story. Offering up a smattering of humor and eccentricity, I found myself engaging with them all. Everyone has a place in the story, be it large or small, and isn\u2019t used as unnecessary filler. Bissell cleverly uses this small town appeal and eccentricity to keep us on our toes as we are given various clues to both mysteries while keeping our villain hidden right before our eyes.The ending is an action packed finale that answers all our questions and wraps up the mysteries nice and neat. Mary\u2019s personal life doesn\u2019t wrap up as neatly and we are left with more questions than answers. Hopefully Ms. Bissell will not wait eight years to write book six.Ms. Bissell\u2019s Music of Ghosts is a enjoyable suspense thriller that will appeal to all readers who enjoy the thrill of a good small town mystery with a strong engaging female protagonist.Overall Rating: B"}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "3.5 North Carolina, the hollers of the Appalachians, their myths and folklore and fiddle music make up the story in this new novel featuring Mary Crow.

Good combination of story-line and personal life, both which are very interesting. Love the setting and it is described so well one can picture themselves in the place and time.

The characters are well defined and I had no idea of where the story was going in her personal and professional life. The drama was going till the end. Some of it I did not like but hopefully thier will be another book out soon. The Suspense held up for me. I did not guess who the murder was or how.Once I started reading I did not put the book down till it was done. I liked the story and look forward to reading more Mary Crow stories in the future. Mary Crow is a lawyer, who helped her county get a sports park built. Mary was at the grand opening ceramony and she was worried that her family did not come for it. They did. Mary lives with her boyfriend Jonathon Walkingstick and his nine year old daughter. They have been together for years. This past month since they got back from a month visit with his daughter's grandparents at court order visit they both had changed toward her. Mary is afraid Jonathon has found someone else while he was gone.The day before the sports park opened a bunch of collage interns at raptor rehab center went up to camp at a old haunted house back in the country. One of the girls was then murdered up thier. The Sherrif went up to the murder scene instead of welcoming the Governor of North Carolina for the ribbon ceramony. He found out that Lisa was killed and had carvings all over her body. Lisa was also a daughter of a former North Carolina Governor. He now had a high profile case on his hands. Mary Crow no longer did murder cases because Jonathon had asked her not to while his daughter lived at home. When things were falling apart in her personal life Nick Stratton asked her to represent him. She took the case. Mary unraveled it piece by piece while waiting for her own personal life hang in the balance with the help of good friends she found the answers.I have the feeling that a lot of Mary's friends have been in earlier books. I know I would like to read them sometime in the future. If your a Mary Crow fan I think you will like this. If you like mysteries that keep you guessing this will be a good one to read.I was given this ebook to read and asked to give a honest review in return from Netgalley.04/08/2012 PUB Midnight Ink ISBN9780738735849 384 pagesDescription below taken off of Netgalley.comAn Appalachian ghost legend scares up a grisly murderDeep in the Appalachian woods stands the old Fiddlesticks cabin, the scene of a bloody double murder from decades past.

One such visit ends tragically when a college student is strangled to death \u2014 her flesh mutilated with bizarre symbols. The victim is Lisa Wilson, daughter of a former North Carolina governor.

This is the only one of the Mary Crow series that I have read thus far but I will certainly be reading others to catch up! Mary is an attorney in Pisgah County, North Carolina who is trying to balance her professional and personal life. She lives with Jonathan ( a member of the Cherokee nation) and is helping to raise his daughter Lily. However, Lily's maternal grandparents are fighting for custody and Mary's personal life is in chaos. Soon her professional life becomes complicated when an acquaintance is accused of murder.Hidden away in the nearby Appalachian woods sits an abandoned cabin where years ago a man nicknamed Fiddlesticks murdered his wife and her lover. Though Fiddlesticks was convicted and executed for the crime, many locals still think they hear his fiddle playing and steer clear of the abandoned cabin. When a group of college students interning at the Pisgah Raptor Rescue Center decide to spend the night in the cabin and try to record the eerie fiddle music and ghost, one of their group is found brutally murdered. Lisa Wilson, the victim, is also the daughter of a former North Carolina governor which complicates the life of local sheriff (and friend of Mary Crow), Jerry Cochran. The ensemble of characters are well drawn and the reader is deftly brought up to speed in case you are new to the series. Much local color and history enhance the murder mystery, the clues fairly divulged and the solution believable and satisfying. Music of Ghosts will keep you in suspense to the end, then send you looking for another of the Mary Crow books."}, {"userName": "Angela Risner", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9972516-angela-risner", "userReview": "This is the first novel of Sallie Bissell's that I've read, and I have to say, I'm hooked! I'm only ticked, because the rest of the series is not available in eBook format. Normally I don't read a series out of order. When I first started reading this book, I hemmed and hawed about whether or not I really wanted to order the rest of the series in printed format. But as I continued on, I made the decision that I wanted to read the entire series. So the first four books are on their way here. In this book, attorney Mary Crow, who has made a promise to her domestic partner, Jonathan that she won't work on murder trials anymore, finds herself helpless when the grandparents of her step-daughter sue Jonathan for custody. If you've read the series, you know the back story there. Mary is the person to whom they object, so she has to step aside while Jonathan and the grandparents duke it out in Oklahoma family court. When the murder of the daughter of a former governor takes place nearby, Mary finds herself drawn to defend the accused man, which reignites her love for being a trial attorney. For not knowing the series, I thought that it was fairly easy to pick up on some of the history with the characters and to find them engaging. Still, I look forward to going back to the beginning of the series and learning the full history. I think Mary (at least in this book) is a great character. She's smart and her responses to situations are realistic. Jonathan leaves me wanting, but this is my only introduction to him as a character, so that may change as I read the rest of the series. If it's worth me ordering the printed editions to read the rest of the series, you know it's good stuff. Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "A Book Vacation", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3558850-a-book-vacation", "userReview": "To see my full review:http://wp.me/p1jhaj-2S4This mystery novel was a ton of fun to read. I really enjoyed getting to know all the characters, especially as Bissell deeply fleshed them out for her readers. This is my first Mary Crow novel, though it\u2019s number five in the series, and what I really enjoyed was that this is a stand alone novel in which we get to know Mary Crow very well, regardless of whether we\u2019ve read the other novels. While I do love series novels that build off of each other, I also really enjoy the stand alone, and was very happy to see that this was the case with the Mary Crow novels.Bissell opens The Music of Ghosts with a bewildering murder, thrusting readers into the chaos as we watch and learn about Lisa Wilson and the events leading up to her untimely demise. I really liked the way Bissell did this as, truth be told, I wasn\u2019t really a fan of Lisa, but I was interested in her and her friends, and their sleuthing of the abandoned Fiddlesticks cabin piqued my interest from the very first page. With Lisa out of the way, the novel moves quickly into a case of whodunit as the five surviving members in the cabin, as well as the others who had contact with Lisa throughout the summer, become prime suspects. Enter Mary Crow. Struggling with her own set of problems and her promise to never take a murder case, Mary must decide whether or not to follow her gut and, in so doing, brings about the demise of some, including former relationships, and the triumph of others.This novel is a rollercoaster ride of emotions, focusing on Mary\u2019s heartbreak, Jerry\u2019s murder case, Nick\u2019s innocence, and the very real possibility that someone very near to the Fiddlesticks murders is exacting their revenge. Bissell kept me guessing the whole time."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/908657-laura", "userReview": "This was an incredibly interesting story that grabbed me from the first chapter. This is the fifth book in the series but the first one I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s the type of book where it might be helpful to have read the other books to get more of the history, but she does a good job of summarizing previous storylines so you aren\u2019t lost. There are two storylines in this book though, which I found a bit distracting but it didn\u2019t detract from the overall quality. One storyline follows the main character Mary Crow and her live-in boyfriend Jonathon Walkingstick and his daughter Lily. After he took her to visit her grandparents they returned sullen and quiet. It turns out he is being sued by her grandparents for custody. In the other story, we have a girl murdered outside a reportedly haunted cabin where she and her friends were staying the night. She had strange symbols carved into her body, which leave the sheriff puzzled and her former governor father angry and looking for blood. They rush to arrest a man who protests his innocence and is then represented by Mary Crow. I liked the various voices telling this story to get everyone\u2019s point of view, it adds an extra dimension.

As she is being pulled deeper and deeper into the case, her boyfriend, Jonathan, is being pulled in another direction with his daughter. At first, I thought that Music of Ghosts, might be more of a horror novel, with their being actual ghosts, but it soon shown itself to be a murder mystery with plenty of twists and turns along the way.

This book packs the perfect amount of thrills and page-turning to keep you reading until the last page.

Killed in an old cabin in which a heinous double-homicide occurred decades before, local lore factors heavily into the investigation. The plot was complex and wove in a personal story line involving Crow's long-time boyfriend and his young daughter, a music tradition indigenous to Appalachia, and Cherokee lore.
