Burke has an elegant prose and his main character, David Robicheaux, is engaging.\n\nRobicheaux is a 50-something hard boiled detective who survived the Vietnam War yet is still haunted by it and thus turns to drinking (though it becomes evident later he was drinking before he went to war). He has since joined the police force as a detective and has a corrupt partner named Cletus who seems to have the best, crude lines. In this first novel Robicheaux gets caught up in the death of a black prostitute who everybody else seems to want to write off yet Robicheaux feels strangely compelled to poke his nose into things which leads to resistance not only from the mob but his own allies the police. The tale was certainly very good to great in overall quality and most of the characters are believable to compelling. Word on the street is that the series gets better in time and that's a real good sign as this was a solid and enjoyable book. Veterans of this genre will be more critical, I suspect. This is one of those rare instances in which I checked out the series after seeing the movie. \nI would present that the real strengths of this tale (other than it being a solid mystery) are its usual focuses upon the bayou, New Orleans (NOLA) and DR's alcoholism for a dark tragedy comes down upon him and he finds himself drinking that \"golden fire\" once more (he alludes to drinking before the series started and having an alcoholic father). Rarely have I read something that has made me understand the addictions of alcohol and how hard it is to shake off. But even all those reading pleasures are a still a notch down from the character of New Orleans/The Bayou with its balmy heat waves, summer rains, Poorboy sandwiches, evening skies that are the color of torn plums, cicadas in the purple haze, fireflies lighting up the trees, and, of course, the charm of not just New Orleans but its French Quarter. That makes it a pleasure to read and bumps up the overall quality of the novel. I look forward to reading the next one.\n Here are few excerpts from the novel: p. 1\tThe evening sky was streaked with purple, the color of torn plums, and a light rain had started to fall when I came to the end of the blacktop road that cut through twenty miles of thick, almost impenetrable scrub oak and pine and stopped at the front gate of Angola penitentiary.p. 49\t\u201cOh, my, you shouldn't have done that,\u201d the man in the raincoat said.\tErik grabbed my hair and slammed my head against the side of the tub. I kicked at all of them blindly, but my feet struck at empty air. Then Bobby Joe locked his powerful arms around my neck and took me over the rim again, his body trembling rigidly with a cruel and murderous energy, and I knew that all my past fears of being shotgunned by a psychotic , of being shanked by an addict, of stepping on a Claymore mine in Vietnam, were just the foolish preoccupation of youth; that my real nemesis had always been a redneck lover who would hold me upside down against his chest while my soul slipped through a green, watery porcelain hole in the earth, down through the depths of the Mekong River, where floated the bodies of other fatigue-clad men and whole families of civilians, their faces still filled with disbelief and the shock of an artillery burst, and farther still to the mossy base of an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, where my father waited for me in his hardhat, coveralls, and steel-tipped drilling boots after having drowned there twenty years ago.p. 80\t\u201cWhy are you so obnoxious, Motley?\u201d Clete said. \u201cIs it because you're fat and ugly, or is it because you're fat and dumb? It's a mystery to us all.\u201dp. 121\tI slept through the rest of the afternoon and woke in the cooling dusk when the cicadas were loud in the purple haze and the fireflies were lighting in the trees. I showered and felt some of the misery begin to go out of my mind and body, then I took a taxi to the Hertz agency and rented a small Ford.Because most of the Quarter was closed to automobile traffic at night, I parked the car near the French Market, by the river, and walked back to Bourbon. The street was loud with music from the bars and strip houses, and the sidewalks were filled with tourists, drunks, and street people who were trying to hold on to their last little piece of American geography. My favorite bunch of hustlers and scam artists, the black sidewalk tap dancers, were out in force. They wore enormous iron taps that clipped onto their shoes, and when they danced to the music from the bars, their feet rang on the concrete like horseshoes. A tap dancer would stop a tourist, rivet him in the eyes, and say, \u201cI bet you a half-dollar I can tell you where you got yo' shoes.\u201d If the tourist accepted the wager, the dancer would then say, \u201cYou got yo' shoes on yo' feet, and yo' feet is on Bourbon Street.

I'm changing it to too many great writers, too little time. The first book I read by James Lee Burke was Wayfaring Stranger. I read it before it was published in July of 2014 because I received an advance reading copy from the publisher. It was an unbelievably good book and I wanted to read more from this author. So here it is August of 2017 and I have just finished my second book by James Lee Burke. How could I let so many years go by without reading another book by this great author? It's not like I only read occasionally. I always have a book going if not 2 or3. There are always new authors coming on the horizon and the older ones are still there. I guess that I should consider myself lucky to have so many choices,Neon Rain is James Lee Burke's first Dave Robicheaux book and I knew before reading it that he survived because of all the Dave Robicheaux series that came after. Like all the detective novels this one pits the good guys against the bad guys, but sometimes the line between the two gets blurred. But outside that usual plot line, James Lee Burke paints vivid pictures of New Orleans so that I felt like I was actually there enjoying the sights, sounds and smells. I will take a pass on the \"poor-boy sandwiches dripping with shrimp and oysters\" that Dave seems to love. He lives on a houseboat, reminiscent of the Travis McGee novels by John D. MacDonald that I read so many years ago. Dave Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic who attends AA meetings but is always one step away from a drunk.We are introduced to his half-brother Jimmie, who is the son of a whore that their father frequented. They are raised by their father, a poor Cajun who loved and cared for his boys the best he could. Dave and Jimmie love each other as only brothers can despite the fact that they have gone down different paths. When someone tries to take Jimmie out there is nothing that will get in the way of Dave bringing them down.He stick his nose in where the government doesn't want it but Dave Robicheaux doesn't care. He wants to see that justice, as he defines it, is done. He ends up getting involved in Nicaraguan politics because he wants to see justice done for a young, black hooker who ends up dead because she too unknowingly gets in the middle of this political game.In the end Dave Robicheaux lives to fight another day. As we leave them, he and his girl, Annie, are sailing off into the sunset on his houseboat which is being towed to a new location. I felt that the plot of this book was secondary to setting the scene for future novels in this series. You definitely have to read this book before you can read any of the others. I am fascinated by the thought of getting to know Dave Robicheaux better."}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "3.5After reading six Holland Family novels I just had to start this series. I began with a bit of trepidation because I knew those books would be a hard act to follow. Here's what happened.It took me right back to New Orleans which I visited about the time the novel was written.It opened a hardcore window into a man\u2019s soul as he daily struggles to say no to the siren call of alcoholism.It brought back all the reasons I participated in anti-Vietnam War marches, though I really had no honest clue at the time.It was sick with violence, oh so dark, made me wince; so why read it? The unpalatable can be endured because the man can write. His deeply flawed protagonists burrow in deep as you struggle right alongside with them. I was clipping my dogs nails the other day after giving her a sedative. As my husband was holding her and whispering sweet things in her ear she just surrendered and enjoyed the whole process.JLB does that to you with his prose, even when telling you about a guy getting tortured and killed. He can keep the reader in a state of animated reading enjoyment even when the story gets chaotic with all the myriad characters and heat going down as it did with this one. It did not have the same impact on me as the ones that came before and my rating reflects that, but I\u2019m certain the series will keep getting better\u2014after all it\u2019s been going strong for a quarter of a century. I intend to find out for myself if Dave and I will get a thing goin' and let ya\u2019ll know."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "I know an author setting a book in a city known for its food like New Orleans would really want to get the regional flavor across by having the characters chow down on the local cuisine, but do they really eat that many po\u2019 boy sandwiches down there? Hell, I\u2019m from Kansas City, but I don\u2019t eat barbecue every day. James Lee Burke kicked off this long running crime series back in the late \u201880s. Dave Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic, a Vietnam vet (Yet again confirming my theory that all tough guy hero characters created in the \u201880s are Vietnam vets.), and a police lieutenant in New Orleans. When a death row inmate tells Dave that someone has put a contract out on his life, Dave finds it hard to believe that anything he\u2019s working on would rate someone trying to kill a police officer. However, it\u2019s not one of his cases that have caused Dave problems. While fishing in a rural area, Dave had found a woman\u2019s body in the water and called in the local sheriff\u2019s office. When he found that the sheriff had the body cremated without an autopsy, Dave got curious. It\u2019s that curiosity that lands Dave in all kinds of hot water with local gangsters, crooked cops and some creepy covert types who are tied in with some shennigans in Central America. Dave has to fend off attempts on his life while his career is also threatened, and the temptation of the bottle may lead him into even further trouble.I spent a few weeks in New Orleans shortly after Katrina, so it was hard not to wince a bit while reading this because Burke wrote Dave as being a native who genuinely loves his city. The long descriptions of various locales had me constantly wondering if they were still there as I remembered the damage I saw. So this is a book that later events have added a bittersweet vibe to.Overall, I enjoyed the story. Dave reminded me a bit of Matt Scudder with the alcoholic angle and with his being a good guy, but not someone out to change the world. The character, setting and main story were all intriguing. However, I didn\u2019t like the romance angle added in with Dave meeting and getting a new girlfriend right as the action ramped up. Would any woman really keep going out with a guy after they both get assaulted and nearly killed on their first date? Plus, Dave makes a series of decisions late in the book that seem downright stupid.Still, this was a gritty crime story with Cajun flavor. I need to read more Dave\u2019s stories."}, {"userName": "Bill  Kerwin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin", "userReview": "Great Louisiana atmosphere and a good deal of violence in this, the first of the Dave Robicheaux mysteries.

I would have remained in this completely unaware state had it not been for my praise of Will Patton\u2019s narration of Doctor Sleep, a fellow blogger recommended his narration of the Robicheaux series, so I looked into it and lo and behold, I find three of my favourite authors hold him in very high regard and two of them recommended his books to me. So got to be worth a try, right.The Neon Rain is fast approaching thirty years old but that didn\u2019t matter in the slightest, as I was completely blown away by a story I just couldn\u2019t stop listening to. Dave Robicheaux\u2019s tale is filled with twists and turns, a bared back torture scene that he is lucky to escape from, the mafia, drugs, weapons smuggling and a personnel life that gets you deeply inside the character. I was that invested in the story, I found myself intensely disappointed in him when he jumped off the wagon and hit the bottle with a vengeance. His life is absolutely fascinating, intricate and complex with a gritty darkness that is never far away. He has a dynamic, sometimes forceful persistence to his personality and the forthright dialogue was intriguing in a way that, well I guess everyone wishes they could say exactly what needed to be said, every time instead of forever hiding. Robicheaux has the quick answers and intelligence to match, he tells it like it is, in a way that you and I would only think of after the conversation was long finished. I loved everything about this book, the main character, the setting, the dialogue all blended seamlessly with a compelling prose, that Will Patton turned into something special.

From the almost 60 pages I got through, I can understand that. I didn't abandon this novel because I thought the writing anything less than top notch. The dialogue seems authentic and distinctive, there are descriptions of Louisiana that are evocative and lyrical coming through the first person narrative. This isn't rated two stars because I think it's mediocre--it's simply I couldn't stomach it. Too dark, too gritty, too violent. I've got through some dark books--but this one didn't have glints of humor nor did the narrator/protagonist, Dave Robicheaux, provide any moral center. Around page 50 or so, Dave is being tortured--water boarded essentially--by what he recognizes as \"spook\" types. Problem was, by then, I couldn't see any moral distinction between their abuse of power and what he and his partner had done as cops in roughing up and threatening a potential witness and a bodyguard. I just felt assaulted by the book--the obscenities, the gritty, corrupt world, the violence. From what I read this might possibly be a good, even powerful book--but if, like me, your tolerance for the low-down dark side isn't high, you might want to skip this one."}, {"userName": "Karl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1935255-karl", "userReview": "I bought about five copies of the hard cover and passed them out to my friends.

Undoubtedly gritty and often quite violent, The Neon Rain still managed to surprise me with a generous amount of almost poetic prose that was completely unexpected. The sense of atmosphere is almost dripping off the pages at times and really drew me into the New Orleans setting. \"The streetlamps lighted the misty trees along the esplanade on St. Charles; the burnished streetcar tracks and the old green streetcar glistened dully in the wet light, and the smoky neon signs, the bright, rain-streaked windows of the restaurants and the drugstore on the corner were like part of a nocturnal painting out of the 1940's. This part of New Orleans never seemed to change, and somehow its confirmation of yesterday on a rainy summer night always dissipated my own fears about time and mortality.\"Detective Dave Robicheaux is a fantastically flawed individual and the characterization here is top notch. A Vietnam vet with a history of alcoholism, Dave grew up in a broken home with his brother and his rough-around-the-edges but loving father. With a mother that abandoned him and a wife that dumped him, Dave is not a stranger to loneliness. I loved reading his philosophical reflections on life in the midst of a somewhat chaotic plot. Mobsters, drug lords, dirty cops, federal agents and creepy bad guys of all sorts pop up all over the place and I admit to becoming a bit confused from time to time. But that didn't really take much away from my appreciation for this novel. I enjoyed seeing the tender side of this guy as he attempted to kindle some romance in his life with a young woman named Annie. Annie had to endure more than her due share of drama as a result of her entanglement with Dave! It was also interesting to learn more about the demons that haunt an ex-alcoholic and what it is like for a woman involved with a man with such a history. \"\u2026 the truth was that I wanted to drink. And I don't mean I wanted to ease back into it, either, with casual Manhattans sipped at a mahogany and brass-rail bar with red leather booths and rows of gleaming glasses stacked in front of a long wall mirror. I wanted busthead boilermakers of Jack Daniel's and draft beer, vodka on the rocks, Beam straight up with water on the side, raw tequila that left you breathless and boiling in your own juices.\"If you want to know what really happens in this book, you can read the brief blurb and it won't spoil anything for you. What I can recommend is that you read this for Burke's superb narrative and character development. This is violent and gruesome at times, so if that is not your thing, then I would say either read it and cringe from time to time as I did, or perhaps steer clear altogether!

The author has a gift. He paints a picture with words and I felt like I was in New Orleans experiencing the sights, sounds, and food. This is the first novel in the series featuring Dave Robicheaux, a detective with the New Orleans police department. He is battling many demons. He is a Vietnam veteran who often has flashbacks to his experiences during the war. He is a recovering alcoholic. His wife left him for another man. And in his job he deals with the worst in humanity and violent crimes. He must see and experience things most people do not have to and he brings these home with him at the end of the day. He is also a man of principle. When he discovers the body of a young prostitute in a bayou and the local police department is prepared to write it off as a simple drowning he pushes back. His investigation takes him into the seedy world of pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, and arms dealers. His recovery, which is only a daily reprieve, is endangered as is his career and a new relationship he is in.I think it is the flaws and demons that Dave Robicheaux must deal with that make him such a compelling character. Some quotes from the book:\"... I knew that simian creature we descend from was alive and well in my breast\"\"I decided that my temptation for alcohol and self-destruction was maybe even an indication that my humanity was still intact\"\"And I also knew that to be free of the tiger you sometimes had to look right into the beaded orange light of the eye\"There is a lot of violence in James Lee Burke's New Orleans.

It was the first James lee Burke offering I had read, and I certainly have mixed feelings about it. There's no doubt that Burke can write very well; he develops interesting characters and creates some brilliant dialogue for them. It could have been a really good book but had some flaws that spoiled it for me, just a little. I say flaws for want of a better word; perhaps shortcomings would be a better term. I am perfectly aware that other people might not be bothered by them at all.To begin with, the book was published back in the '80s and that, essentially, was a whole generation back. This doesn't have to be an obstacle, so long as you bear that in mind when reading it. The book has aged not too badly. The biggest problem I had with this mystery was the unrealistic plot. Robicheaux has a tendency to be captured (and re-captured) by his antagonists and is continually escaping death by the slimmest of margins. It just got to be too much.Another buzz-kill is the fact that I am so sick and flipping tired of the tendency common in the mass entertainment media to condone the use of torture and murder by police officers during the execution of their duties. These acts of violence have become common fare on television and in movies and, of course, in the pages of the books we read. I know some of this happens in the real world, but I can't help but believe that life imitates art to a certain extent. Robicheaux and colleagues murder and torture and this fact put me off the book a bit.I would have five-starred this for writing and two-starred it for plot. It ends up with what I feel may be an over-generous four stars.I'll probably go on to read another book in this series, just to be sure.

We have most of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux novels and my edition is a yellowed paperback, different edition from this one pictured. I started reading it again because it was listed in Amazon's 100 lifetime must-read mysteries. It's still good and so far not too dated to be entertaining.* * * * *The book was okay and Burke is very descriptive of N'Orleans, but I didn't find Dave to be a very sympathetic character. There was a lot of useless murder and bloodshed and some long-winded, esoteric flashbacks of Dave's past that didn't add much to the storyline.* * * * *7/15/17 - Okay, on my second reading I've upped the rating from two to three stars. As I mentioned before, I've softened my attitude a bit towards Dave, though I still don't find him to be a very sympathetic character. Today I'm going to start the second in the series, _Heaven's Prisoners_, which was made into a movie starring Alec Baldwin. I haven't seen the movie.Some favorite lines:\"They were big men, probably Cajuns like myself, but their powerful and sinewy bodies, their tight-fitting, powder-blue uniforms, polished gunbelts and holsters, glinting bullets and revolver butts made you think of backwoods Mississippi and northern Louisiana, as though they had to go away to learn redneck cruelty.\" Very descriptive!\". . . he treated his equals as well as his inferiors with respect. . . \"\". . . her face had a lovely childlike quality in it while she played her music, the kind you see in people who seem to go through a photogenic transformation when they do that private thing that they hold separate for themselves.\"\"It's always today, Jim. . .\" Indeed!

When I heard there is some sort of fan club for this Dave Robicheaux guy, I was curious to see if I'll join. :-) It turns out my library overdrive has quite a few of the Robicheaux books in the series, so I started with no 1. First of all, I must confess that my attention was not the best. So, as my rating tells you, I enjoyed it, although I didn't find it riveting. If anything, although I don't read this genre often, the story was very familiar: damaged cop, ex Vietnam soldier, with PTSD and addiction problems; divorced; not doing things by the book, but he's a \"straight shooter\" with a strong moral compass. I felt like I've read/seen this story before. I've got the ARC of the latest Robicheaux instalment, so I'm curious to see how much Robicheaux changed over twenty! volumes.The narrator of this audiobook and, apparently, of all Burke books is Will Patton, who was excellent.

I'm a huge fan of beautiful prose, and Burke provides that here in large helpings. If you want tons of atmosphere, lots of poetic phrasing, and a loving sense of place, you can't do much better. And then there's the characters with their regionally flavored dialogue and, in audio format, accents to enjoy. IMHO Burke's books are especially enjoyable in audio, because of all the regional flavors and the natural cadences inherent in his writing. It's a pleasure to listen to his words spoken out loud. Fortunately, the two major narrators of the Robicheaux novels -- Will Patton and Mark Hammer -- both do great jobs at bringing Burke's words to life. I personally prefer Hammer's vocal timbre and style for Robicheaux -- he has a rough, world-weary sound that fits Dave perfectly -- but Patton is very good as well, and he also has the advantage of being a native Southerner.But enough about narrators and prose. This book is very violent and even gory in spots -- I don't like to post spoilers in reviews, but I will say that entrails and pigs are involved at one point -- yet there is never any sensationalism or sense of glorifying the violence. In fact, these books usually seem restrained and thoughtful to me even in the midst of the violent episodes. These qualities are reflected in the character of Dave Robicheaux himself. Dave is a battle-scarred war veteran and recovering alcoholic who kills two people during the story and physically attacks several others, but we never see him raging or fuming or boasting or revelling in what he's doing. This is a guy who simply sees his goal and then does what needs to be done in order to get there. Dave is the kind of person who quotes Robert Frost and reads E.M. Forster, then takes his girlfriend out to the races and falls in love, all while his life is falling apart around him. I always get the sense that there's a lot more going on in Dave's head than he tells us about, or maybe more than he knows about himself -- but that really just increases the fascination for me. I'd love to see a few chapters from someone else's POV some time, because I suspect that Dave looks much different to others than he does to himself. As for the plot -- well, yes, there is a plot. Others may disagree, but I feel as though the overall plotline is not really the point in Burke's books. The Robicheaux novels really seem to be mostly about what Dave goes through and how he reacts to his experiences, with less emphasis on how all the pieces fit together into the Big Picture. It may just be me, especially since I'm a total sucker for character in addition to my love for good prose, but that is my persistent impression. So if you like to read books with really strong plots, that may be a weakness for you.Well, this review has turned out to be longer than I expected, so I'll wrap it up. Over all, this is my kinda writing. And I'm not alone in appreciating it. Burke has won two Edgar awards for novels plus the Edgar Grand Master award, as well as one Gold Dagger, and one of his novels was even nominated for the Pulitzer. I can't wait to see what Burke does with Dave over the course of the series, and I'll definitely be reading several more of these books. And, lucky me, Burke has also written two other series, as well as several standalone novels. I won't be running out of his books any time soon. :)"}, {"userName": "Cathy DuPont", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6637209-cathy-dupont", "userReview": "Unfortunately, I read Black Cherry Blues first, then this one and I really like to read character series in order. Too late to complain now. Should have done better research.Liked this book a lot and had to go through a thought process to determine four or five stars. Wish I could have halfs because I would have upped it to four and one half stars. Settled on four after waffling for a few minutes. I really liked the book though and it set up the Dave Robicheaux character with more background info. This guy is something else in that he really goes by his own rules, his own idea of morality, and don't get in his way when you're on the wrong side. Let me say though, his humanity is visible but if you're the bad guy and he knows it, better move to another town and change your name. Dave has his own rule book and he will hunt you down and come after you. In the last 50 pages or so I started thinking about the lovely descriptions of the landscape, (it's set in New Orleans and the bayous) how Robicheaux makes decisions and how he decides what is important to him. Burke's writing was almost poetic, prose like, and lyrical in some instances. I have a fondness for such writing so it really captured my imagination although it was the end. It was after all the violence and the final outcome and then this lovely use of the English language. Calmness after all that violence. Nice job, James Lee Burke, and now I know why you have such great following.

Well that was me looking all stupid. If anything Mr Burke does know how to write a complex story as well, and he brings the Bayous and New Orleans to life on paper. It is my biggest failure of of not visiting the Big Easy before Kathrina and somehow the writer does bring that lost world back to life.Dave Robicheaux, a brilliant name, visits a man on dead row and finds out he might have some dead sentence of his own hanging over his head. Which he finds out has a lot to do with him pressing the case of some dead girl fished out of the bayou and him disagreeing about the cause of dead. The story contains some references to a war in Middle America which might be unfamiliar to readers of a younger age, just look it up if you want to learn more about stupid US foreign interventions. It is a pretty tough story with some serious violence but also some brilliant insight in the addiction to alcohol. Among all of this DR remains a beacon of hope even if all of this mess started with him having principles. As a detective / mystery something very dark and powerful, mostly due to some very good writing.

I enjoyed this book. I did the audio and loved the narrator. He did a super job with all the different accents and this completely added to my enjoyment. Since this is my first experience with this author, I didn't know what to expect. I will definitely read more by him. His writing was fun to pay attention to. He periodically punctuated the story with some extremely frilly flourishes, but I loved that. He had a great way with words. It was colorful. And yet in other areas, he showed a great economy of word usage. I was intrigued by this type of writing. It ebbed and flowed nicely. The story was kind of dark in places, but it didn't feel like an exhibition. Again, the writing worked here. It kept this tightly controlled. While this isn't usually a story I'd gravitate to, I felt I could understand the characters in their own world.

My eyes glazed over the fourth time our hero was beaten up and I found myself paying less attention to the prose style and more to the endless stream of events, in the hope that soon the book would end.I have six more novels from Burke on the shelf but they're all going back to the secondhand bookdealer without being read, life is too short to read this stuff when there are dozens of great authors with dozens of novels in their back catalogue to savour.

A look at his past arrests is not very helpful in pinpointing the culprits, but it gives the readers an early indication of the sort of hard-boiled, gritty and dangerous journey we are about to embark on: I went through my case file and didn't see any connection. I had a whole file drawer of misery to look at, too: a prostitute icepicked by a psychotic john; a seventeen-year-old runaway whose father wouldn't bond him out of jail and who was hanged the next morning by his black cellmate; a murder witness beaten to death with a ball-peen hammer by the man she was scheduled to testify against; a Vietnamese boat refugee thrown off the roof of the welfare project; three small children shot in their beds by their unemployed father; a junkie strangled with baling wire during a satanic ritual; two homosexual men burned alive when a rejected lover drenched the stairwell of a gay nightclub with gasoline. My drawer was like a microcosm of an aberrant world populated by snipers, razor-wielding blacks, mindless nickel-and-dime boost artists who eventually panic and kill a convenience-store clerk for sixty dollars, and suicides who fill the apartment with gas and blow the whole building into a black and orange fireball.What a bunch to dedicate your life to. With a little help from snitches and other connections to the New Orleans criminal organizations (through his brother) Dave is able to narrow the field of investigation to the recent discovery of a drowned young prostitute. Both the drug lords and his superiors on the Force advise Dave to let it go, as it is not his jurisdiction and there seem to be more serious issues at play, issues going up to federal level, Colombian illegal imports and government support of right wing militias in the Central American republics. But Mr. Robicheaux is not an easy man to push around and to intimidate. When a trio of mysterious goons attack him in the house of his new girlfriend, Dave goes ballistic, Rambo style, takes the law into his own hands and brings the war to the enemy camp.There's no point in giving more details about the plot: it is not as straightforward as I make it sound, and I don't want to spoil the surprises and the outcome of the investigation. It's enough to say that action fans should be really thrilled by the quality of this new series. For me, the opening novel had its ups and downs, but the final balance points towards further study of the possiblities offered by a classical style of noir story told from a modern perspective.I don't usually do a structural analysis, but in this case I find it easier to split my impressions into categories:-  The Mystery  : *** Good, but not all that complicated or surprising. The solution to the case if offered to Dave on a plate by his informers. Only a couple of side issues point to his actual deducting prowess, like the missing spent case from a bullet. Dave Robicheaux comes off the page as a vigilante and not a lawman, a guy who ignores rules and authority and solves his problems with fists, firearms or a sock filled with ball bearings. The bad guys act foolishly, in one of the most common cliches of action thrillers: when they have the hero in their hands, they talk openly about their secrets, invent complicated ways to dispose of him and allow him to live and fight another day, instead of simply putting a bullet through his head. A love interest thrown into the mix feels rushed and mostly gratuitous.-  The Gumshoe  : ***Powerful personality, intriguing motivations, but with a lot of room for improvement. Dave Robicheaux reminds me a little of Harry Hole, another tough guy with atitude problems that failed to convince me in his debut novel. The main problem I had with Dave is not any of his particular vices or habits, but the sum total of these discrete personality traits. Like the Cajun cuisine Dave loves so much, Burke has thrown everything in the pot with a resulting jambalaya of conflicting flavors that often read like overkill and distracts from the credibility of his hero. There is no mystery to the self; we are what we do and where we have been. So we have to ressurect the past constantly, erect monuments to it, and keep it alive in order to remember who we are. So, who is Dave Robicheaux from the perspective of his actions and of his past: Dave is a stand-in for all the harboiled detectives and private investigators that made the genre famous in the 1940s. He is a self-reliant Cajun boy from the bayou ready to deal with anything the big city is throwing his way. He is an alcoholic with a broken marriage. He is a Vietnam veteran nurturing long lasting depression and doubts about his government honesty. He is a Catholic with apragmatic approach to sin, punishment and redemption. He is a gambler who bets regularly on bourre, horse and dog races, looking at love as another sort of gamble. He is a cowboy, a lone wolf, mistrustful of law and order, preferring to make his own sort of rough justice. He is a true Southerner - gourmet, interested in early blues records, living on a houseboat, likes fishing and highbrow literature. Dave is also aware of racial tensions and deep seated prejudice, including among the other cops. There's a lot to like about Dave Robicheaux, but often I felt like I am watching in action a fictional character and not a real person. American readers will probably appreciate more than me the numerous baseball references in the book, but for an European they are the same sort of affectation and slight snobism that the English display about cricket: \"Don't crowd the plate when you don't have to, podna.\" -  The Setting  : ***** Best part of the novel for me. James Lee Burke loves New Orleans and Louisiana, and through his character he is able to share his passion. This is not the first visit I make on the Southern Literary Trail (to paraphrase the name of one of the best groups here on Goodreads), but I was pleasantly surprised at the colourful and authentic vibe the novel has to offer. My favorite passage might explain the title of the first episode, but it also showcases the moody atmosphere and the clear homage the author pais to classic noir titles : The streetlamp lighted the misty trees along the esplanade on St. Charles; the burnished streetcar tracks and the old green streetcar glistened dully in the wet light, and the smoky neon signs, the bright, rain-streaked windows of the restaurants and the drugstore on the corner were like part of a nocturnal painting out of the 1940s. This part of New Orleans never seemed to change, and somehow its confirmation of yesterday on a rainy summer night always dissipated my own fears about time and mortality. -  The Prose  : ****Passages like the one quoted above are easy to find throughout the novel, and the author juggles deftly with the tough street slang and with more introspective passages, even with the occasional flash of black humour ( Spanish fly and Coca-Cola will turn a girl into an instant drive-in-movie nymphomaniac. is one of the suspect pieces of Cajun wisdom shared with us by Dave). Sometimes Dave's rants come close to preaching, in particular his recollections of Vietnam war crimes, but overall I am convinced that James Lee Burke is a major talent and I have high expectations from later books in the series.-  The Pacing  : ***Good page turner, but uneven in places, bogged down in lengthy childhood or Vietnam reminiscences for Dave Robicheaux. After reading a couple of very tightly written crime novels recently, \"Neon Rain\" feels either padded or trying too hard to be multi-layered and deep.Recommended, but Burke has strong competition from John D MacDonald and James Sallis when I will eventually decide to pick up my next Southern Noir."}, {"userName": "Writerlibrarian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116025-writerlibrarian", "userReview": "Gripping and raw.

How I missed out on him to this point is a mystery to me. Anyway, I just made it through 'Neon Rain' and it's first-rate. Lots of action, great writing and dialogue, an exotic locale (New Orleans), an ever-broadening plot and complicated relationships combine to make this a mystery/crime novel I couldn't put down. A New Orleans detective becomes involved in a murder case outside his jurisdiction, which leads into internal conflicts in his department, contact with some really nasty criminals, and even CIA involvement. It was published in 1987 and hearkens back to the time in American 'justice' when roughing up criminals and playing both sides were a little more common among the police than nowadays. Kind of interesting to read while hearing the TV in the background blaring about another settlement reached in Chicago for a group of guys who've been illegally jailed for over 20 years due to police misconduct. Different world.The damaged 'hero', Dave Robicheaux, is a great character who I assume will star in subsequent novels (Neon was the first in a series that now numbers over 20) and other participants in the action, although not as deeply developed, also have staying power. Anytime I 'discover' a novelist I like in a genre I follow with a deep catalog, I'm a happy man. I think I'm happy now...."}, {"userName": "Harry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7597429-harry", "userReview": "I'm new to the legion of James Lee Burke fans (thank you Cathy DuPont). But all that means, is that I still have all these wonderful Robicheaux novels for my reading pleasure, a thought that fills me with distinct satisfaction. For now I'll review the Dave Robicheaux series one by one, until I've gone through the lot and compile a review for all as is my usual habit.I suspect I have an edge as compared to most Burke fans. I have lived in the French Quarter so aptly described in the Burke novels. I've smelled the heat rising from the pavement after a roaring rain, have had my shirt cling to my skin, dripping in sweat upon walking outside, heat surrounding me that I could carve with a steak knife. I've seen the above ground cemetery's, the Spanish moss, the levees, Bourbon street, voodoo parlors , experienced the aura of supernatural practices that bely the belly fat of the city, felt the breeze blowing off Lake Pontcherrain and indeed spent considerable time in Cafe Du Monde, sipping coffee and writing in journals. To this day, I always have a cannister of Cafe Du Monde coffee in my cupboard, it's distinct flavor reminding me of exotic and bohemian New Orleans.What is different about James Lee Burke as a crime writer? In my opinion, Burke has accomplished what few crime writers have. He has bridged the gap between the crime/detective genre and literature. It is, as he says, one of his interests in writing the books. His astute and stylistic handling of prose within what must be said are great detective novels is a pleasure to savor. Only Burke would describe a woman in a wheel chair as having a \"spray of roses in her lap\". Only Burke would look up at his beloved Louisiana sky as it darkens with thunder and be reminded of \"trees of lightning\".In creating the character of Dave Robicheaux, Burke has captured what he considers the essence of the American millieu. It is the anti-hero that fascinates, not the hero, the rich, the poor, or the middle class. And if anything, Dave Robicheaux is a flawed man, an anti-hero with whom we empathize. A man who grows richer even as he battles his flaws. Often I have reviewed books and mentioned flat characters (Flynn comes to mind). Characters who don't seem to grow, who are set in stone and perform plot-like actions, who save the day, and remain set in stone. If you dislike such characterization, than Burke is the man for you.The settings, their descriptions, the imagination of the reader (even if they haven't been to Louisiana) are set afire with Burke's prose. My friend Cathy described this author's prose as causing her to pause just to savor a particular sentence. Here we see the genre transcending itself and moving to literature. These morsels spread across each page are what gives us the pleasure we as readers should expect. There's never too much of it, his style doesn't overpower the plot. Hard to do when you know you're writing great prose. This, over and above the superb plots and magnificent settings that bring it all together.I found it interesting that Burke is a cousin to Andre Dubus II, the short story writer whom I read when much younger. If there ever was an anti-hero, Dubus is one of them. Read his life story, read his short stories. Who influenced Burke the most? Would it surprise you if he said it was James M. Cain, he of \"The Postman Rings Twice\"? Burke fails to understand why Cain is so under rated...which he considers a shame.Assessment: you can put the book down and get some sleep. Not because the book is bad, but because you want to save the rest for later, something to look forward to."}], "description": "Detective Dave Robicheaux has fought too many battles: in Vietnam, with killers and hustlers, with police brass, and with the bottle. Lost without his wife's love, Robicheaux's haunted soul mirrors the intensity and dusky mystery of New Orleans' French Quarter -- the place he calls home, and the place that nearly destroys him when he becomes involved in the case of a young prostitute whose body is found in a bayou. Thrust into the world of drug lords and arms smugglers, Robicheaux must face down a subterranean criminal world and come to terms with his own bruised heart in order to survive.", "title": "The Neon Rain\n      \n          (Dave Robicheaux #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55022.The_Neon_Rain", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386748162l/55022.jpg", "reviews": 913, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7031.James_Lee_Burke", "name": "James Lee Burke"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55022.The_Neon_Rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6137530-the-neon-rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/867097.The_Neon_Rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2035643.The_Neon_Rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161182-the-neon-rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16104859-the-neon-rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8665664-the-neon-rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7954364-the-neon-rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12101857-the-neon-rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55018.The_Tin_Roof_Blowdown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55019.Black_Cherry_Blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7200466-the-glass-rainbow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218736.In_the_Electric_Mist_With_Confederate_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3346854-swan-peak", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
