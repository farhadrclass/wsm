Intanto, dico subito che questi racconti sono tutti bellissimi; due in particolare sono straordinari: quello che d\u00e0 il titolo alla raccolta e l'ultimo, intitolato Eli, il fanatico. Gi\u00e0 nel 1960 dopo aver pubblicato i racconti su riviste prestigiose e averli raccolti in volume, l'esordio letterario viene riconosciuto come altamente rilevante con il conferimento nel National Book Award, elogiato da Saul Bellow, incipit per una carriera arricchita di innumerevoli premi. Roth scende sotto la soglia della percezione, per parlarci di amore e passione, del brivido dei corpi che si incontrano, dell'attrito tra le differenze personali e sociali, di come spesso la tristezza sia dolce e la nostalgia imprevedibile, quando davvero si provano sentimenti autentici. E soprattutto quando si \u00e8 molto giovani: vivi, vivi, vivi, non ti distrarre mai, non rinunciare a nulla, sembra suggerire l'autore. Ecco come ci parla della fine di una relazione: Feci tutto ci\u00f2 che avevo fatto prima, ma ora ogni attivit\u00e0 era come circondata da un recinto, esisteva isolatamente, e la mia vita consisteva nel saltare da un recinto all'altro. Non c'era un filo conduttore, perch\u00e9 Brenda era stata proprio questo\u201d. Poi Roth racconta l'ebraismo, il dissidio tra ragione e fede, tra tradizione e modernit\u00e0, ambientando le storie tra adolescenti, a scuola, nell'esercito, nello sport, nel matrimonio; critica le tensioni individuali e collettive, interroga le angosce comuni. Riesce a essere comico in modo irresistibile, senza privarci di uno sguardo umanista e tragico, anche nell'ironia e nel sarcasmo verso la morale conforme. Racconta di un ragazzo che perde la testa e sale sul tetto di una sinagoga osservando come in un cielo capovolto il rabbino, i compagni e i vigili del fuoco; descrive come un avvocato laico perda la ragione nel contatto con l'ortodossia e il sacro, narra l'infedelt\u00e0 di un inguaribile romantico che spinge il desiderio fino ai limiti fisici e spirituali. Roth \u00e8 artista nello scavare al di sotto delle cose e porre poi su di esse uno sguardo pieno di pathos e pietas insieme. E sempre sorride e si immedesima, senza giudizio, senza falsa ingenuit\u00e0, con lo scarto di esistere e lavorare, nella felicit\u00e0 e nella vergogna, lottando riga dopo riga, frase per frase, immagine per immagine. Ritrae un mondo dove la ricerca del piacere \u00e8 estenuante e i personaggi, indagati dentro e fuori, sono confusi per la perenne incertezza sul futuro. Trattando temi archetipici, Roth descrive un'umanit\u00e0 differente, magari non migliore, ma certamente aperta alla trasformazione e al suo rovesciamento."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Roth is a cosmic anomaly.* He wins Major Award #1 (out of like, a dozen TOTAL)--the National Book Award--for this, his freshman effort, thereby launching his oeuvre, his contributions to the zeitgeist, his Master's talent and CONFIDENCE. But does it deserve it?For the future career of this literary cosmonaut, yes; but as a stand alone debut? Absolutely not!It is a love story of a \"I'm this type of Jew but you are this type of Jew\" variety. Historically significant, yet overrated, overpraised. I suppose. \"Know it exists,\" says me. \"Don't read it.\" (i.e. \"On the Road,\" \"Under the Volcano,\" \"Tropic of Cancer,\" \"Mao II\" et. al.)As for the accompanying stories--well, this is Philip Roth. So although we do get the rotten novella out of the way in the beginning (**), the short stories are very good (****). Earlier Roth is way more playful here than anything that comes later (you hardly ever laugh in any of his dramatic American tragedies); dare I say, picaresque?Two of the stories are even about childhood, which we NEVER really see in his beloved novels. (Kinda reminds me of another premiere writer, Mario Vargas Llosa. His own short story collection at the beginning of his career, \"The Cubs and Other Stories,\" likewise portrays children and childhood--what it is to be green in something one day you will master! What it is to give up forays into shortstoryland for a titanic career as novelist!) Roth's five s.s. are all ambitious, topical, jarring (even funny--this is, again, like soooo rare for Roth*!)--important to the fabric of American history.*hyperbole, maybe"}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248986-evan", "userReview": "\"Curiously, the darkness seemed to have something to do with Harriet, Ron's intended, and I thought for a time that it was simply the reality of Harriet's arrival that had dramatized the passing of time: we had been talking about it and now suddenly it was here \u2014 just as Brenda's departure would be here before we knew it.\" -Goodbye, ColumbusHow often do I think of the passing of time in this way, as Roth describes it in this poignant, wistful and utterly beautiful book. \"Goodbye, Columbus\" already shows a master's hand in his debut. It's not about a love affair or class and social differences so much as it is about the passing of time. The love affair, which is supposed to be so ecstatic, is tinged constantly with the sad realization of its ending. The whole story is pervaded by a sense of inevitability and loss. That the outcome can be nothing but loss. It's as if the loss has already happened.The sense of place, of the arid stasis of dependency, the outsider, the fish out of water...all captured so perfectly.Some will likely fixate, wrongheadedly IMO, on the dated elements (eg., the \"colored boy\", the diaphragm, the parental shock over premarital sex)... So be it.The part that really brought tears to my eyes was when Brenda's brother, Ron, the clueless athlete being seemingly ushered into a marriage to please all parties, listens to a record album of his glory days as a basketball star. Again, the sense of something bygone, the glory days behind one already at such a young age. Now hustled into the banal mandates of social expectation. Ron laying on the bed, drinking in the last of his youth for the last time. This moved me so much. I could hear the record album; Roth describes it so perfectly. Like everything else in the novella, it flies off the page for me.But I initially delved into this svelte volume of early works by first reading one of the five additional short stories, \"Defender of the Faith,\" on recommendation of a young reading pal. As I read it I wondered if this piece was where all the charges of Roth being a \"self-hating Jew\" had begun, and as I read on Wikipedia, it apparently was.So, Roth dares to look at things with more complexity than black and white and eschews neat and childish political boundaries and simplistic feel-good categories. All the more reason to show the man some respect.The story was superb.The man writes like an angel, as a friend once put it.The short stories:Each is splendid in its way. All dealing with Jewish assimilation in post-war (WWII) USA.\"Defender of the Faith\" and \"Eli, the Fanatic\" are the two longest ones, about 40-50pp. each. The latter is an interesting tale with some tinge of magical realism about assimilation vs. tradition; Jews in postwar America not wanting to upset the apple cart in the land that has treated them best of all the places on earth in their long struggle for peace; feeling shame about their orthodox past being out in the open in small-town America. Eli is a lawyer sent by his own assimilated colleagues to send the old-school Jews packing; but he tries to affect a compromise, sensing the injustice and feeling guilty about his own role in the process. The impending birth of his son elicits issues of continuity, tradition and self-identity as a Jew. The idea of a suit, not just as an outer piece of cloth than can be exchanged or replaced, but as an external manifestation of one's inner identity, etc.... Good stuff.\"Epstein,\" another of the longer stories, tells of the mid-life crisis of a hardworking Jewish breadwinner; seemingly disrespected at home and tortured by a sense of life passing him by all around him. The inevitable lure of an affair,...\"You Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings.\" This one, honestly didn't do much for me, but it was fun.\"Conversion of the Jews.\" A cute story about magical revelations stemming from a boy's act of questioning and rebellion. Violence should not be a part of imparting faith on children, etc.In all of the stories, Roth's characters are not heroic, they are human and contradictory. Some people have trouble wrapping their heads around this.All the stories in this book should be read, not just \"Goodbye, Columbus.\""}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6896-peter", "userReview": "If Truman Capote\u2019s Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s is the New York novella about flirting with the city\u2019s upper crust, then Philip Roth\u2019s Goodbye, Columbus is the suburban story for the rest of us.A coming-of-age story about a summer romance, it plumbs tensions from class, generational, religious, and educational differences, and it does so in a way that is instinctive and visceral. While not the most self-aware, sensitive, or rational, the story\u2019s characters\u2014Neil Klugman, a twenty-three year-old man from the poor neighborhoods of Newark, and Brenda Patimkin, the privileged and pretty young woman from Short Hills\u2014are caught in the throes of imminent adulthood, and their flailing pulls Roth\u2019s readers further and further into the personal tensions that drive the story.The result is that Goodbye, Columbus is about as human a novella as I know\u2014human in the character\u2019s confusion about their feelings and human in their often-irrational responses to these feelings.Do I recommend it? Yes. A complex but natural read.Would I teach it? Yes, but it would have to be to the right group.

Aunt Gladys is the Jewish aunt I never had and I want her to nag and fuss over me too.It is a story about loss and longing, the ending of things, bottomless bowls of fruit, the public library, lust, love, and swimming pools. It\u2019s also about fitting in, not fitting in, fear of being trapped, outdated sexual mores, social climbing, and young adult angst. It definitely shows Roth as a skilled young writer.

During the hubbub around the recent awarding of a Man Booker prize to Philip Roth, I was moved to revisit him by reading this novella, published when he was 26. \"Goodbye, Columbus\" was sensitive and fine, complicating my reaction to his prize. I initially sided with Carmen Calil, the Booker judge who abandoned the committee when the two-to-one vote favored Roth. Like Calil, I just can't take a writer seriously if he cannot and will not consider the lives of non-alter-egos. Though I admire some of his work, I question whether he's in the right m\u00e9tier; for example, his awkward disdain for writing about women tarnished \"American Pastoral,\" a novel that should have been an easy A.But not so in this delicate story, which has the feel of \"The Graduate\" and J.D. Salinger: a young man's summer with his girlfriend, her family, and his job at the New York Public Library. Roth writes about a version of himself while displaying generosity towards all kinds of characters: Brenda's father was especially fascinating, but so was Brenda herself and the little boy infatuated with Gauguin.This was the perfect read for a Sunday afternoon. If you have some spare summer moments, pick up this book and reflect on the Roth Question, which was hot last week, upon his acceptance of the prize, and which comes up every time he publishes a creaky Zuckerman novel."}, {"userName": "Scott Rhee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee", "userReview": "The first-ever book by Philip Roth that I read, in college, for a course in Literature & Film, \"Goodbye, Columbus\" is a semi-autobiographical story about young love/lust. The movie version of this novella, by the way, kind of sucks. I fell in love with the book and Roth's prose style immediately. I understand why he has been accused of being misogynistic in his writing, and I don't totally disagree, but I am inclined to say that he strikes me more as someone who is simply being honest about his libido, and he doesn't seem to care if people find him offensive. I found that shocking and extremely titillating as a 20-year-old. I still find it bold and admirable. For a long period (involving most of my 20s and the early years of my 30s), I voraciously read anything and everything Roth wrote. Within the past six or seven years, though, I have basically taken a hiatus from Roth, not because I found his more recent books to be the ramblings of an aging curmudgeon (although that thought had crossed my mind in some of them), but because my literary interests had evolved and my desires in regards to what I look for in a good book have evolved.

The people in the stories themselves aren't significant or even sometimes, likable, but they are moved by someone or something by some small drama of ordinary life and you feel the rawness of that as if it was affecting you personally.There is the stingy boyfriend who refuses to lose to a little girl and forces his girlfriend (who he doesn't even really like that much) to get on birth control and then leaves her. There's also the old man with the saggy breasted wife who gets crotch rot and a heart attack from sleeping around, the elementary school boy with a permanent record he never got over, the lawyer who goes crazy but isn't crazy, and my favorite in the collection -- the 13 year old heretic who jumps off a roof after admonishing his mother, \"You shouldn't hit me about God, Mamma.

It's probably a stronger debut than that other 20th C. American wunderkind Fitzgerald's (younger!) debut book, This Side of Paradise, but I think this book does more for setting expectations about themes and voices for Roth's career than Paradise did for soggy old F. Scott. And if there is a more distilled, earlier version of what came to be known as the stereotypical Jewish-American voice, I have not yet seen it--I've got to imagine that Roth's influence on our culture is extensive."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1798222-shane", "userReview": "Roths\u2019s earlier books are fresh, humorous and vibrant compared to his recent work that is self-obsessed with aging, potency and dying. Goodbye Columbus is just such a vibrant collection that portrays, with humour, the angst of the Jews in New Jersey, transplanted from the recent Holocaust, and trying to find their place in the New World, hindered by a Socialist past, yet striving to become part of the Capitalist ideal. In the title story\u2014a poor-boy-meets-rich-girl (who was once poor but can\u2019t remember it) novella, a coming of age story and a bidding goodbye to the protected world of university days\u2014the innocence of growing up in the \u201850\u2019s comes out. A young couple driving in the Lincoln Tunnel on a secret mission are doing nothing more serious than having a diaphragm fitted, unknown to their parents; whereas contemporary literature would insinuate a more diabolical purpose involving drugs, bombs or homicide. The Jewish family structure is placed under the microscope when the brother of the rich girl is forced to marry and join the family home renovation business in order to earn a living, just because he has knocked up his girlfriend. When the extended family assembles for the wedding party, the dysfunction of an upwardly mobile family is laid bare. Uncle Leo Patimkin is by far the most interesting character, a travelling salesman, who has been left behind in the social climbing and has a lot to say about it, especially after a few bottles of champagne.In the following five shorter pieces, themes of guilt, separatism, survival, assimilation and neuroticism\u2014typical challenges facing the newcomer\u2014play out. In the \u201cConversion of the Jews,\u201d a young Jew exploits his Rabbi and mother\u2019s guilt over being responsible for his impending suicide by getting them to accept that divine births are possible if they believe in an omnipotent God. In \u201cDefender of the Faith,\u201d a Jewish army recruit cloyingly inveigles special privileges from his (also Jewish) sergeant and uses strategic lies to gain advantage. In \u201cEpstein,\u201d we see the classic immigrant who built himself up from scratch, now in middle age, trying to boost his sex life with a bit on the side and falling outside the norms established for his people, with disastrous consequences. \u201cYou Can Tell a Man by the Song He Sings\u201d pits the incumbent ex-con American schoolboy against a brainy Jewish kid, where the moral of the story is that those who have been \u201cin the can\u201d know how to wreak their revenge and yet stay out of trouble compared to those naive ones who play by the rule book. The final story, \u201cEli the Fanatic,\u201d is the most powerful, for it deals with the issue of assimilation and posits the question that it is the responsibility of both the incumbent and the outsider to make inclusion work. Eli\u2019s plunge into neurosis and nervous breakdown signals to us that in 1950\u2019s America this assimilation was still a long way off.For a book released in the 1950\u2019s this collection must have been a rather candid piece of literature, and I\u2019m sure as much as Roth caught America\u2019s attention with it, he must have lost some fans among the Jewish diaspora. The mourning of one\u2019s woes in public, at the expense of patient listeners, the fact that Jewish men at 23 were expected to live at home with their parents, that pre-marital sex even with a diaphragm was considered grounds for family upheaval, and that even the military had to accommodate for Kosher food, must have been uncomfortable skeletons to be aired for upwardly mobile Jews trying to make it in the New World and become part of the mainstream. And yet, these practices may be considered quite normal today, given that: we have public social media to reveal our most intimate gripes, unemployed young people are returning to parental homes in droves, sexual abstinence is making a comeback, and the military is bending over backwards to accommodate diversity in its ranks. I found the typical stylistic flaws of the writer in the early stages of his career; some scenes and situations are difficult to visualize and the narrative is unwieldy in places. Roth\u2019s later work is more polished, but he seems to have acquired that polish at the expense of sacrificing that \u201cin your face\u201d humour that oozes out of Goodbye Columbus, making it an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Fernando", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5399233-fernando", "userReview": "Este es el noveno libro de Roth que me leo.

My first was \"Portnoy's Complaint\", which, in retrospect, was a mistake to read first.Don't get me wrong: \"Portnoy's Complaint\" is a classic, but it's not a masterpiece. \"Goodbye, Columbus\" is absolutely a masterpiece, and I was completely struck by the difference in tone and structure between the two.\"Goodbye, Columbus\", at its heart, is a novella and collection of short stories that address the Jewish Diaspora. When the book premiered, Roth--who is Jewish himself--encountered heavy criticism from perceived self-hating-Jew aspects of the book. Not being Jewish myself, I have no doubt there were countless references I missed, but on the whole, I felt the book was a warm and perhaps honest commentary on Jewish culture from the perspective of a young Jewish man. I would even call it a love letter.What's most startling about Roth's writing here is the authenticity. The dialogue among his characters feels so completely real that there were moments I forgot I was reading fiction. Ranging from the flirtatious exchanges between Neil and Brenda to the absolutely brilliant monologue of Uncle Leo at the wedding, there's an abundance of humor and heart and cringe-inducing familial dynamics to get the blood pumping.However, my favorite part of the entire book was the \"The Conversion of the Jews\" short story about a child who brings his small community to their knees by threatening to jump off a roof. When the story hit its climax, I had tears of laughter pouring from my eyes. It was brilliant.This book has made me want to devour the rest of Roth's work, and if that's not a compliment, I don't know what is."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1792361-rhonda", "userReview": "When I first read Roth's Portnoy's Complaint in college, I confess that I was socially unable to truly understand it. I wasn't Jewish, I didn't grow up in New Yawk and, lastly, I didn't understand why one wouldn't, apparently like most of the University of Miami population, just go elsewhere. Still the title story is by far my favorite of Roth's stories, one which talks about both social insecurities and mistrust. Unlike others, I saw this as a natural outgrowth of the world, but that's another issue.I loved the rebellion of our young protagonist, his sense of being lost but determined to make the best of what was there, essentially educating himself on the more important things in life, especially reading. In that identified perfectly. Even as a post social rebellion teenager, I felt like I might have wanted to be born twenty years previous. Evidently dissent was much easier back then... something which I have since learned is patently untrue.The heavy handed Goodbye Columbus refrain is a salute to a kind of honor in the past without it being in the present. It is an overwhelmingly significant image I took from the book. Clearly most of the characters in the book didn't see any value either but were bound and determined, after flirting with such, to fall into the expected lifestyle of the modern day working drone. Only our hero breaks free and runs. Which one of us has the courage to strike out on his own with nothing? Very Sartrean, but somehow very impressive, especially at the time when I was a college sophomore on her way to knowing everything."}, {"userName": "Grant", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/652004-grant", "userReview": "a book of stories and one novella. the novella is the title piece, \"goodbye, columbus\" and i think the reason i did not give the book 5 stars is that the novella was not as strong as the stories. that said, it is funny. it is good writing. the characters and situation are relateable. but the stories are where roth shines in my opinion. the first two, \"the conversion of the jews\" and \"defender of the faith\" i'd read before, but like any good story, they are both deserving of a second, third, fourth...read. there is the sense in some of the stories that the protagonist might have touched upon some magic, though the plot never really leaves the realm of realism. it gives the those stories an eerieness or cockeyedness. but they all capture a slice from the protagonist's life where his jewish faith, heritage, and culture are at odds with the life he has chosen or that has been chosen for him. which seems to be a theme for roth. a good one i think, since it seems that is something we all struggle with no matter our faith, culture, heritage, or family ties."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "At last, I am no longer a Philip Roth virgin.

I liked the novella for its characters and plot, though he stole shamelessly from Herman Wouk's Marjorie Morningstar. I fell shamelessly into the love story between Neil Klugman, poor New York City Jew, and Brenda Patimkin, New Jersey suburban Jewish American Princess. After all, this is one of the major plots of American literature in the late 20th century and already Roth could write like nobody's business.The short stories ranged from not quite good to deeply weird but they had all been published in mags like \"The Paris Review\" and \"The New Yorker.\" That was the way young, white, male writers gained recognition in those days and clearly Roth got his due.Conclusion: I will continue with Roth's novels and ignore the short stories."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/425884-alexandra", "userReview": "Tenderly rendered.

If those choices seem haphazard, they were: those were the Philip Roth books on the shelf, either those of my ex-wife when we were together, or those I inherited when we separated. Although I enjoyed reading each of them, otherwise I wouldn't have gone back to the well so many times, I have only a vague recollection of their plotlines. I don\u2019t know if that means they were merely pleasant but otherwise lacking in necessary impact, that I wasn\u2019t paying enough attention, that that\u2019s completely normal and I\u2019ve nothing to worry about, or that I should be seriously concerned because my memory has gone to shit. Whatever it means, there\u2019s a reason I now write these reviews, and if I\u2019m the only one who reads this one \u2014 and chances are I will be \u2014 that\u2019s fine by me. Most simply I started writing reviews of every book I read for archival purposes, but my real hope was that, in the process of the writing, each might linger longer in my memory. And, if you, dear reader, take something worthwhile away from any them, then all the better that I was able to put something useful into the world.My choice, then, of 1959\u2019s \u201cGoodbye, Columbus\u201d was deliberate. I wanted to go back to the beginning, to Philip Roth\u2019s first published collection to see where it all began, so that I could rediscover what I enjoyed in his other books, and use that discovery as a springboard into his subsequent bibliography. In short, I was looking for the hook that would turn me from casual Roth enjoyer to eager Roth pursuer. Did it work? It did, succeedingly and endearingly so. Despite the diverse plot lines of the six stories contained within \u2014 the doomed-from-the-start young lovers in \u201cGoodbye, Columbus;\u201d the confrontational student in \u201cThe Conversion of the Jews\u201d who insists on asking unorthodox questions of his rabbi; the army sergeant who refuses to be manipulated in \u201cDefender of the Faith;\u201d \u201cEpstein,\u201d the eponymous character who goes through a midlife crisis and starts an affair with another woman; the high school student who recounts the meeting of, and subsequent events surrounding, a troublemaker in his Occupations class in \u201cYou Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings\u201d (the toss off of the bunch); and the lawyer trying to make peace between assimilated Jews and a newly arrived orthodox yeshiva, as well as within himself, in \u201cEli, the Fanatic,\u201d which is the collection\u2019s apotheosis \u2014 Roth\u2019s perceptive, critical, humorous, and, yes, often unflattering examination of the concerns of American Jews as they deal with faith, class, identity, and assimilation is entirely deserving of its National Book Award for Fiction, and is all the more remarkable because he was only 26 at the time of its publication.If you\u2019ve never read Philip Roth, \u201cGoodbye, Columbus\u201d is as fine a place to discover him as it was for me to rediscover him. And as for my next move? Perhaps it will be his 2004 alternative history novel \u201cThe Plot Against America,\u201d or 1971\u2019s Nixon-inspired political satire \u201cOur Gang,\u201d or maybe I\u2019ll just take him in order (as he may be best enjoyed), with 1962\u2019s \u201cLetting Go.\u201d And for you? To paraphrase the old Jackie DeShannon song, \u201cput a little Roth in your heart.\u201d You won\u2019t regret it."}, {"userName": "Jake Danishevsky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13352775-jake-danishevsky", "userReview": "It is another amazing book by Philip Roth. The book has great story line and characters. When I first discovered this book, it was the first one of the first Philip Roth books that I have purchased on recommendation from my wife. She was actually required to read it in school and then the entire class was evaluating and discussing the story, Goodbye Columbus. She described that the reasons that they were asked to read and discuss it was due to the class distinction between Neil's and Brenda's standing in society and how the two income classes interact with one another, but there is so much more to this story than just that. The ending, which I don't want to give away describes the entire story and leaves a lot to each reader\u2019s own interpretation. [[Start of the Spoiler Alert]] Did Brenda do what she did, by leaving a certain object to be found by her parents to not have to break up with Neil and in the way let the break up happen due to the events that follow? Could Neil blame himself for the events that follow, due to the fact that he was very insistent to demand that Brenda goes and gets the object, hence it is in a way his own doing and his own fault on what has happened? Does Brenda merely forget or could she have avoided the incident and it was just a plain oversight on her end, a mistake, which is most doubtful. There are even comments that are made by several characters that point out how this relationship is bound to fail. For example Neil's aunt commenting on the high society and look at him, Neil, being part of it now. Then Neil's own thoughts on how Brenda's parents will forget about who he is, as soon as Brenda leaves for school and many other examples that drive or display a wedge between Brenda's well to do family and Neil's own current situation and what might or not be his future goals. [[End of the Spoiler]]All and all, it is a great story and well worth the read. Hard to believe that this is Roth's first published work and well deserving every praise and credit. In addition the 5 stories that are part of this book are also amazing, in a way soul searching and even fast paced page turners. Each one is very different from the other, starts out introducing the characters slowly and then takes you on the short journey of incredible characters and events. Enjoyed it very much and enjoyed the main story and the five that followed."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9821636-patrick", "userReview": "Rooney 1Patrick RooneyLTMO 144DProfessor Bruce Thompson7 June 2011Philip Roth\u2019s debut novel, Goodbye, Columbus, is in part a window into secular Jewish life in the fifties era. Twenty-three year-old Neil juggles life and love while tolerating Jewish woes from the immortal (clinging, over-bearing mother figure) to the unique time period, which pits reactionary developments against the first hesitant stirrings of the sexual revolution to come.Goodbye, Columbus follows Neil\u2019s first love affair, a beautiful but vulnerable experience in anyone\u2019s life, as countless melancholy love songs attest to. Cat Steven\u2019s \u201cThe First Cut is the Deepest\u201d may express a sentiment close to universality, but Neil\u2019s experience is all the more complicated for the conflicting cultural pressures of the time. In the age of suburbia, wealthy Jews followed the exodus to picket fences and manicured lawns, abandoning the city life that was so central to first and second-generation Jewish American culture. The resulting divide between wealthy suburban Jews and working-class city Jews fuels the central conflict of the novella. Neil is a college graduate with a modest job at the New York public library who lives with his aunt in Newark. His girlfriend Brenda, however, embodies the new stereotype made possible by the Rooney 2increase of wealth in the Jewish community: that of the Jewish-American Princess.\u201cShe still thinks we live in Newark,\u201d Brenda says disparagingly of her frugal mother, while all Neil\u2019s aunt can say about Brenda\u2019s family is \u201cSince when do Jewish people live in Short Hills? They couldn\u2019t be real Jews believe me\u201d (Roth 26, 58). At first glance this sounds like the Romeo and Juliet formula, but Brenda and Neil are not star-cross\u2019d lovers accidentally entangled in a cultural rivalry, but are themselves partisans, albeit partisans of a confused and lukewarm nature. Neil is painfully aware of his inadequacy as a suitor in the Patimkin\u2019s eyes. Even Brenda questions him tactlessly: \u201cWhy are you still here? Why aren\u2019t you with [your parents]? \u2026\u201cAre you planning on making a career of the library?\u201d (49, 51) His self-consciousness prompts a passive-aggressive attitude toward his lover, certain that she will leave him sooner or later for a boy from the country club.For her part, Brenda is not exactly a snob, but simultaneously resents the expectations of her financially successful family while maintaining a sort of cluelessness about her own privilege, and about Neil\u2019s sensitivity to issues of class. In fact, Neil is sensitive in general. He is wounded, for example, by Mr. Patimkin\u2019s declaration that he eats like a bird, perceiving it as a slight on his masculinity. But it\u2019s hard to blame Brenda too much for her insensitivity, as Neil often hides his feelings Rooney 3under a tough guy fa\u00e7ade. Their romance blossoms in spite of the enormous gulf between their worlds and their difficulty in communicating:\u201cDo you love me, Neil?\u201d\tI did not answer.\t\u201cI\u2019ll sleep with you whether you do or not, so tell me the truth.\u201d\t\u201cThat was pretty crude.\u201d\t\u201cDon\u2019t be prissy,\u201d she said.\t\u201cNo, I mean a crude thing to say about me.\u201d\t\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t, and that she didn\u2019t pained me; I allowed myself the minor subterfuge, however, of forgiving Brenda her obtuseness. \u201cDo you?\u201d she said.\t\u201cNo.\u201d\t\u2026[S]uddenly I was sure that when I left the water Brenda would be gone. I\u2019d be alone in this damn place\u2026.when Brenda finally returned to me I would not let her go, and her cold wetness crept into me somehow and made me shiver. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Brenda. Please, no more games,\u201d I said, and then when I spoke again I held her so tightly I almost dug my body into hers, \u201cI love you,\u201d I said, \u201cI do\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t(51-4).\tAs melodramatically as Aunt Gladys expresses her doubts about suburban Jews, the sentiment reflects a sense of alienation as the old cultural cornerstones fade into irrelevance. Neil reflects upon this \u201cin the heart of the Negro section of Newark.\u201dYears ago, at the time of the great immigration, it had been the Jewish section, and still one could see the little fish stores, the kosher delicatessens, the Turkish baths, where my grandparents had shopped and bathed at the beginning of the century. Even the smells had lingered: whitefish, corned beef, sour tomatoes\u2014but now, on top of these, was the grander greasier smell of auto wrecking shops, the sour stink of a brewery, the burning odor from a leather factory\u201d (90).Rooney 4Smelling is the sense most closely associated with memory, and the mixing of the old and the new represents the past\u2019s semi-permanence as well as the future\u2019s inevitability. Who would come after the Negroes? Who was left? No one, I thought, and someday these streets, where my grandmother drank hot tea from an old jahrzeit glass, would be empty and we would all of us have moved to the crest of the Orange Mountains, and wouldn\u2019t the dead stop kicking at the slats in their coffins then? (91)Neil\u2019s grandparents\u2019 generation of Jewish immigrants were caught between the Old World and the New. Unfortunately, one could say the same for Jews coming of age as Americans in the fifties. They are still torn between loyalty to culture and family and the desire for freedom. They are ambivalent and confused regarding shifting racial hierarchies, in which Jews outrank Blacks, but could not be said to have achieved total equality. They are perched on the fault line dividing the conformist fifties from the revolutionary sixties. It is a difficult time to know how to live, more difficult still to learn how to love.Rooney 5Works CitedRoth, Philip. Goodbye, Columbus.
