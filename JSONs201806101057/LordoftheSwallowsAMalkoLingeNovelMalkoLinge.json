This novel anyway was a little bit too slow, not particularly brilliant and mostly boring because the plot was too linear: no double games and no counterespionage to talk of, so I was sad and disappointed, but it's just because as a constant reader I saw the best of G\u00e9rard de Villiers (R.I.P.) and it's not this novel.Ho letto tanti libri di questo autore, che ritengo secondo soltanto a Ian Fleming nel contesto dei libri di spionaggio; Sua Altezza Serenissima Malko Linge \u00e9 nella mia vita praticamente dall'inizio della mia adolescenza e mi ha sempre fornito parecchie informazioni sulla politica, la storia e il sesso. Questo romanzo tuttavia \u00e9 decisamente troppo lento e non particolarmente brillante, per dirla tutta: noioso perch\u00e9 la trama non prevedeva n\u00e9 doppi giochi n\u00e9 un controspionaggio che sia degno di nota quindi ci sono rimasta male e delusa, ma solo perch\u00e9 come fedele lettore ho gi\u00e1 visto il meglio di G\u00e9rard de Villiers (R.I.P.) e questo libro non ne fa parte.THANKS TO EDELWEISS AND VINTAGE CRIME/BLACK LIZARD FOR THE PREVIEW!"}, {"userName": "Viva", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5639948-viva", "userReview": "The only thing I miss about the Cold War are Cold War spy stories and this one brings it back. Not a historical CW novel but a modern day one of the Brits and CIA against Putin's Russia. This is a Malko Linge book. I'd never read any of this series before but it appears that he is not only an Austrian nobleman but a CIA agent too. This book is only 242 pages long and a quick read. It's got an uncomplicated plot with a satisfying ending. Perfect for a plane ride or something to while away a few hours. Almost like one of those Leslie Charteris Saint books. By the way, this is translated from French and the translation is seamless.Edit: I just read the frontispiece. It appears that the author (now deceased) has written over 200 Malko Linge novels. It's a whole series of escapist and easy to read spy stories! I liked this book and I'll probably try to find and read any of the other translated ones in this series.I got this book as a free review copy."}, {"userName": "Ross", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2856925-ross", "userReview": "Fast paced.
