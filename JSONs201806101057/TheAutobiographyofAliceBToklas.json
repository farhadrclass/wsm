Yes, he said, everybody says that she does not look like it but that does not make any difference, she will, he said.\" Well, I can't really say if Gertrude Stein ever looked like Picasso's portrait of her in real life, but in my imagination, there is no other way to see her, exception made for Man Ray's photograph of her in front of the painting which is a brilliant double portrait of the grand lady through two artist lenses:Whoever is in love with the painters and writers who frequented Paris during the first decades of the 20th century must read Gertrude Stein's brilliant account of the era. A woman of exceptional self-confidence, she conquered a world of machismo and made her own creativity the starting point for a whole generation. Matisse, Hemingway, Picasso, Apollinaire ... The guest list in her novel is exquisite. But it never forgets to pay the most enduring tribute to the hostess of the show - Gertrude Stein herself, as seen through the eyes of her lifelong companion, Alice B. Toklas. It is both a novel and an autobiography, and the careful selection and presentation of specific facts and events turn it into a quasi-fictional construction in the spirit of Goethe's autobiography, appropriately called Dichtung und Wahrheit - or \"fiction and truth\".Gertrude Stein, being a woman, had to face far more severe criticism for believing in her own genius and her right to earn money than any of her male artist friends. Her irony, wit and intelligence speak for themselves, though, and she remains one of the defining voices of her era. The juxtaposition of literary discussions between the masters of the time with seemingly unimportant everyday worries and details is a perfect combination: an overview of a historical phase and an intimate portrait of a woman at the same time.Recommended for Paris lovers and bibliophiles alike - a rare treat!"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "Pablo Picasso! Henri Matisse! Ernest Hemingway! F. Scott Fitzgerald! Sherwood Anderson! T. S. Eliot! Djuna Barnes! Ezra Pound! Georges Braque! Ford Madox Ford! Jean Cocteau!All of these artists and writers were bumping into each other in Paris in the 1920s, often at Gertrude Stein's apartment, the famous salon at 27 rue de Fleurus. (And if you're wondering who the hell Alice B. Toklas is, she was Stein's longtime partner and lover, and calling it an autobiography but yet it was written by Stein was Stein's idea of a joke.) I'll be honest and say I was keen to read this book because I had hoped for some delicious gossip about these famous people, and while there were some good stories, Stein's writing was more difficult to read than I expected. This was my first Stein book, and I would describe her style as a conversational stream of consciousness that frequently turns into babble.Here is a good example of her style: \"This was the year 1907. Gertrude Stein was just seeing through the press Three Lives which she was having privately printed, and she was deep in The Making of Americans, her thousand page book. Picasso had just finished his portrait of her which nobody at that time liked except the painter and the painted and which is now so famous, and he had just begun his strange complicated picture of three women, Matisse had just finished his Bonheur de Vivre, his first big composition which gave him the name of fauve or a zoo. It was the moment Max Jacob has since called the heroic age of cubism. I remember not long ago hearing Picasso and Gertrude Stein talking about various things that had happened at the time, one of them said but all that could not have happened in that one year, oh said the other, my dear you forget we were young then and we did a great deal in a year. There are a great many things to tell of what was happening then and what had happened before, which led up to then, but now I must describe what I saw when I came.\"I did not change anything about that quote -- you get a sense of Stein's run-on sentences and her laissez-faire punctuation. Often when I was reading this book I felt as if I was listening to a confused storyteller, someone who just kept talking and talking and rambling and trying to convey a message, but that they themselves had forgotten what the message was. There were some nice quotes and turns of phrase, such as: \"[Stein] was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, of a very respectable middle class family. She always says that she is very grateful not to have been born of an intellectual family, she has a horror of what she calls intellectual people.\" But I had to slog through quite a few pages before I found a quote worth marking.So, why would someone read this book? Maybe you would be brought to it, as I was, by the Woody Allen movie \"Midnight in Paris,\" which had scenes that were inspired by this memoir. Or maybe you want to hear more about Picasso and Matisse and Hemingway, which were my favorite parts of the book. Maybe you want to read about Paris during World War I, and how empty of men the world had seemed then.For me, I'm still fascinated by the Lost Generation and will read more Hemingway and Fitzgerald (because I didn't fully appreciate them when I was younger), but I may have had my fill of Stein for now."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/512643-michelle", "userReview": "Hold your forefinger and thumb approximately an inch apart. That was how much I knew about Gertrude Stein prior to reading The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. I\u2019m certainly no expert now, not even close, but I can safely say that I am completely enamored of both Stein and her life partner, Toklas. No, it\u2019s not because of the near-constant stream of visiting artists and other members of Parisian society to their home at rue de Fleurus in the early 1900s, though that was impressive. They were very friendly with Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Guillaume Apollinaire. They saw Isadora Duncan dance. They knew Sherwood Anderson, Jean Cocteau, and Ernest Hemingway, which was one of the most humorous relationships in the whole book. They made the acquaintance of T.S. Eliot (he and Stein quarreled over split infinitives -- isn't that great?), Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and late in the book, Paul Bowles. And those are just most of the people I have heard of.No, it\u2019s not because they volunteered for the American Fund for the French Wounded during World War I, though that was noble. They distributed clothing and other goods to soldiers and people that were wounded or displaced by the war. I mostly loved the camaraderie between these two charming women. I loved the idea that Stein wrote the book in the style of an autobiography by Toklas because she became tired of waiting for Toklas to write the book herself. She imitated Toklas\u2019s voice with an almost childlike glee, and I could feel the love on the page."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "During my Modern Poetry class in college, we read some of Tender Buttons (prompting me to write a scathing review of it, which was promptly trolled) and my professor explained Gertrude Stein thus: \"Gertrude Stein believed that there was only one great poet of the twentieth century, and it was her. She might admit that Shakespeare was talented as well, but only on a good day.\" Having now read The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, I fully support this assessment of Miss Stein. Not that I dislike her - in fact, I find Gertrude Stein to be a fascinating person and I like everything I've heard about her. I just. Cannot stand. Her writing. Based on the description, this book should be amazing: Stein, writing as her companion Alice Toklas, describes how they came to live in Paris, World War One, and the various artists and writers who visited their famous salon at 27 Rue de Fleurus. Hemingway is here, as is Picasso, TS Eliot, Max Jacob, Henri Matisse, George Braques, and countless others. A story about all of these people living and working and making art together in Paris in the early 20th century should be incredible, right? Wrong. The main problem is that Alice B. Toklas isn't a very good narrator. Rather than dishing out the dirt on these famous men and women (as Hemingway did in A Moveable Feast), she chooses instead to just rattle off the names of people who visited her and Gertrude Stein, sprinkled with little anecdotes that are either boring despite themselves (according to this book, World War One really wasn't so bad at all, and Toklas spends the most time telling us how hard it was to go on vacation during the war because she had trouble with her passport), or are just plain boring. (\"Glenway left behind him a silk cigarette case with his initials, we kept it until he came back again and then gave it to him.\") Hemingway's snippy gossip may not have been true, but at least it was entertaining. Also there's the fact that Toklas always remains on the fringe of this great group. Stein is right in the middle of it, helping Hemingway with his writing and discussing punctuation with TS Eliot, but Toklas freely admits that she isn't an artist, and always keeps herself apart: \"The genuises came and talked to Gertrude Stein and the wives sat with me. How they unroll, an endless vista through the years. I began with Fernande and then there was Madame Matisse and Marcelle Braque and Josette Gris and Eve Picasso and Bridget Gibb and Marjory Gibb and Hadley and Pauline Hemingway and Mrs. Sherwood Anderson and Mrs. Bravig Imbs and the Mrs. Ford Maddox Ford and endless others, genuises, near geniuses, and might be geniuses, all having wives, and I have sat and talked with them all all the wives and later on, well later on too, I have sat and talked with all.\" For God's sake. It's like if Diane Keaton's character from The Godfather wrote a book about her experiences with the mob. She was there for some of it, and she saw everybody who was important, but then the door slams shut in her face at the end and we realize that she doesn't really know anything at all, and won't ever know."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "643.\tThe Autobiography of Alice B.

Yet when I saw Stein's character in the movie Midnight in Paris, and I read Hemingway's A Moveable Feast, I knew it was time to read the work of one of the few women writers of her time and place. So I started with her autobiography.The title of this memoir,The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, is satire. For years Stein had been asked to write a memoir and she refused. Perhaps this is how she could bring herself to write one: write it as if it were coming from her life partner of over twenty-five years.  Sure, she said, as Pablo once remarked, when you make a thing, it is so complicated making it that it is bound to be ugly, but those that do it after you they don't have to worry about making it and they can make it pretty, and so everybody can like it when the others make it. She was an important figure within American literature--especially once you consider how many writers she mentored and introduced to Parisian society (i.e.: Hemingway) and how many manuscripts she read and edited. She told Fitzgerald (even though he didn't believe in himself at the time) that The Great Gatsby would be read \"when many of his well known contemporaries are forgotten.\" She wrote numerous novels and plays. She also painted and was a vital figure and host within the artistic world. She has a way with sentences in this memoir. Short; concise. I've heard that The Making of Americans has longer sentences but I really liked the stylistic choice here: conversational tone and no dialogue quotations. And it really does sound as if someone is telling you a story (at least in the first part). The first section was my favorite and was an easy four stars for me. I also loved reading about Stein's close relationship with Pablo Picasso. They were best friends and through her you're able to view his lifestyle. Towards the end though, there were too many characters to keep up with and too many mini story lines. You may however, like the inclusion of many writers and artists like: Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson, Sylvia Beach, Roger Fry, Matisse, Cezanne, Picasso, and more. \n She says it is a good thing to have no sense of how it is done in the things that amuse you. You should have one absorbing occupation and as for the other things in life for full enjoyment you should only contemplate results."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "This is timely. There's an article about Gertrude Stein today in the Huffington Post. Others thought she was an asshole (as I describe below) as well. Except I don't think they appreciated the genius part I recognized after reading this book...Here's what I know about Gertrude Stein: She was an asshole.I say that in a joking way. I actually learned more about her from this book than I learned about Alice B. Toklas (whoever she was) because this \"autobiography\" was written by Stein, supposedly from Toklas's perspective and should, for all intents and purposes, be about Toklas. Except it's all about Stein, as though Toklas wrote it about her? You with me so far?If you are, you'll agree Stein was sort of an asshole. But also a genius because who thinks to do all this. It seems overly complicated, right? Just write an autobiography about yourself if you want to write about yourself; it would actually look less arrogant that way. The way she did it was to pretend like it's all about Alice, but that Alice only wrote it about Stein, even though Stein's name is listed as the author... I mean, really. Thinking about this all too much is enough to cause a brain aneurysm.So what did I learn about Alice?:*She did not like hot weather. Or walking. Gertrude Stein, apparently, loved walking and hot weather. Freak.*St. Anthony of Padua was Alice's favorite saint. Gertrude Stein preferred some other guy, some St. Francis of Assissi because animals.*Alice was forgetful. This seems like an especial jab at Alice. Remember, this is Stein writing as though from Alice's perspective, right, so the comment about being forgetful is really Stein calling Alice forgetful. *Alice would go to bed early. Stein was a night owl.Annnd that's about it. In 252 pages, that is all the reader really discovers about Alice B. Toklas. I don't even know what her middle name was. (I lied; her middle name was Babette, but I found that out from looking on Wikipedia. While there is some Alice-related information in the very first chapter, her middle name was not one of the things listed. And people who first pick up the book will inevitably read that first chapter as though it's Stein talking about Stein, because she's the damn author of the book, so it's all very misleading and disorienting at first.)On the other hand, we know so much about Stein, as if there's not enough information about her life out there in the world. What I did learn is that she lived in Pittsburgh for way less amount of time than I ever thought she did. People here love to say \"Gertrude Stein lived in Pittsburgh!\" Sorry, yinzers, she moved away when she was 6 months old and, according to this book, has never stepped foot on Pittsburgh soil again. That is a bummer, I agree. For about a year or more, I lived a block away from the house where she was born. You can see it here: House.Having just re-read Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast recently, it was definitely cool to read Stein's account of the same time and place. They wrote about a lot of the same people, including each other, and it's interesting to see how their views matched or differed. Stein was much more interested in the visual artists of the period than I think Hemingway was (or at least she wrote about it more than he did, being such good friends with some guy called Picasso and others), but still covered a lot of similar territory. In some ways, her description of the early 1900s is more vivid to me reading the account now than Hemingway's was, but I think he was even more interested in exposing gossip than she was (which is hard to believe because she put up a good fight).I'm intrigued that while she talked about the war years in Paris, there's still little emotion behind it, or any real sense how the war caused any significant disturbance in her life. I got the impression that she (or Toklas, or both, or whatever, I give up) wanted to do something good for the cause, but it was mentioned only briefly, and then the topic shifted away from that, returning to more good ol' days with more buddies.I have never been more interested in reading more by Stein. She-Toklas referred to Stein's writing quite a bit, and one day hopefully soon I will tackle The Making of Americans which, I understand, has no real punctuation? Or something like two commas in the entire book? See. Asshole. But, again, also genius. I want to be more pissed at Stein, but I have to admire the way she really seems to be poking fun at the reader.Well played, Stein, well played.Seriously, though, don't read this book if you actually want to know anything about Toklas. You won't find it here, I promise you that."}, {"userName": "Barry Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce", "userReview": "I feel that if I had the chance to meet one person from the 20th Century it would be Gertrude Stein.

The sheer amount of name-dropping in this book is immense; Picasso, Braque, Man Ray, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce, Pound, Beach, et al. Although don't go into this book expecting something along the lines of Hemingway's A Moveable Feast, this majorly focuses on the artists of Paris, not the writers.

I don\u2019t think this work is typical of Stein as she wrote it very quickly with the idea of being commercial as she needed money; not a problem in itself, but it meant she was also ambivalent about it. It is a novel written as though Stein\u2019s partner Alice Toklas is writing an account of Stein\u2019s life in Paris before and after the First World War. It is also an account of those many famous and not so famous writers and artists who passed through their home: Picasso, Matisse, Cezanne, Braque, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, the Sitwells, Appollinaire, Eliot and many others. My issues with Stein relate to her support for Franco in the 1930s. She was also a vocal supporter of Petain, even when he was deporting Jews to Auschwitz. There is a certain political naivety and possibly, being a Jew in Nazi occupied France, some self preservation. There is a point in the novel where Paul Robeson visits Paris. Suffice it to say he received a much warmer welcome from the coalminers of the Welsh Valleys. However Stein was a pioneer in terms of writing about same sex relationships; writing some very early coming out short stories. Stein was also one of the first to use the term gay in her writing. I haven\u2019t read enough Stein to make a judgement about her work and feel I need to read much more. She was an early experimenter with stream of consciousness. Modern critics have tended focus on Stein\u2019s limited breadth; she was politically quite right wing and that is a limiting factor for me. And yet this novel does draw you in. The writing is interesting and managed to offend a fair few of those mentioned (including Hemingway). Jeanette Winterson has argued that this is a development of the type of writing Woolf did in Orlando. This is really an experimental novel. It isn\u2019t clear whether Stein writing as Toklas is expressing the views of Stein or Toklas, or both. Reading it is slightly confusing and you have to think on your feet at times: sometimes it feels as though you are watching Stein as described by Toklas until you remember Stein is writing as Toklas, observing herself. It is also very formally written; Stein is always referred to as Gertrude Stein, never as Gertrude. There is no analysis; it is really a description of domestic manners; dinner parties, buying paintings, moving around France, meeting people etc. I enjoyed the novel. In itself it isn\u2019t ground breaking and I still feel I need a more rounded appreciation of Stein; and I still have some uncertainty about Stein herself. So it\u2019s a bit of a work in progress and I think I will try to look out a decent biography and put The Making of Americans on my tbr list, as well as her short stories."}, {"userName": "Joselito Honestly and Brilliantly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly", "userReview": "I had seen them during my mother's 75th birthday celebrations last January 2011.

They brought with them to the party their three-year-old adopted girl, begot out-of-wedlock by a prostitute in our hometown, father unknown. Years before, they had another adopted girl who died of leukemia before she was a teen.They are my Gertrude Stein (GS) and Alice B. Toklas (ABT). GS and ABT, however, never adopted a child. What they had was a succession of dogs. The last was a white poodle named Basket who outlived GS for many years, went blind and deaf, and died of old age. ABT never got another dog after that.Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein (a play with her \"rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\"). Alice B. Toklas, however, was not dumb bimbo (though she was pretty). She was GS's able collaborator and critic. Well into her 80's she was reading ponderous titles and heavyweight authors and even translating books. She only stopped when her eyes started to fail her (in one of her letters--see my other review today--she said she couldn't read Durrell (Lawrence?) anymore because of her eyes). In this other book I will review today she dismissed Francoise Sagan's \"Bonjour Tristesse\" as an \"abomination\" (I noted this with amusement as I gave this book 2 stars although I missed using this perfect word, \"abomination').Here at goodreads we are all very fond of discussing authors. Hemingway this, Steinbeck that. In \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\" there are also a lot of artists, poets and writers mentioned. The difference is that GS and ABT did not just read them or see their work. They hobnobbed with them in flesh and blood, several of them were even their close friends(or at least they were first name basis with them): Picasso, Matisse, Juan Gris, Thorton Wilder, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Capote, Faulkner, Jean Cocteau, Dos Passos, T.S. Eliot, Steinbeck, H.G. Wells, Ezra Pound, William James, to name a few. These long dead authors/artists will come alive before your eyes (the best, I suppose, to me at least, is the part where GS and ABT met Hemingway, then working for a newspaper, and before he wrote his great novels, GS giving him some pointed advice).This is, however, more than gossips. This was written out of love. Gay love, but love still. GS telling ABT I love you, I know you, I know your story of you, your story of me, and your story of us. But you wouldn't write these stories. Let me then write them for you. This is, then, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas written by her great love, Gertrude Stein.

Picasso, Braque, Matisse and Magritte, Apollinaire, Gide, Pound and Hemingway: all of them and many others attended Stein's celebrated Saturday evening salon. Stein wrote this work in the conversational style of Toklas, who was her life partner. Ostensibly Toklas' autobiography, it is in reality Stein's memoir written as if Stein were Toklas. Whether the voice which emerges is authentically that of Toklas I don't know, but the conversational style is very convincing and comes complete with non sequiturs and digressions. It's an interesting device, but it doesn't make the book - a relatively short one - easy to read. At least, I didn't find it so. If Stein accurately reproduced the rhythm and content of Toklas' conversation, then Toklas was probably best taken in small doses. Writing about herself as if her partner were the one doing the writing allowed Stein to blow her own trumpet more than would have been seemly in a straight memoir. There was nothing shy and retiring about Stein and her high opinion of herself never faltered. Here's what she wrote - in Toklas' voice - at the end of the first chapter:I may say that only three times in my life have I met a genius and each time a bell within me rang and I was not mistaken, and I may say in each case it was before there was any general recognition of the quality of genius in them. The three geniuses of whom I wish to speak are Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso and Alfred Whitehead*. I have met many important people, I have met several great people but I have only known three first class geniuses and in each case on sight within me something rang. In no one of the three cases have I been mistaken.I initially suspected that the not infrequent references in the text to Stein's genius were meant ironically, but I was rapidly persuaded that Stein was serious. She was convinced that her writing had great merit and could not understand why her literary genius went so long unrecoginsed. One of the reasons I wanted to read this book was for Stein's impressions of Ernest Hemingway, who held Stein up to ridicule in A Moveable Feast. They had initially been good friends, but fell out when Hemingway disparaged Sherwood Anderson, whom Stein considered had been a great influence on Hemingway's writing. Reading what Stein had to say about Hemingway in this book - almost all of it extremely unflattering - made me realise that Hemingway's portrait of Stein in A Moveable Feast was effectively his revenge. This is unlikely to be enjoyed by anyone not interested in the writers and artists with whom Stein was acquainted and in that particular period in the history of Paris. Stein, of course, would have wanted the book read for the pleasure of reading the work of a literary genius. Sadly, I think I would prefer to read more about Stein than more of her writing. As it is, this is worth in the region of 3-1/2 stars. *Not being of a mathematical or scientific bent, I'd never heard of Whitehead before. This is what Wikipedia says about him."}, {"userName": "K.D.

Gertrude Stein wrote this book from the perspective of her lover, Alice B. Toklas. It is like an autobiography yet Stein put herself in Toklas' shoes. I am still to read Stein's first novel, Three Lives and her long The Making of the Americans both of which were mentioned a lot of time in this book but I have an inkling that Stein's writing style or voice here is different from what she used in those two books. Her intention was to mimic the speaking style of Toklas: crisp and very conversational. A couple of months back, i.e., prior to reading this book, I saw an old cookbook written by Toklas herself. In the book's intro, she said that one of her fondest dreams was to write her own book. I thought of buying it but when I leafed through the pages, I saw that it had nothing except French food recipes with exotic ingredients that obviously will not be available in a third-world country like the Philippines. So, I did not buy it and now I am regretting it big time. I forewent the chance of having a memento from a fascinating literary non-fiction character. The better half of a self-proclaimed genius: Getrude Stein.Based on this book, it is too early for me to say that Stein is really a genius. The idea of her writing and describing herself as one using Toklas just sounds presumptuous to me. However, as I said it is early for me to say since I am still to read her other works. However in her rented house in Paris before, during and after WWI, she and Toklas hobnobbed with world-renowned artists: painters and writers. These includes the likes of Pablo Picasso (who Stein said to be the other genius), Ernest Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson, T. S. Eliot and many, many others (I will not mention them because I don't know them yet). From reading Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, I am just wondering how come Stein and Toklas did not meet him and his lover, Anais Nin. They could have a foursome date and that would be interesting the drunkard Miller mentioning Stein in his book and genius Stein doing the same to Miller. Aside from being a 1001 book, this is also one of the Top 10 Best Gay & Lesbian Novels in one of the legit surveys I found in the web. However, it has no sex lesbian scenes and if you don't pay close attention to the narration, it might even escape you that Stein and Toklas were lesbian and lovers. My point is that a gay or lesbian novel can be great even if there are no sex scenes. This just reminds me of Augusten Burrough's Running with Scissors that is written nicely like a autobiography but he included disgusting in-your-face homosexual acts that are so distasteful I almost threw the book against the wall.I will surely read Stein's other works and see for myself if she is really a genius.And hey, GR says that this is my 500th read book!

ToklasPeter Sarstedt - Where Do You Go To My Lovely?** (mentions of the Boulevard Saint Michel)It's also a reminder that avant-gardes using simplified, faux-naive writing styles (e.g. Tao Lin and alt-lit) are nothing new. I've said quite a few times this year that I don't enjoy these very basic styles, that I feel some writers under-describe - yet I did rather like the Autobiography. It's not a flat sort of basic, conveying depressed anomie, it's an account of interesting things (time spent with artists and writers; experiences of war work) written conversationally. It was easy enough to read - the sentences were so simple that one can actually apply what Stein says: commas were only a sign that one should pause and take breath but one should know of oneself when one wanted to pause and take breath. (A perverse agreement with the reader who edits in their own head.)For a while I did also miss semi-colons, colons, brackets and dashes - which after all exist to be used, do they not? Yet after a while I stopped adding imagined punctuation. Except for the question marks; too many sentences needed to be read twice for lack of those. And most importantly, the book is quite funny. \"...in the centre of the room stood a huge man glooming. This was Vollard cheerful. When he was really cheerless...\" And as it's more of a non-fiction subject, I didn't have the sense of something missing, because facts are conveyed perfectly well in their context. (It is a context of someone talking about people they know, so there isn't much in the way of biographical background. It's unusual to find a Penguin Modern Classics edition with no introduction or footnotes, but this lacks both. It would have been nice to have some notes, especially for the less well-known figures, without having to look them up online. A more casual alternative in keeping with the narrative tone would be to have a few bunches of pictures - of paintings and people - inserted every now and again as in biographies - with some further info as captions.) And like non-fiction on some subjects, I found it unemotional in a relaxing way (not a failing-to-say-something-about-these-characters way). Something which tallies with Stein's intentions: \"the destruction of associational emotion in poetry and prose\" (p.228), \"exactitude, austerity, absence of variety in light and shade\" (p.57, quote from critic Marcel Brion).The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas is famously not what it says on the tin, being mostly an account of Gertrude Stein's friendships with painters. Whilst I found it all quite interesting, it would be more so to someone who's a fan of cubism and so forth. Whilst it's obviously interesting as a development, unforunately I've always found it ugly, and if I'd been around at the time I would have been a right middlebrow stick-in-the-mud, preferring Art Deco and Nouveau to sideways blue and yellow cyclopes etc. It's very much a gut reaction which has never changed though I have tried: much cubist and surrealist art gives me a feeling of slight background nausea, headache, fear and sometimes annoyance. (Of the Matisse on the cover, all I like is the little line-portrait of the woman in the top left corner: very elegant.) I was quite delighted to hear snippets, though, about Apollinaire, Bertrand Russell, Jean Cocteau, Satie and Scott Fitzgerald. What I most want to know is: what did Alice B. Toklas herself think about this book, later in life? Did she edit and amend it? Did she want to?(I admit to being knackered and to making no effort so far to find out, beyond Wikipedia.)... Your partner, a writer, urges you to write an autobiography. You don't get round to it as soon as they'd like so they do it for you - and, whilst they at least get the voice right, they make most of the book about themselves rather than trying to step into your shoes. Bloody cheek. From a more serious stance, it could be interpreted as quite controlling (I wonder if the reason you don't see this mooted is because both partners were women and readers are less likely to [want to] see it that way.) - but to see it as in some way a bad thing could equally be judgemental and a misunderstanding of the dynamics between the two. (I have been lucky to know a few people I consider to be geniuses or near-geniuses - like Alice I think it's something I can tell as soon as I meet a person - but have far too much ego of my own not to feel that the idea would be, secretly or openly, disgruntling.)This curious project of the Autobiography is part of what makes Stein such a character, a real eccentric with her own unique melange of opinions agreeable and disagreeable, and apparently bulldozer-like confidence/ arrogance. (She even managed to maintain a friendship with Picasso on equal terms which was probably no mean feat; he has always sounded like an absolute arsehole.) When she dropped out of medical school because she was bored, friends pleaded with her to stay because of \"the cause of women\"; her reply was \"you don't know what it is to be bored\". She is criticised because of her exceptionalist / queen bee feminism - obviously I'm likely to agree with her to an extent having grown up in a similar tradition (one which can really be boiled down to intellectual snobbery). What Stein does is demonstrate a sense of freedom that disregards gender; feeling like an exception among one's own gender can be a stepping stone to a wider individualism applied to others: to ways that do not consider gender relevant in plenty of situations and to using gender less as a social categorisation for others - an ideal of equality which at least some strands of feminism have forgotten. The friends' collectivist viewpoint (similar to people who think women have more obligation to vote than do men, because of suffragettes) tries to place extra social burdens and duties on an individual woman to which a man would not be subject. Stein's approach seems to have been very successful for her. By considering herself without question to be worthy of the same respect as any man doing the same work, (and by being a forceful and single-minded individual generally), not feeling that respect was something she had to fight for because of being a woman, (\"just getting on with it and not wasting time on all those meetings\" as I remember hearing a relative put it re. second wave feminism) she achieved it. * Digression. I have not listened to any music at all since March (as in put on any myself - of course I've overheard radios and such) and hardly any since December. One odd consequence of this previously unconscionable musiclessness is that when I do get songs in my head they tend to stay far longer. I find they are either things I heard a lot in 2012 or else much longer ago from university or earlier - with quite a bit of overlap. One track that particularly plagues me for some reason is 'Runaround Sue', which - especially given its monotonous appearance at various times when I was in pain - I started to think of as my own equivalent to 'Brown Girl in the Ring' in Touching the Void. ** I found out last year via Goodreads that plenty of people apparently hate this record.

And it belonged to no country.\nStein suffers for being more interesting as a contextualized person than as a writer, but there are plenty of people who achieved the same without ever having attempted to be an author, so that's hardly a reason for condemnation. The problem, I find, is when regarded within the frame of (an admittedly very compromised version) of feminism, queer theory, Jewishness, and linguistic experimentation, you get a much more fleshed out idea of a woman like her operating in the period she did, with an abandoned medical degree on one side, WWI in the middle, and self publishing as conducted by one's queer partner of 25 years, any of which was a rare story worthy of note in those times. As such, I wouldn't mind a good actual biography of Stein or Toklas, as I feel all the modernist posing sought to distance itself from the reality that drove the generation of such extremes so much as to render itself less holistically interesting as a result, unless one is supremely into ritualistic memorization at the feet of a tiny, largely patriarchal and Eurocentric congregation. I did delight in the brief mentions of Jane Harrison and Mina Loy, and even some of the more insufferably well known male types for the sake of filling in the gaps, but the text, experimental as it was, did its best to normalize everything that was far from normal in those days, and considering how the rest of the 20th century treated Toklas when she outlived her partner, I wouldn't say the pretense was worth it.\nMina Loy equally interested was able to understand without the commas. She has always been able to understand.\nI feel I've ticked off a bucket list book, but as has become customary, the construction of the bucket list is woefully misguided, to say the least. This is especially the case if you look at the rest of Alice B. Toklas' life, as once Stein died Toklas' existence quickly became trapped by the socioeconomic politics of her day, leaving little of the life she lived with such gusto in the pages of Stein's record. I imagine the number of people who read this and went on to get the full story beyond is minute, as who wants to know how the fairy tale ended? People love to cringe at Stein today while they kowtow to others who had a much easier time of doing the things she did and/or attempted to do, but the story is much more impressive and relevant when taken fully into account, but it doesn't make the world look nearly as sympathetic to the experimental outcasts as the ivory tower likes to detail.\nSure, [Stein] said, as Pablo once remarked, when you make a thing, it is so complicated making it that it is bound to be ugly, but those that do it after you they don't have to worry about making it and they can make it pretty, and so everybody can like it when the others make it."}, {"userName": "Phil", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5915778-phil", "userReview": "I did enjoy this book, but not as much as Gertrude Stein probably enjoyed writing it, or thinks that I should like it. And that's my main problem with this book; Stein isn't the epoch-making writer that she believes herself to be. A few things to get straight: i) this isn't an autobiography of Alice B Toklas, ii) this is a sort of autobiography of Gertrude Stein, iii) not a lot happens, iv) most of the people mentioned as geniuses are no longer more than footnotes in art history, v) Stein's writing style isn't designed to engage the reader.Alice B Toklas is most famous nowadays as the name behind hash brownies (from a recipe she included in her \"Alice B Toklas Cook Book\" - a book that she DID write). I still have no idea whether Stein and Toklas were companions or \"companions\" - although I'm sure a quick glance at Wikipedia would tell me.As far as the book goes. It's gossipy, but not in an interesting gossipy way. Stories about other people inevitably wind up being stories about Gertrude Stein (she's like that person who says \"That's enough about me, let's talk about you. What do YOU think about me?\"). The tales before the war are most interesting, if only because the people they were associating with were more famous: Picasso, Matisse, Cezanne, Braque. After the war, the only name of note who appears is Ernest Hemmingway (and Stein takes complete credit for his success and the way he wrote).The war is nothing like the WW1 you might have heard about. Stein and Toklas bimble about in a Ford ambulance and nobody dies and after the war in Paris there are more young people than ever before (which was different from every other city in Europe I should imagine).What's odd is that despite being intensly self-centered and Stein being quite unlikable and the gossip being particularly dull, I quite enjoyed it - although perhaps not in the way that Stein would have liked me to have enjoyed it. I liked it because it felt like a diary that you or I might have written (they said this and I said that and then they said this and then so and so came in etc), and if there was anything that Stein would have hated to have been considered, it would be ordinary."}, {"userName": "Jesse", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1432036-jesse", "userReview": "At first it just seems like simply a gossipy good time, but it also functions as a fascinating mise en abyme (the author speaking about herself through the voice of her partner, etc). It's a thoroughly delightful portal through which to slip into 1920's Paris. I'd wager that Hemingway's A Moveable Feast is generally preferred, but I am definitely Team Stein."}, {"userName": "Miguel Duarte", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5124972-miguel-duarte", "userReview": "http://www.comunidadeculturaearte.com...Paris modernizou, inegavelmente, a arte. Foi na cidade francesa que se formaram muitos dos principais movimentos art\u00edsticos modernos. Come\u00e7ando no s\u00e9culo XIX, com o Impressionismo (ao qual se seguiu o Simbolismo, o P\u00f3s-impressionismo e a Arte Nova), foi o s\u00e9culo XX que veio trazer uma mudan\u00e7a ainda maior na arte, com a chegado do Fauvismo, ao qual se seguiu, por exemplo, o Cubismo e o Surrealismo, ap\u00f3s o famoso manifesto de Breton. Foi nesta Paris que a escritora americana Gertrude Stein se estabeleceu, ao mudar-se para terras francesas em 1903, quando contava vinte e nove anos, marcando a arte, essencialmente, na passagem do P\u00f3s-Impressionismo para os tais movimentos art\u00edsticos que marcaram a arte da primeira metade do s\u00e9culo XX. Como colecionadora de arte, foi uma das grandes respons\u00e1veis, em conjunto com o seu irm\u00e3o Leo Stein, pela aclama\u00e7\u00e3o da arte de vanguarda protagonizada por artistas como Pablo Picasso, Paul C\u00e9zanne e Henri Matisse. Os quadros por si adquiridos eram dispostos na sua casa, em Paris, onde eram exibidos a convidados, e onde Stein passou a organizar um sal\u00e3o juntando, al\u00e9m dos pintores j\u00e1 atr\u00e1s mencionados, tamb\u00e9m poetas e escritores, essencialmente expatriados americanos da qual foi mentora, como Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Ezra Pound e Scott F. Fitzgerald, e n\u00e3o s\u00f3.Naquela que \u00e9, provavelmente, a sua obra de maior renome, A Autobiografia de Alice B. Toklas, de 1933, editada agora em portugu\u00eas pela Ponto de Fuga (que editou tamb\u00e9m, recentemente, O mundo \u00e9 redondo, livro infantil da mesma autora), Stein apresenta-nos uma desconstru\u00e7\u00e3o do conceito de autobiografia, escrevendo um livro atrav\u00e9s do ponto de vista da sua companheira de vida, Alice B. Toklas, e contando a vida de ambas, mas maioritariamente a sua, de Gertrude Stein. A Autobiografia de Alice B. Toklas acaba, portanto, por ser, mais do que um retrato da vida de Toklas, um retrato da vida de Gertrude Stein escrito pela mesma. Imensos s\u00e3o os momentos em que a narradora, ou seja, Alice B. Toklas, se refere a coisas ditas por, ou opini\u00f5es de, Gertrude Stein, explorando esse esbatimento de fronteiras entre a fic\u00e7\u00e3o e a realidade de ser uma mesma pessoa a escrever sobre si pr\u00f3pria na terceira pessoa.Sendo uma das pioneiras do modernismo, e uma clara desconstrutora da linguagem, o estilo da prosa de Gertrude Stein \u00e9 de dif\u00edcil tradu\u00e7\u00e3o e transposi\u00e7\u00e3o para outras l\u00ednguas, e, nesta edi\u00e7\u00e3o da Ponto de Fuga, o tradutor Nuno Quintas f\u00e1-lo habilmente, preservando quer o ritmo quer as peculiaridades da mesma, que est\u00e3o evidenciadas em pleno ao longo da obra. A quase aus\u00eancia de v\u00edrgulas (\u201cas v\u00edrgulas n\u00e3o eram necess\u00e1rias, o sentido deve ser intr\u00ednseco e n\u00e3o ser explicado por v\u00edrgulas e al\u00e9m do mais as v\u00edrgulas eram s\u00f3 um sinal de que se deve pausar e ganhar f\u00f4lego mas devemos ser n\u00f3s a saber quando devemos parar e ganhar f\u00f4lego\u201d) e a repeti\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o duas das caracter\u00edsticas mais evidentes, tendo at\u00e9 levado editores a achar que Gertrude Stein tinha tido uma \u201ceduca\u00e7\u00e3o imperfeita\u201d, como a pr\u00f3pria divulga neste livro, quando fala de uma das suas primeiras edi\u00e7\u00f5es de livros. Ela respondera-lhes que tudo estaria dessa forma de prop\u00f3sito.Ser\u00e1, portanto, ao longo deste caminho percorrido pela prosa de Stein que percorremos a vida destas duas mulheres. Sempre com ponto de partida e ponto de chegada no 29 rue de Fleurus, onde habitavam as duas, passamos por ser\u00f5es em casa de Picasso, de Matisse, por viagens a Espanha, a Inglaterra, pela Primeira Guerra Mundial, que \u00e9 inevitavelmente um acontecimento marcante para toda esta gera\u00e7\u00e3o. As vidas de ambas as mulheres n\u00e3o s\u00e3o pass\u00edveis de serem desligadas das pessoas que as envolveram durante toda a sua vida em Paris, e \u00e9 a\u00ed que reside grande parte do interesse da obra, na cusquice que nos leva pelas hist\u00f3rias privadas das vidas de tantas celebridades quanto Picasso, Matisse, Hemingway, e tantos outros. Por estas mesmas raz\u00f5es, muitos dos visados, aquando da primeira publica\u00e7\u00e3o do livro, mostraram o seu desagrado. O irm\u00e3o de Gertrude, Leo Stein, classifica o livro de \u201cchorrilho de mentiras\u201d, Henri Matisse ofende-se com as descri\u00e7\u00f5es da sua mulher. O livro acabou por ser, no entanto, um sucesso comercial, e um dos grandes respons\u00e1veis pela fama da autora, muito por causa dessas hist\u00f3rias, pol\u00e9micas, sem d\u00favida, que alentam o leitor ao longo das ainda cerca de trezentas p\u00e1ginas do livro. De louvar tamb\u00e9m o cuidado por parte do tradutor de contextualizar, atrav\u00e9s de notas de rodap\u00e9, quem s\u00e3o a maior parte destes nomes citados ao longo da obra, j\u00e1 que, se uns deles s\u00e3o amplamente famosos, outros h\u00e1 que n\u00e3o resistiram \u00e0 passagem do tempo, tendo sido esquecidos nos livros de hist\u00f3ria.N\u00e3o sendo um substituto das diversas biografias oficias ou oficiosas que existir\u00e3o acerca de todos estes nomes, A Autobiografia de Alice B. Toklas, \u00e9, provavelmente, o melhor registo do ambiente e das din\u00e2micas interpessoais em que se vivia nesta Paris da primeira metade do s\u00e9culo XX. D\u00e1-nos, encerrado num estilo \u00fanico como o de Stein, o que se passava nesta cidade que cativou tantos artistas, sem a qual n\u00e3o ter\u00edamos a arte que temos hoje. Melhor que isto, s\u00f3 mesmo indo ao museu ver as obras que sa\u00edram deste cosmos particular."}], "description": "The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas was written in 1933 by Gertrude Stein in the guise of an autobiography authored by Alice B. Toklas, who was her lover. It is a fascinating insight into the art scene in Paris as the couple were friends with Paul C\u00e9zanne, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. They begin the war years in England but return to France, volunteering for the American Fund for the French Wounded, driving around France, helping the wounded and homeless. After the war Gertrude has an argument with T. S. Eliot after he finds one of her writings inappropriate. They become friends with Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway.
