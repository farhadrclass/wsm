I read a lot of holocaust stories because I believe they are so important to read and I enjoy the connections that characters make with their family\u2019s past. Michael \u2018s present story takes place during the Cold War and it became much more of a spy thriller than I had anticipated, a genre I don\u2019t usually read. Thus the 3 stars. There was just too much going on - CIA, KGB, Michael running from place to place - from South Orange , NJ to Munich, then Russia and Paris, California, more characters than I could keep track of. This will more than likely appeal more to those who enjoy the chase. Having said that, there are definitely some things that I liked about the book that kept me reading . The writing flows and I felt a familiarity with things that happened in the 60\u2019s - the Cold War, Kennedy\u2019s assassination, Beatles records. There are some wonderful characters in this book. I couldn\u2019t help but love Michael from the beginning and what Yulie goes through in her young life will break your heart as will Michael\u2019s grandmother Emma\u2019s story. Peter Golden is a well known journalist as well as novelist and it is obvious in the list of Sources he provides, how well researched this book is. In spite of the fact that this turned out to be more spy thriller than I had anticipated, I would recommend it those who enjoy the genre. I\u2019m glad I stuck with it because it is also a good piece of historical fiction which depicts the suffering, courage and love of characters who represent people who may have lived through these times. I received an advanced copy of this book from Atria through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "T.H.

At times, the book is a thriller, others a mystery, and still others, a romance, but at all times, it's captivating, emotional, and incredibly well told. The story opens in Michael's childhood and reads like a memoir until his grandmother is killed, and then it takes off like a thriller wrapped in a mystery as Michael tries to figure out who killed his grandmother and why. His search for the truth takes him to Europe and Russia where he meets and falls for Yuli, a smuggler and defacto spy. Together they seek clues about the death of Emma, which only raises more questions and puts them both in danger.PlotImpeccably\u00a0 researched, there is as much history as there is storytelling going on between the pages. The story is expertly plotted and moves along at a steady rate. The pace picks up speed at the climax and keeps it up until the very end. And that ending...wow. For me, it's perfect. Yes, I want to know what happens next, but I don't need to know. It's such a satisfying conclusion with just the right amount of uncertainty to allow me to imagine what comes after without feeling frustrated.The CharactersThe characters are a masterpiece. Michael, Yuli, Der Schmuggler...they're deep, nuanced, and intriguing. Throughout the story, Emma goes from being an enigma to someone fully fleshed out as the reader learns through Micheal's research who Emma really was. The characters seem so much a part of the era (late 1950s to 1960s), that I never once questioned the setting.Top Five Things I Loved\u00a0About\u00a0NOTHING IS FORGOTTEN1. Yuli. She was by far my favorite character. She's so complex, strong and vulnerable, proud with fits of guilt, having lived through the horrors of the second World War, she's hard to identify with, but so easy to root for.2. Michael. His optimistic Americanism is the polar opposite of Yuli's Eastern European post-war hopelessness. His quest to uncover the truth is both reckless and admirable, making him an absolutely fascinating protagonist.3. History. I love history, but even more when it serves as a backdrop to a compelling story. The author's meticulous attention to detail made history come alive, leaving me wanting to learn more about the events of that time.4. The ending. One of the best endings ever.5. Storytelling. The way the story unfolds kept me glued to the pages, but the characters made me care about what happened.Bottom LineOne of my all-time favorite novels. I will be reading more by Peter Golden.DisclaimerI was provided a copy of this book by the publisher\u00a0in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Keren Krinick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15848813-keren-krinick", "userReview": "Wow, I didn't expect this novel to be so powerful! \"Nothing Is Forgotten\", by Peter Golden, is an interesting historical fiction, spanning from the 1960's in America, to WWII in Eastern Europe, as well as the Cold War in Russia and East Berlin. A young man's exploration of his family roots, told with the rhythm of a mystery novel. Full of thorough research and vivid descriptions, with many unexpected turn of events and discoveries. A proof that our stories, indeed, do not have to be \"written in invisible ink\". I highly recommend it!

The writing style is wonderful and does a terrific job in unfolding the story, so that the reader is compelled to keep reading - never feeling like the story has revealed itself prematurely. In my own work as a genealogist, I know how challenging it can be to tell ancestral stories in a compelling way that is accurate in terms of social, economic, and political context. This book does just that. It is clear that extensive research was done which contributes so much to the depth of the story but that research is wrapped around vivid characters, with well developed individual story lines that intertwine. In this novel, one of the lessons that Emma Dainov imparts to her grandson, Michael, is that \"you fix the past in the present, not in the past.\" Michael discovers there is much more to Emma's past than he ever knew or imagined and, after her death, he embarks on a journey to search for answers which unfolds a story of the Holocaust and a resulting life-encompassing quest of Emma's that Michael will attempt to bring to fruition.A great story that I highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "Rita Dragonette", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74433049-rita-dragonette", "userReview": "Golden\u2019s Nothing is Forgotten features a central metaphor of Russian nesting dolls to drive deeper and deeper to reveal a story that keeps surprising the reader with all that it is-- a baffling murder mystery, a riveting historical novel, an espionage thriller with a dizzying cast of characters, a tragic family saga and, to top it off, a love story. This smorgasbord of interrelated plot points will certainly propel you through the pages, but as the novel crosses genres it also unfolds as a story of surprising charm and affection. I\u2019m amazed at Golden\u2019s skill in using love stories featuring open-hearted men entranced with complex women to ground his fresh takes on war-based stories we think we know-- from the Vietnam of Comeback Love to the World War II of Wherever There is Light and now the dual Cold War and Holocaust setting of Nothing is Forgotten.

Michael Daniels is raised by his grandmother after his parents are killed in a car accident. When his grandmother passes away, Michael learns that she had many secrets. The story goes from New Jersey to Russia to France as Michael tries to uncover the secrets of the woman he thought he knew, and tries to understand why she kept so many important details of her life from him.I enjoyed the aspects of mystery that the story took on as Michael was led from place to place in search of answers. I enjoyed how Michael would not give up and was intent on learning the truth. I enjoyed the blossoming romance between Michael and Yuli.

I wasn't sure I could take another WWII book, however that Nothing Is Forgotten is based on Russia's part in the war is an intriguingly new take. The perspectives going back and forth between characters makes the storyline and dialogue more interesting and lets the book flow. Misha (Michael) and Yuli's love story takes us from New Jersey to Russia, East Germany and all over France while the two learn about each other and Misha's family heritage. The characters are well written and believable, I was even rooting for the two of them to get together already.

Not only does the show become a local hit because of his running satires of USSR leader Nikita Khrushchev, but half a world away, it picks up listeners in a small Soviet city. There, with rock and roll leaking in through bootlegged airwaves, Yulianna Kosoy\u2014a war orphan in her mid-twenties\u2014is sneaking American goods into the country with her boss, Der Schmuggler.But just as Michael\u2019s radio show is taking off, his grandmother is murdered in the candy store. Why anyone would commit such an atrocity against such a warm, affable woman is anyone\u2019s guess. But she had always been secretive about her past and, as Michael discovers, guarded a shadowy ancestral history. In order to solve the mystery of who killed her, Michael sets out to Europe to learn where he\u2014and his grandmother\u2014really came from.Featuring Peter Golden\u2019s signature \u201cvivid characters and strong storytelling\u201d (The Washington Post), Nothing Is Forgotten changes our understanding of the impact of World War II on its survivors and their descendants, and will appeal to fans of novels by Anita Diamant and Kristin Hannah.", "title": "Nothing Is Forgotten", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297462-nothing-is-forgotten", "average": 4.37, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519625933l/35297462.jpg", "reviews": 36, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/387285.Peter_Golden", "name": "Peter Golden"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Mystery", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297462-nothing-is-forgotten", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38526755-nothing-is-forgotten", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25111147-wherever-there-is-light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633983-comeback-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14734404-o-powerful-western-star", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18066873-the-world-of-the-khazars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27096338-the-voice-of-ireland"]}
