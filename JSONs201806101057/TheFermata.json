It gets panned all the time for two things:THE FIRST CHARGENicholson Baker has godlike powers over the English language, particularly when it comes to Jamesian sentence structure and the maximum ramifying of vocabulary and the application of all this to most unlikely subjects, as for instance straws (the ones through which drinks are ingested not the ones in the wind) or shoelaces and here in The Fermata he squanders his great gifts on this heaping morass of schoolboy peeping-under-girls'-skirts prurience (and taking them right off) and sniggering lipsmacking giggling drooling stickyfingered lasciviousness.THE SECOND CHARGEIn The Fermata his hero learns how to STOP TIME and then be able to walk around inside the stopped moment, stepping around the now-frozen puddle splashes, gently moving dogs out of the way, and so forth, and with this great galactic mindblowing power what does this guy do? Does he rewrite history? No, he undresses girls and goes into ladies bathrooms and ogles ogles ogles. And other things which you'll have to read the book to discover but I'll bet your mind is already right there. So this guy is - yes - completely frittering away his great powers -ah, wait - BING!!! Just like Nicholson Baker himself - ergo -this is a self-referential comedy which brilliantly parodies the author's own inabilities to find something grown-up to do with his obvious talents. It's the perfect metaphor. Some guys live for the perfect wave, and for some of us less good-looking types it's the perfect metaphor. As The Beach Boys sang, \"Catch a metaphor and you're sittin' on top of the world\". Four very squelchy stars wrapped in kleenex and placed carefully at the bottom of the bin and covered up with other less naughty rubbish for you, Master Baker."}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "The Douchiest Conversation I Have Ever Overheard, Or: An Over-Intellectual Hipster Talks About Sex in Such a Pretentious Way that You Suspect He Perhaps Does Not Have It All That Often - A Play in One ActSETTING: STAIRS leading down to SUBWAY PLATFORM on Jackson Street, Chicago, Ill.

It assumes, quite rightly, that everyone would undress and violate their fellow citizens within about four seconds, so asks instead how would you use this erotic licence to engineer love in the moving world? Such is the problem of our hapless obsessive narrator who, like the hero in The Mezzanine, observes a pathological attention-to-detail to the minutiae of his warped inventions. Since constructing his time-stopping device through a series of implausible homemade contraptions, he has practiced a strict moral code: no stealing and no sexual deviation observable to his victims in the moving world. A laudable practice that he doesn\u2019t always observe, especially with those he has reciprocal sex with.Sadly, I came to identify with the narrator at points\u2014not in his planting-porno-on-the-beach or his whipping-himself-into masturbatory-frenzies side\u2014but in his attempts to manipulate fate while remaining invisible to the victims of his infatuation. In my case, I became infatuated with a woman in a blue-button hat who caught the 8am train into Edinburgh. After some harmless staring I detected her reading Treasure Island and tried dropping feeble hints that I too was reader, and that although we only shared a train trip and interest in books, we one day might unite in supernovas of love and set the universe on fire. Or, failing that, do it quick and nasty in the driver\u2019s cabin. My technique was to carry a book underarm at all times, as though the book might magnetise her toward me. Feeble.This novel is awesome. Exemplary verbal gymnastics, hilarious neologisms (or neolojisms) and crazy Flann O\u2019Brien-style humour. And lashes of gratuitous pornographic content.

I have mixed feelings regarding this novel. My favorite thing was all the observant details, something I have come to expect from Nicholson Baker. My favorite of his is The Mezzanine, which takes place during the protagonist's lunch, the quintessential book about \"nothing\" ( by this I mean a book that seems to have no straightforward plot, yet manages to discuss and philosophizes on very relevant things). For example, Baker writes beautifully regarding his preference for glasses over contacts. It is these parts of the text; Baker's ability to create beauty from the banal and ordinary, that enamors me of his writing, despite other things I may not like about it.  I liked holding one of them in an aqueous bread on the tip of my finger and admiring it's Saarinenesque upcurve, and when I fold it in half and rub its surface against itself to break up the protein deposits, I often remembered the satisfaction of making almost a Teflon fry pans. But though as a hobby they were rewarding, though I was as excited in opening the centrifugal spin cleaning machine I ordered for them as I would have been if I had bought an automatic bread Baker or a new kind of sexual utensil, they interfered with my appreciation of the world. I could see things to them, but I was not pleased to look at things. The bandwidth of my optical processors was being flooded with \"there is an intruder on your eyeball\" messages, so that a lot was simply not able to get through... At first, I thought it was worth losing the beauty of the world in order to look better to the world. I really was more handsome without glasses... The deciding moment really came when I spent the night with a woman who I think had sex with me sooner than she wanted to simply to distract me from noticing the fact that her contacts were bothering her. She hurried to the sex because the extreme intimacy, to her way of thinking, of appearing before me in her glasses was only possible after the last extreme intimacy of fucking me... I recognized The crucial importance of hinges to my pleasure in life. When I open my glasses in the morning before taking a shower and going to work, I am like an excited tourist who has risen from a hotel bed on the first day of a vacation: I have blown open a set of double French doors leading out onto a sunlit balcony with a view of the entire whatever- shipping corridor, bay, valley, parking lot. (How can people not like views over motel parking lots in the early morning? The new subtler car colors, the blue greens and warmer greys, and the sense that all those individuals are leveled in the democracy of sleep... make for one of the more inspiring visions that life can offer before nine o'clock.)  \"The Fermata\", of course, does have a more substantial plot than \"The Mezzanine\". Quite an interesting one. Now, what is a Fermata? It is a music symbol, a notation indicating that the note should be prolonged beyond its normal duration. How does that relate to our story? (The full explanation with a l back story involving ex-girlfriend Rhody's infatuation with her music teacher begins on page 160) The narrator of our story, Arnold, for whatever reason, has been gifted the power to \"pause\" time. Think Adam Sandler in \"Click\". During this time, he can float and meander around the world however he pleases. He describes the rest of the world as being in gel-like suspension.  \"The Fermata\" is the name our protagonist has given this memoir we are reading, which he has been writing during \"paused time\". For the past year, he has been spending one day on real time to every 24 hours where the rest of the world is paused and he can do whatever wants. During this time away from time, he ages twice as fast, of course, but the draw of The Fermata (also known as The Fold, among a number of other words he has created, the lingo of his time pausing) outweighs any side effects of his time manipulation. In all, he has spent an estimated two years in The Fermata, making him 37 years old, though on paper he is only 35. Now, what would you do if you had these powers? Murders, robberies, vigilante fun, good Samaritan deeds, revenge? All these would come to mind immediately. I found some of the ideas suggested by other characters quite creative. (Hypothetically, of course, for Strine does not actually tell but one person what he in his free time.) Rhody, his ex girlfriend, has this idea to pause time and stick a post-it note inconspicuously on her bosses' back everyone he says one of his annoying catchphrases. In this way, she would feel better about her day, but he might not even notice. Genius. Our protagonist wants none of this. He wants, instead, to fulfill his sexual fantasies. But in a very specific way. He is a voyuer of the highest class. His most favorite entertainment The Fermata is to undress women. Carefully, though. He has morals, you see. He would never fluster anyone, would not want anyone to be confused once he restarted time. He tells us that fear is his least favorite emotion; he wants to be responsible for creating as little of it as possible. He documents exactly how they are before he paused time so that he can put things back exactly the way they were. When he needs anything, he leaves cash and a note (As if this will not serve to scare anyone; it is interesting how his \"morals\" apply specifically to women and his sexual exploits.) \"I am less suave with a woman when I have not had a preview of her breasts\", he tells readers. This is all we need to know to understand how enabled Strine has become, how much of a slave he is to the abilities he has to violate the privacy of women everywhere. The mention of the hypothetical situation of The Fermata and what he would do with those powers to his ex girlfriend Rhody is what ended their relationship. Then again, he probably never would have been with her in the first place were it not for his powers. He first \"seduced\" her during septate Thai dinners, by pausing time, finding out what she was reading, seeing her handwritten note that she thought guys removing their watches was erotic, and acting accordingly. Yes, of course he used his powers to run into her at the right bookstore section, and very slowly would remove his watch, teasingly. Likewise, his next significant relationship, with Joyce, began only because he found confidence by undressing her first. How sad to know your significant relationships, even the most significant ones, began under this guise. To further entertain himself, he mixes it up. Sometimes he merely removes the bra and plays with it, other times he undress then completely. His endeavors become more and more elaborate, maybe ingenious; although impressive, one wishes he would use this intelligence and originality for more positive and utilitarian exploits. Some of my favorite shenanigans: 1. \"Moving Psi Squares\"; with time paused, he arranges tiny one-inch squares cut from: 1. Pink and black construction paper, 2. Noteworthy faces from fashion magazines, & 3. A flyer from a distributor of porn films, in front of a woman in the Boston Library. He turns time \"on\" for a fraction of a second, randomizes the squares again. Repeat several times. Very tedious, yes, but I find the psychology here fascinating, for of course it subtly arouses her, but the fractions of time are so minute that she has no idea why. 2. He writes a couple erotica novellas/stories that he plants near a woman in order to watch her reaction as she reads erotic fiction that he wrote. Of course, when he sees her becoming aroused, he follows her home to watch her masturbate. As a side note, this was the part of the book where it becomes straight pornography, these books within the book. The erotic fiction Strine wrote centered around Marian, a divorced middle aged woman whom resorts to ordering a panoply of dildos. She uses these first alone; then with the UPS Delivery Man in his truck, having him navigate the roads purposefully roughly to accentuate her masturbation; then with the teenage boy she hired to help with her gardening and his outspoken girlfriend. In this latter situation, she is out in her yard, a huge dildo inserted- not in her vagina but the reverse- when they come to visit. She is highly aroused by telling them all about it, and they end up having an intense threesome. 3. Strine says he rarely watches others having sex, but admits to doing so when Rhody leaves him for another man. He goes so far as to violate his personal code by pausing time, inserting his penis into Rhody where the other man's previously was. When he puts things back and restarts time, the man is of course flaccid, and very confused, not to mention offending Rhody. 4. The only time he does pure bad: After he is mugged, he ties several guys' penises together and onto a pole. One second there are getting away with his wallet, the next they find themselves publicly exposed and in pain. During \"regular time\", Strine is a temporary employee at a Boston Bank. He works as a rather mundane typist. He admits to us that he is working below his qualifications, but with his inability to stay away from The Fermata, his time a energies so focused on his next sexual adventure, he could not care less what he does in real time. Like all addictions, his life would become suddenly empty without it. He sees this whenever his powers temporarily disappear. Throughout the years, he has had to find different ways to \"engage\" The Fermata, including a transformer (the original method used, in the fourth grade, used to undress his fourth grade teacher and to draw on her with blue chalk), a pen, lifting his glasses, a playing of piano keys. Joyce, a co-worker of his is the first person Strine confides in, and although at first understandably upset when she finds out he had already undressed her and investigated her apartment without her knowledge, she not only accepts but fully embraces his powers. Strine comes up with the idea to \"trick\" The Fermata by engaging his switch (his glasses at this point in time) while they are having sex, his penis deep inside of her, convincing the powers that be that they are the same person. It works. Then, he inadvertently transfers all his fermational powers to her. Apparently, it was transferred through the use of his Penis Vaccuum & Goddess Athena vibrator. He feels assured that his powers will eventually return to him, but it is a nice ending in that we see he is functioning alright with real life love versus the guise of what he had been doing for years in The Fermata. She, of course, is having her share of the fun and novelty of it. I could do without some of the overtly sexual things (I am personally not an erotica reader), but loved the idea of the novel, Baker's ability to create beauty from the ordinary, and the originality of his concepts, abstract yet always making readers think, long after the last page is turned.  I do not think that loneliness is necessarily a bad condition. I like the heroes or heroines of books I read to be living alone, and feeling lonely, because reading is itself a state of artificially enhanced loneliness. Loneliness makes you consider other people's lives, makes you more polite to those you deal with a passing, dampens irony and cynicism."}, {"userName": "Sarah Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59032-sarah-smith", "userReview": "This book is so smutty that I should have thought better of reading it at work on a slow day. Some passages \u2013 especially those in which Arno, the protagonist, freezes time so he can write a dirty story tailored to one momentary subject of his infatuation or another and hide it within reach so that she will find it when he unfreezes time \u2013 test the limits of what one could consider public reading material. The rest of the book considers Arno's unusual abilities from a charmed philosophical distance, but there's no doubt that when this book gets dirty it gets real durty. Like many of Baker's other novels, \"The Fermata\" makes use of an unconventional narrative pace, but what could read as foppish or annoyingly smarmy is instead character-driven, and better yet, driven by a very intelligent, observant character. I guess that's the source of the charm, which is why I consider the outr\u00e9 turns \"smutty\" rather than \"filthy\" \u2013 because really, smut is a non-threatening grade of human vagary motivated by humility rather than gonzo boners (or at least it seems so to me). I know others have voiced concerns about the book's lackadaisical morals regarding undressing and examining women who are frozen in time, and if my grad school punch-card hasn't already been revoked, saying that I find those moral quandaries to be ultimately less than crucial here would certainly do the trick. Still, I think the problem most germane to this kind of story isn't what a man does with the power to stop time but how he rationalizes its presence in his life. Arno is a terminal temp, living comfortably but without the garnishes we usually expect to accompany a nearly middle-aged life, but more crucially, he is alienated by the skill he can't share and the attitudes it grants him. Though these particular details are fantastical, in practice they really aren't so different from how so many of us (or myself, anyway) approach adulthood.And yet, and yet. Such an elegant metaphor could turn nihilistic. The story takes a fairly conventional romantic narrative arc in its last act, one that's reaffirming but not wholly convincing. I found it a little rushed and dissatisfying, but I was still glad Baker didn't turn this effervescent novel into a time-altering update of \"The Trial.\""}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/282195-nicole", "userReview": "This is the super juiciest book I've ever read.

The New York Times, for example, calls it a \u201cglorious filthfest,\u201d and \"as funny as it is filthy.\"As someone with an interest both in erotica/pornography (I write the stuff) and works of high literary aspiration (um, I read the stuff), I naturally felt I had to check this dude out.I tried the Kindle sample-snippet of \"House of Holes\" first, but it didn't really grab me. It felt too easy, too facile and light-weight. As I read, a voice in the back of my head was muttering \"yeah, yeah, some whacky surrealism, some explicit sex, more whacky surrealism, rinse and repeat. Ho-hum.\" Like the philistine looking at a Jackson Pollock, I kept thinking, \"Whatsa big deal? *I* could do this.\"Whether or not that leapt-to assessment of \"House of Holes\" was fair, I decided to try out \"The Fermata,\" an earlier book of Baker's. The major draw of this novel for me was the delightfully sexy premise: A man has the ability to stop time, and uses his power to undress and ogle women. Yes, it's an old idea, but I thought it was potentially a terrific jumping-off point.I was not disappointed. The main charm of the book is in the character of the protagonist. He's an immensely gentle, thoughtful man who takes great pains to avoid doing any harm or causing any distress with his magical power. The women he undresses, he meticulously re-dresses before restarting time, careful to leave behind no trace of his trespasses on their bodies. Furthermore, he's no mere seeker after nubile perfection. Instead he takes a boundless delight in the variations of women's bodies; \"the average woman, the unexceptionable woman, the interestingly ugly woman\u2026\" In his delight, he waxes poetic for pages at a time over one woman's pubic hair (\"to think I could have died and not seen this\u2026\"), the breasts of a host of others (\"perfect in their indispensable imperfection\"), and even such minutia as \"the beautifully defined H shapes\" at the backs of another woman's knees. He is intoxicated, transported and inspired by the physical beauty he unveils, by the secrets that women's uncovered bodies whisper to him.Baker has said that he's a great admirer of John Updike, and it shows. The narrative is often intermixed with Updike-like musings on such peripheral topics as contact lenses versus eyeglasses or the experience of transcribing dictaphone tapes. But always (even more so than in Updike), these meditations are inspired and filtered through the protagonist's all-pervasive sexuality.Speaking of sex\u2026 Yes, there's rather a lot of it. But since this is \"literary pornography\" (a term that in combination with Nicholson Baker's name returns 206 hits on Google), it's not the wall-to-wall sex you'll find in straightforward porn [cough[like mine]cough]. But the hot parts are definitely hot, and cover a generous range of kinks and variations.Something of a standard line of description in reviews of erotica is \"but there's a good story too.\" I'm spared from having to parrot that apologetic-sounding phrase here, because really there is no \"story\" to \"The Fermata.\" There's no plot arc or character arc to speak of. Rather, it's more of a portrait -- a deftly and artistically rendered portrait of a delightful character and his magical gift."}, {"userName": "Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/239699-pierce", "userReview": "Mr. Morrison recommended I check this out after reading that \"Killing Time\" thing I wrote. And yeah, it's kind of exactly the same idea stretched to the length of a novel. Namely, what would you do if you could actually stop time (answer: take people's clothes off).Except whereas I thought it would be funnier to just hint at the idea, Baker seemed to think it was funnier to go into pages and pages of graphic detail about the whole process. Maybe that is funnier, I dunno. So it was interesting for the first two chapters, because we both came to similar conclusions about what being the only thing moving through time would be like, eventually I got sick of it because you can only read so many accounts of a guy masturbating on people and then congratulating himself on his ethical behaviour.I guess this book kind of called my bluff.p.s.

It's comprised of equal parts literature, science-fiction, romance, comedy, erotica, and memoir.On the one hand, it absolutely deserves an five-star review for its sheer audacity, innovation, and mastery of language. This is a very clever, beautifully written novel that manages to deliberately meander without boring the reader. It's also a very humorous novel, not so much in a laugh-out-loud sort of way, but one which succeeds in delivering a smile (or more often a smirk) per page. When I allowed myself to become lost in Arno's voice, I quite enjoyed the read, even as I rolled my eyes and scoffed at his good-natured laziness. It's no wonder Baker gets far more attention as a purveyor of literature than as a genre author, but you get the sense that's entirely how he likes it.Having said all that, this is a book that struggles to earn more than a single-star review for its plotting, pacing, and story-telling. It's is a story comprised of musings, observations, and asides, in which very little happens to advance the plot. Being a fictional memoir does excuse the narrative struggle to some extent, but the 'fictional' element does demand something more. There's a great concept at the heart of the story, with Arno able to freeze time and manipulate those around him, but his own odd sense of morality and decorum won't allow him to exploit it, while his own laziness holds him back from maximizing it. Of course, Arno and his failings are, essentially, the story, so it's hard to find him at fault. Still, it's a read that frustrated me to no extent because it adamantly refused to explore the concept.Basically, the book comes down to this - Arno longs for women he can never have; freezes time in order to undress or gently molest them; and then restarts time and walks away without the possibility of emotional attachment. It's an interesting concept, and one that's definitely erotic in its application, yet which manages to avoid being obscene in its own cleverness. Arno is so disarming, his efforts come across as innocent and rather naive, good-natured in their thoughtfulness, when in reality they're rather personal assaults upon the women around him.There's one chapter where he continually stops and starts time, adjusting pornographic images for one woman and adjusting a discreetly place sex-toy for another, which kind of sums up the entire novel. It's weirdly inventive and amusing, but the work required to secretly arouse the two women - with absolutely no payoff for Arno - is so far beyond absurd, it really strains the bounds of credibility.If you're a fan of literate novels, one who favours concept over content, and one who appreciates narration over narrative, give The Fermata a shot. It is a fun read (taken in small doses) but the novelty does wear thin after a while. On the other hand, if you're at all intrigued by the concept, but (like myself) tend to lean more towards plot and characterization that storytelling showmanship, try giving Dean Koontz's Dragon Tears a read instead.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins"}, {"userName": "Jason Pettus", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus", "userReview": "one of two books from the early 1990s to make nicholson baker a household name (the other being the even bigger-selling vox), this novel tells the tale of a dysfunctional intellectual who figures out how to stop time...then uses the ability to keep his life in a perpetual stage of suspended adolescence, as well as commenting a lot about the world at large. like the rest of his work, the fermata is a polarizing piece of fiction, one you're guaranteed to either love or hate."}, {"userName": "Allycks", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/192703-allycks", "userReview": "The basic idea here is awesome. Protagonist finds a way to stop time, and is able, during the time-stops, to move around and do as he pleases as the rest of the world remains 'frozen.' Kind of an infantile idea gone literary, like the 'everybody but me is a robot' thing which I think Vonnegut took up. Here the protagonist doesn't want to change the world, get rich, or screw with peoples' minds-- he just wants to see women naked. It sounds pretty damn childish when it's stated as bluntly as that, and yes it could sound offensive. But it's not. It's just the opposite because, simply, the protagonist loves women. Not just hot chicks or girls the protagonist has a thing for, but the fair sex in its totallity. The writing is infused with an intense, honest, and well-considered reverence for women and all things female, from an unapolagetically male point of view. What carried me through to the end of this hugely overgrown erotic novella was the outstanding writing. Sure, 'The Fermata' is literally navel-gazing and masturbatory, but the protagonist makes no bones about his 'gift,' he is keenly, hilariously self-aware of how lucky he is and how essentially innocent are his desires. This is reading as pleasure, one of the many minor subtexts of the book. Nicholson Baker never never stops offering the sharpest and most utterly original word-craft even when he's essentially given up on the plot itself. The tiniest tinge of pretention would've sunk this book and so it's a credit to the author that 'The Fermata' stays staunchly afloat. Baker's writing is what makes 'The Fermata' such a good read. Finally here is one of among several paragraphs and-or sections I found outstanding and which would pretty much define the entirety of 'The Fermata': \"The Fermata allows me ... to take in a paricular lived second of one woman's life, the incremental outcome of so many decisions and misfortunes and delights and griefs, while she is in the very midst of bringing it into being. The ability to investigate all aspects of her careless aliveness, where her clothes stretch, her body's textures, her expression, her smells, the way she happens to be standing or moving ... the daily fluidity of her life whose specific complex of qualities would have otherwise gone unseen by anyone-- unphotographed, uncelebrated, unvalued, unloved. It is their randomness and, often their very lack of overt sexiness that makes these instants so erotically precious.\""}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74111-chelsea", "userReview": "This was the last Nicholson Baker book I read.

Baker's protagonist Arno Strine is a 30-ish office temp in Boston purportedly writing his autobiography. His autobiography, however, is the tale of a devilish peeping Tom, who uses a gift to stop time to make manifest his voyeuristic fantasies about the female sex. Occasionally innocent (a peek at the items in a woman's purse). Occasionally risque (a ... \"full finger tracing\" of the body of a woman sitting still in time naked in her bathtub). If it sounds like the story of a man with the capacity to create, on command, simple masturbation fodder, it is. But the conceit is drawn by Baker with a sufficient degree of naivete, and always at a slight distance from sheer pornography, that the novel works shockingly well as a unique and titillating fantasy tale. Add to that Baker's general gift for placing clever, \"out there\" thoughts in his characters' minds -- that somehow seem rather kosher and believable on the page -- and his skill as both a writer and storyteller, and The Fermata becomes a singularly fascinating book about the pairing of invention and curiosity with desires and reveries both (and sometimes simultaneously) puerile and lurid."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2174591-cathy", "userReview": "I skimmed through the other reviews for this book and was a bit amused at the basic question of \"What would feminists think of this?\" or to paraphrase another way, \"Not sure women would like this book!\" As a woman, I had no problem with it.As a person, I loved this book!

But Nicholson Baker is probably the only author I know whose writing is actually sort of like Nabokov's. I'm not going to back up that assertion other than to say that there's a sub-story in The Fermata that contains the word \"dildungsroman.\" I sort of thought this book was going to be lame and/or repetitive, and certain parts of it definitely were (I'm looking at you, 20-page interpolations of Strine-penned amateur erotica). But what ended up making it really interesting was Arno Strine's ultimate dissatisfaction with his power. Yes, he can stop time and do all sorts of dirty things to women. But if he were really all about sexual gratification, wouldn't he just go around raping them? Which he never actually does (although that actually depends on your definition of rape), and which another minor character says he would, hypothetically. Despite his powers, Arno ends up reminiscing quite a bit about his old ex-girlfriend, with whom he had a comparatively normal relationship, and also devising ridiculous schemes to make some sort of personal connection with someone. For instance, he drives alongside a woman on the highway, stops time, makes a tape of his own (not too great) erotica, sticks it in her tape player, and goes back to his own car, only to see her toss the tape out the window later on. Granted, it's pretty hard to make moves on a girl you see on the highway, but that's what he does. I don't remember him even undressing her. And he's constantly lamenting the fact that when you stop time, people lose dimensions; their faces are less lively, etc. etc. and if he were to have sex with anyone, it'd be ruined by the lack of reaction, of interaction. And that rings true. Arno would for the most part rather have love than sex, which is why he never does the horrible things that other people might. And in that way, as he argues at one point, maybe he does deserve it."}, {"userName": "Arun Divakar", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar", "userReview": "A version of the bullock-powered mill was prominently used in India as much as six-seven decades ago. Tied to a central hub that grinds grain or extracts oil, the bullock traverses a circular course. This path never varies nor does it move one inch away from the center. I took this example as it is very close to  The Fermata  in its execution. The center of this literary mill is sexuality of the voyeuristic kind and there is hardly anything else in the book ! A thirty year old man who is by nature an introvert has the amazing capacity to stop time dead on its tracks. And what does he do when the entire universe is stopped ? Does he steal ? Does he spy ? Nope, he goes around undressing women and gaze for his heart's ( & his organ's) fill of naked bodies ! I found this extremely odd but after a few chapters I realized that the whole point was to cram in the maximum of sexual fetishes. The erotic parts are elaborately written with the same level of detail as any other piece of erotica. This more or less sums up the plot part of the book.Now I get to the reason as to why I give this book two stars. Nicholson Baker's writing is top notch. A simple act of lying in the sun after removing your glasses is made into a shining paragraph that left me wanting to re-read it again. Baker takes the most unassuming of things : reading a book, washing up after wild sex or even writing a sentence on a piece of tissue and transforms them into pieces of exemplary writing. On taking a look at the entire picture of the book, I feel that it was erotic fiction with gems of acture observation and brilliant writing scattered throughout !"}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "With Online Porn Explosion, 1994 Novel Lost Target Market: 15-17 yr old heterosexual male readers\nYet, if you're intrigued by, for example, the unfiltered, uncensored thoughts of a 16-year-old boy in novel form, you may wanna check this one out.I read of some who've opined that this novel was made by cobbling together rejects from the inventive Penthouse Forum/Letters magazine? If you've never heard of it, this periodical was an offshoot for the more popular Penthouse magazine, each issue containing dozens of \"letters\" (written anonymously by \"real people\" about risky, risque' sexual encounters ). In conducting research for this review, it appears that out-of-work screenwriters, playwrights and fiction writers \"created\" some of these letters. The \"letters\" that were rejected by Forum, it seems, were those that detailed \"escapades\" that were too boring, overly absurd or simply nauseating for consumption by the general public.

'The Fermata' is quite different! Basically, it's porn. But not porn that I found appealing. It's written in the form of a memoir of a seemingly ordinary man who works as a temp transcriptionist - who has the ability to stop time. Rather than using this power to do any of the obvious possibilities (heists, assassinations, blackmail(?)), he uses his time in 'the fermata' pretty much exclusively to molest women. Morally, he tries to justify himself by saying that he's not hurting anyone - the women are totally unaware about what's been done to their frozen, unresponsive bodies, so what's the problem? The character has an ex-girlfriend, who broke up with him because she was disturbed and repelled by what she believed were his fantasies regarding these actions - and I'm totally with her: the exciting thing about sex is the seduction, the interaction. Molesting mannequin-like, unmoving bodies is thoroughly unexciting. Later in the book, when the narrator decides to try his hand at writing erotica (and placing it for women to read), the stories presented as his writing aren't terribly my cup of tea, either. This is undeniably a well-done book, but it is just meant to appeal to people with different fantasies than mine."}, {"userName": "Marsha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8349963-marsha", "userReview": "The protagonist of this story has a fetish.
