In 1879 she travels to Ireland to carry out research for a book she is writing, and there she learns first hand how harshly the poor are treated. She also meets the dashing Irish rebel, Michael Davitt, and the indomitable Mrs Delia Parnell. Her experiences in Ireland stir complex emotions, and confirm a strong desire to help the cause of Irish independence through writing and fund-raising. Over the next decade her loyalties to her devious husband Alex are sorely tested and, as things become more complicated at home and abroad, Margaret has many difficult decisions to make.From the moment we meet Margaret on a storm-tossed boat, her passions and doubts feel real to the reader. Her own struggles with the gender discrimination of the era are convincingly described, and the reader can\u2019t help but empathise with the choices she has to make regarding career and family; a dilemma that still resonates today. We also feel for Margaret as she is personally drawn into the struggle of the Irish and the discrimination the poor suffer at the hands of the landlords. This is a love story too. Margaret and Michael\u2019s meeting on the boat, their all-too-brief reunions and poignant goodbyes are beautifully written.The little details of life in the 1880s and the real historical events involving the Land League and the secret activities of the Clan na Gael are well researched, and the play between fiction and non-fiction is deftly handled. I have some minor criticisms about the handling of the passage of time in the book. I also feel that Michael is a little underwritten, but maybe this is because, along with Margaret, I want to spend more time with this enigmatic hero. But the positives far outweigh those small criticisms. This novel successfully explores a fascinating time in social and political history within the context of a love story, and the espionage storyline is excellent; along with Margaret you are never a hundred per cent sure who to trust. This is a historical novel that captures the imagination of the modern-day reader.The author very kindly sent me a review copy in advance of the publication of the Kindle edition of this book."}, {"userName": "Shawn Scarber Deggans ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1731700-shawn-scarber-deggans", "userReview": "For the love of Ireland is an amazingly well developed historical novel that charts ten years in the life of Margaret Sullivan.Margaret writes for the \u2018Chicago Tribune\u2019 under a male pseudonym and at first she seems quite content with her arrangement. As a woman, few men would even consider the possibility she could be a journalist. This is a good arrangement for her politically ambitious husband, Alex Sullivan. When she journeys to Ireland and meets the charismatic rebel Michael Davitt, she instantly builds an attraction to both him and the social cause of freedom for Ireland from the brutal landlordism practiced during the late 1800s. This sets up Margaret\u2019s adventure as she fights to help the Irish cause through her controlling and abusive husband and her own writing talents. The novel is an educational historical read, a close examination of the treatment of women during this time period, a suspenseful political thriller, and a romance. Often when an author has this many different threads, the novel comes across as tacked-together and haphazard, but Leslie has created a wonderful blend set to a pace that remains fast and yet still captures details specific to that time period. The characterization of Margaret, Davitt, and other historical figures is handled with great care allowing for a riveting story mixed with factual details. I actually listened to this novel read by voice actress Susanna Burney. Susanna did a wonderful job of capturing unique voices for all of the characters, accurately handling a multitude of accents, and delivering a quality performance. I\u2019m amazed to discover this is a debut novel. It reads like a novel written by someone who has been writing bestsellers for years. If the quality of this novel is indicative of Judy Leslie\u2019s future work I\u2019ll be buying and reading [or listening to] everything she writes."}, {"userName": "M.K.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9390647-m-k", "userReview": "I won this book in a first-reads giveaway.

Margaret Sullivan is a successful journalist in the early 1880s married to Alex an influential lawyer in Chicago. When she travels to Ireland to report on the \u201ctroubles\u201d there she witnesses abject poverty and the harsh treatment of renters by British landlords. She meets Michael Davitt, a dedicated leader in the quest for Irish independence, and finds in him a compelling contrast to her husband. Back in Chicago Margaret and Alex devote themselves to the grand cause, following different paths, and Margaret finds herself questioning her marriage to an increasingly nasty man. Alex, for his part, rises steadily in Irish-America circles and assumes leadership of an organization which on the surface appears to be dedicated to peaceful means of opposing British rule. Meanwhile his jealousy and sense of possession makes Margaret\u2019s life increasingly difficult. Ultimately she will decide to leave him, breaking the bonds of her Catholic training and the Victorian era\u2019s definitions of how a woman should act. Leslie does a marvelous job of showing the ebb and flow of Margaret\u2019s thinking about the marriage and her emotional attachment to Michael Davitt. You\u2019ll have to read the book to see how it all turns out. Leslie has taken actual personalities from the era and constructed a fine story around them. In an after word she explains the ways in which she has departed from reality and provides as well a listing of the books she drew up to provide the historical context."}, {"userName": "Joyce Shaughnessy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5722108-joyce-shaughnessy", "userReview": "For the Love of Ireland by author Judy Leslie, is one of the most skillfully written, expressive, and interesting books I have ever read from a first time author.

To the Irish, it is a poem, a myth, a clan, a country. To the British, Ireland is a possession they don\u2019t want to release.She is a place of happiness and love, also sadness and sorrow. Ireland is like Venus to many men, turning their hearts and creating warriors out of peasants. She is an idea many would lay down their life for. \u201cThis is the prologue quote that is in both the book and the audiobook: an attempt to prepare the reader for the events to come in this story. Closely directed by the thoughts and travels of Margaret Sullivan, the story mixes fiction, history, romance and a sense of the republicanism that is evident in Ireland to this day. Margaret is an interesting, if not wholly impressive to me, character. I can admit to a real prejudice against women who maintain their independent view and approach when they act in a completely contrary manner. Margaret is, for her time, an unusual woman: a journalist, traveling for 2 months without her husband to rediscover the land of her birth and write a story. While that alone is worth recognition since women of the late 1800\u2019s were rarely in the workforce, her submission to her husband, and refusal to make a clear break from her marriage all felt as if she was insecure in her own convictions and made her less than admirable. What Judy Leslie did manage to do with Margaret however, was to create a situation in which her choices would become the center of a climax point, and making her character work for that point. The integration of historical events and carefully describing and detailing the places, as well as providing a clear set of explanations to the republican feelings of the Irish she encounters, including the radical solutions and options proposed by Michael are very \u2018of the moment\u2019 and help to elucidate the emotion behind the struggle for home rule. Adding in the fraternal organization of Clan na Gael and the emotions that are stirred in Irish living abroad for their homeland are all presented with an eye to the prolific and often polemic propaganda and rallying cries of the organizations. Narration is provided by Susanna Burney who manages to deliver the story without over reliance on vocal manipulation to illustrate the different characters. Her accents are softly delivered and tone is well-modulated, providing a story that is easy to listen to at any pace. There are traces of regional accents and inflections that fit well with the characters, and the emotion behind the words that is written into the story provides a subtle reinforcement of the words being spoken. This was a story that had moments of brilliance, and is written much like a love story to the many who struggled for home rule, while providing a lead character that will not always engender sympathy, but completely fits the story as it is told, and her motivations and history are exposed. Not a quick read, this is one to savor and enjoy, stirring the travel bug in those who have never seen the \u201cEmerald Isle\u201d for themselves, no matter their genealogy. I received an AudioBook copy of the book from the author for purpose of honest review for the Heard Word.

I know I have read an excellent book when it motivates me to read more about the actually history of a particular period. In this case the Irish 19th century \u201ctroubles.\u201dHer story takes place in a fairly recent (19th century) explosive and transitional time in Irish history. She has adopted real characters and woven them into a story of unrequited love (for most of the book) around the actual struggle by the active and passive (mostly active) \u201crebels\u201d for Irish independence. Having personally lived in the United Kingdom in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s I saw a bit of this sectarian explosiveness first hand. Her main antagonist, Margaret Frances Buchanan Sullivan, is an intelligent and strong-willed woman born in Ireland and moved with her mother to the USA as a child. She is now a journalist with the Chicago Tribune living in Chicago married to Alex Sullivan whom she endures. On a boat trip to Ireland to conduct research for a book she meets Michael Davitt (real person). Mr. Davitt has been on a fund raising trip to the USA and is heading home to Ireland. As a member/former member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, as many of his associates have, he has served a bit of time in a British prison. She is smitten immediately by his cultured charm, rugged looks and stoical Irish independence stance (\u201cShe found him interesting and she liked him immensely\u201d). They part upon reaching England but meet again at Irish M.P. Charles Parnell\u2019s (real person) home. Michael visits Charles Parnell\u2019s house. The more she is around Michael the more she is drawn to him. However\u2026Margaret eventually returns home to a husband she really can\u2019t stand (reads dime store novels vice classics or history) but tolerates. Her husband does have influence in the American Irish community. As a member of the Clan Na Gael and later president he welds a bit of influence and action behind the scenes. This is where a Clan Na Gael member Henri Le Caron (real person) appears in the story and later has an impact on their lives. The battle with her husband continues and she returns to Ireland for more research. After various adventures including Alex turning up in Ireland, where after an action scene, Alex will bother her no more. Perhaps Margaret and Michael will live happier ever after? Excellent first novel that keeps the story moving and provides a bit of education on the Irish \u201ctroubles.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Sheila", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142441-sheila", "userReview": "The historical detail in this novel is impressive, the time period and subject matter fascinating.

For that reason, the character of Margaret seems especially well-developed, and I sympathized with her. But the main source of interest for me was the plight of the poor Irish tenants, ousted from their homes for non-payment of rent.

The story captures successful journalist Irish born Margaret Sullivan living in Chicago writing for a major newspaper under a nom de plume. Margaret married powerful and successful attorney Alex Sullivan as a vehicle to access the political and wealthy body of late 1800s America, access she'd otherwise not be privy to. Alex was at times crude and abusive at home while outside secretly involved in the American Irish support movement and fundraising. On a trip to Ireland to gather research for a book she intends to write, she meets young Irish activist Michael Davitt (another historical figure) whom Leslie uses as a romantic interest for Margaret. She is drawn to Michael as strongly as she withdraws from Alex, whose suspicious activities have lately escalated. The Irish American branch of the Land League in America was known as Clan na Gael. The Irish Land League in Ireland sought to rescue the tenants evicted or burned out by their British landlords when they were unable to pay exorbitant rent.The protagonist, Margaret, is well developed, but obsesses over Michael while decrying her own husband. Granted, Alex is made to look like a despot, while Michael a hero (and he was). I had some difficulty connecting with Margaret. Michael isn't fully fleshed and it might have been interesting to get more of his backstory. This is the author's debut novel and the flow of dialogue, particularly in the first part of the book, appeared a bit awkward. This smoothes out somewhat, but then the reader confronts a few typos or edit misses. Still, a very compelling story of the British/Irish conflict during this time with historical characters come to life in a believable, well-researched scenario including factual events.I received this timely (March) ebook download from BookBub and was very happy to read and review.

This dark story is based on actual events connecting Margaret and Alexander Sullivan of late 19th Century Chicago with Ireland\u2019s efforts to win independence from Britain. Margaret Sullivan struggles to find her own way as a journalist, beset by an unhappy marriage. But she is well conditioned to trade her freedom and integrity for her husband\u2019s financial support. She closes her eyes to the implications of her husband\u2019s involvement in the secretive Clan na Gael in exchange for his social connections and for the illusion of a successful career, where she must use pseudonyms and is accepted by few. When Margaret leaves home, dazzled by charismatic Irish leader Michael Davitt, the reader wants her never to return. But inevitably, her husband, based on the historical Alexander Sullivan, shown here to be a bullying and manipulative leader of the Clan na Gael, turns violent and tracks her down. Margaret must face down her fears and decide if she will renounce her husband and her way of life. The question remains, as the price for her freedom escalates, does Margaret deserve a happy ending?This story may be worth reading for its insight into the people behind the Irish National League of America and their efforts to win support for the various Land Acts that would have improved conditions for the Irish poor. Additionally, the social restrictions of the late 19th Century on women of a certain class are quite clear as is the suffering of the Irish poor when the Land Acts failed. Betrayals occur everywhere at great cost. Margaret ultimately comes to understand that she failed to protect those she loves, and she is betrayed by those who purport to love her. This story suggests that a blind eye to reality and fervent prayer do not replace integrity or justice. Perhaps the lesson is that neither history nor unhappy marriages can be rewritten to have a happy ending.

She is an admired journalist with the Chicago Tribune publishing under a male nom de plume. Her unscrupulous husband is a prominent attorney and power broker with aspirations of his own. They are well-connected members of Chicago\u2019s 1880s Irish elite. On her trip to Ireland to do research for a book she is writing, Margaret meets a charming one-armed Irish rebel named Michael and finds herself attracted to him and his ideas for liberating Ireland. While traveling through the stone-walled back roads of the island, Margaret sees for herself how the poor are treated. She breaks her vow never to get involved, and soon questions if she can ever go back to her old superficial life in Chicago again.
