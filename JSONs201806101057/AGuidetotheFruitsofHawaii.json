It's also my pick of the group of six.Set some time in the future, after vampires have taken over, the narrator is a human worker in a vampire-owned concentration camp that holds healthy humans for blood production. We watch her past, as a vampire's ally and pet and the tiny part she played in the undead ascension, catch up with her. We watch her begin truly understand what the vampires have done to humanity. And we watch her come to the understanding that she doesn't really want to be one of them after all, no matter the dreams she's held onto since she was a teenager. Of course, the choice has never actually been hers, anyway. The story pulled me through with a strong sense of itself and a couple of interesting twists on vampires that built the world a little more and added to the experience. Not being particularly a vampire fan most of the time, it isn't likely I would have selected this tale on my own, but I'm glad I read it."}, {"userName": "Jack Miller", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28184038-jack-miller", "userReview": "Read in The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2015Set in a future world where vampires have taken over and keep humans around only in camps where they feed off them like livestock. One woman tells of her experiences as one of the last humans with some sense of freedom and partnership with the vampires.I am sorry to say that my preconceived ideas about vampires and vampire stories may have tainted my view of this story. It did bring about some new ideas of vampires and I specifically enjoyed the ideas of different grades of humans blood and how you can evoke different emotions in the humans to give their blood a distinct taste. However, any story that involves romantic or even semi-romantic relationships with vampires hits a sour spot in my brain that I can't seem to overcome."}, {"userName": "Norman Cook", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4081587-norman-cook", "userReview": "2015 Nebula Award Novelette Winner.After reading all the Hugo Award novelette nominees, I wanted to see how they measured up to one of the better reviewed stories of 2014. Short answer: they didn't.Although there seemed to be some missing backstory of how vampires came to rule Earth, the actual story of a human woman who voluntarily serves the vampires by administering a concentration camp where humans are kept \"on tap\" because she is in love with one of the vampires is an intriguing one. Her dilemma becomes whether to give herself up to become a vampire or to help her human charges escape their incarceration.
