I do wish it had a different title, though. While this book does offer help in parenting a strong-willed child, it's really for parenting any child and I think many who could be helped by this book will pass it over because they don't have a Strong-Willed Child. Hinckley does a great job of demonstrating our own need, as parents, to make changes before we can expect any change to happen with our children. I really love his whole family approach to raising children. without making a parent feel discouraged or guilty, Hinckley points out the ways we need to strengthen ourselves in order to strengthen our children."}, {"userName": "Don", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1173901-don", "userReview": "This is a good book from a Mormon auther to mostly a Mormon reader. I particularly enjoyed the information about why individuals rebel or behave badly. The book ends encouraging parents to submit their will to Christ and in turn enjoy the blessings and benefits that come from that as evident in their childrens lives."}, {"userName": "Cherene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1204165-cherene", "userReview": "I often lament that there is no manual for how to parent teenagers. I often feel unsure of the decisions I make as a parent. Well this book is a huge help! It is written from an LDS perspective, and incorporates gospel principles into a parenting manual. I started implementing some of the things I learned from this book as I was reading it, and noticed a positive change right away in my relationship with my teenage son, and in the whole family dynamic. The first few chapters are interesting, but the really helpful info starts around chapter 8. If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. It has so much great stuff to think about, and instead of just giving instructions on exactly how to handle specific situations (although it does give several examples and suggestions), it teaches us how to evaluate ourselves as parents, our motives, and our methods, so that we can discover for ourselves what the right response might be to any given situation. I own the book, and would be happy to lend it out if anyone local wants to borrow it! (I got it at Seagull Bookstore, and it was on sale for $3.99.)"}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/806278-sally", "userReview": "That \"I'm on page...\" feature does not work for me. :) I read the table of contents first, peruse the index, then read the forward/preface/chapter 1. That inevitably leads me back to the toc, and index, then a chapter in the middle, then to several references. Then back to the beginning, then perhaps the last chapter, then back to the middle. I guess I process information differently than the author supposes I might....Chapter one explores the Premortal Rebellion. Rebellion in mortality is nothing new, which is sort of reassuring and tiring at the same time. Chapter three explores the difference between self-esteem (I'm inherintly great and can do anything I want to, forget the consequences) and divine-esteem (I'm of infinite worth because of where I came from and my potential, but must never forget to whom I owe every breath and my salvation; I can do anything that is good, through God's grace, but I live in a universe of moral laws and consequences, good and bad).Coming next are marriage (ch 4) and parenting styles (ch 5-8), and more."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1750937-lisa", "userReview": "This book surprised me. I thought it would be a \"how to\" book with examples and \"to do\" lists. It was but not in the usual way. It really pushed me to examine myself and where I am at on my spiritual journey as a person first, THEN as a parent. While I wish I had this book when my kids were younger, I don't know if I would have appreciated the concepts presented as much then as I do now as a more mature spiritual being. I have discovered that I am the barrier between myself and God and that I have habits that keep me from becoming the person God wants me to be, habits I am too afraid to let go of because I am afraid of how powerful I might be - like the Nelson Mandela quote. Very thought-provoking book. I find myself reflecting on it and referring to it again and again. And to think I got it on a whim, not because I have any SWC of my own but to help me with my calling over the Young Adults."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2007829-kristen", "userReview": "I read this book twice. The first time I skipped through to find all of the parts that were important for me at that very moment. I needed a little peace and a few answers, so I read the chapters to help me through.The second time I read the entire book through. The basic psychology was amazingly profound and any parent, with any kind of child, would gain a lot of incite into who they are personally and how to be a better parent by reading this book. I think I will be a better mother to all of my kids from ideas and information that seemed to resonate with me as I read.I also feel a lot more peace in regard to my SWC (strong-willed child). I appreciated the stories given, the parental suggestions and the call to strengthen my own faith in the Lord. I can see my SWC through new eyes and I have renewed strength as a parent."}, {"userName": "Aimee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/925253-aimee", "userReview": "This is my new favorite parenting book. If you are LDS and looking for a faith-based approach to parenting difficult children, this book is a great choice. (The other must-have is Christlike Parenting by Glenn Latham.) Hinckley actually spends most of the book talking about rebellion, its causes and its spiritual ramifications. As I read, I found myself identifying some of my own personality traits in there, which is making this book as useful for my own personal growth as it is for my parenting. The other thing that really stood out to me about this book is the way that Hinckley acknowledges that parents are themselves a work in progress and that we neither are nor can be perfect. He gives thought to the intersection between parent-ness and person-ness that I've never really seen so explicit in any other parenting book. I, for one, appreciated that."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/689955-tina", "userReview": "I love this book! Having known the author and his children for several years, I felt confident that this book would be of value. Afterall, he did a great job with his own family! Additionally, the author and his wife helped me through their support and encouragement to survive a stage when I had 3 kids all under the age of 5. I think this should be a MUST read for all parents! It really has fantastic advice for all parents, not just those of us who have a strong-willed child. I really truly wish he would have written this book years ago. Now, I need to figure out how to un-do years of mistakes.I've already bought an extra copy of the book to lend to other people and I think I'll give it as a gift this year as well."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6352428-rebecca", "userReview": "This is the 2nd book I've read by Kevin Hinckley. I really like his style of writing. This book is so much more than the title reads. That's the reason I liked it so much. There is a lot to discover about who we are in relationship to our children - and for everyone that we associate with for that matter. If you need or want counsel of dealing with a child - young or adult even - then this book has a great approach. It's not a \"feel good\" book. Neither is it a \"psych out the child\" or \"belittle the parent\" book. But it is a step by step book unfolded by the author to describe what he thinks, and statistically proven, ways to approach a challenging subject with objectivity and honesty. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make a positive impact in the life of a child."}, {"userName": "Amber Hicken", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1089614-amber-hicken", "userReview": "I loved this book. The one complaint I do have is that the title of the book is misleading. This book is appropriate for any parent or youth leader, whether dealing with a strong-willed child or not. He includes great insight into the scriptures and how to parent by learning from examples in the scriptures as well as from our Heavenly Father. He explains some of the strategies that Satan uses to mislead our youth, which are no different from those he used in our premortal life. I have already applied some of the the things I learned from this book in my parenting and have found them very effective. Highly recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Hunybe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1544508-hunybe", "userReview": "This book caught my eye at the bookstore but I passed it up. A week later, after multiple run ins with my own strong willed child, I went back to get it. This is not your typical parenting guide. The advice was very timely for me, and I really want to institute some changes in my parenting based on some of its ideas. The problem is that parenting is a team sport..and my hubby hasn't felt as urgent in his need to read this book. My suggestion would be to read it with your spouse, then you can have a real discussion about what to do to best raise your own children."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1035058-teresa", "userReview": "I've never been so interested in a \"parenting\" book. Helpful for any parent, not just those parenting \"strong willed children\", this gave me so many things to think about regarding parenting styles, discipline, children's personalities, and ways to teach better as a parent to help children become capable adults, all with a gospel perspective. I wish I'd known much of this eariler, but am very grateful I have it as resource now.

It was great to read a parenting book from an LDS perspective. I agreed with almost everything he had to say. It containted a lot of useful things to keep in mind as my children grow up.

This blows the socks off of any other parenting book I have read. It is geared toward the LDS parent, Bishopric or youth leader but his counsel is beyond limits and will teach you things you never knew you did not understand. He takes simple concepts and opens them up to life changing shifts.

At times, the insights into parenting delve into really profound gospel subjects. Other times, they respond to current psychology or social trends.

This book is about every child, not just challenging ones, and it applies to children of all ages.
