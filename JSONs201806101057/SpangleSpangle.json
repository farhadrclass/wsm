I was a bit unsure at first, but before I knew it, I was digging it. I mean, how many historical fiction books about the circus had I read before? Exactly none. The descriptions of circus life and living were very detailed and for all I can surmise, accurate as well. Some of the characters have long names which get annoying to read again and again, but so many of them come and go that it doesn't matter. Indeed, there are so many characters, and some so strange it doesn't really pay to get attached to them. But you won't want for lack of variety! The landscape is another constantly changing character as they march across continents, sail across oceans, pass through seasons and wars. I like learning bits of history while being entertained, and in a variety of languages, too! And everything is conveniently explained to the less world-savvy characters in the novel, so the reader never feels left out of the loop. There is a bit of bawdiness in the book, but what I think could be more offensive to sensitive readers would be the blatant racism and sexism which are a reflection of the times. There's an unhealthy dose of animal cruelty as well. Keep in mind, this story takes place at the end of the 19th century in a circus setting, with some wars mixed in. All in all, pretty light, considering. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good bit of escapism, and something different."}, {"userName": "Abc", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45993514-abc", "userReview": "Bellissimo libro, che conferma la stima che nutro nei confronti di Jennings, davvero un abile narratore!Ho apprezzato particolarmente il personaggio di Florian, il pater familias di questo gruppo circense che gira l'Europa partendo dalla lontana America. Personaggio scoppiettante, grande affabulatore, ricco di risorse, capace anche di imbrogli, ma molto umano e sempre disposto a venire incontro alle esigenze di ogni singolo componente del suo circo, perch\u00e8 \"bisogna risolvere i problemi man mano che si presentano\".Non voglio discutere della validit\u00e0 storica di ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 narrato, penso che il romanzo abbia un maggior valore da un punto di vista strettamente \"umano\". I personaggi sono tutti ben caratterizzati, ognuno con le sue ambizioni, i suoi problemi e le sue risorse. Davvero un mondo estremamente variegato quello che ci viene presentato e non ci viene nemmeno risparmiata la crudezza di certi episodi, il che, a mio parere, contribuisce a rendere tutto pi\u00f9 realistico.L'unica nota negativa riguarda la lunghezza. Forse se alcune parti fossero state sfrondate la lettura ne avrebbe giovato.

Spangle is a tome and a half yet I was so enthralled I often found myself worrying it would end too soon. There are so many memorable characters. Florian, Edge and Clover Lee would be the stars but the supporting cast is just compelling. As the circus travels across post Civil War America and finally on to Europe they are joined by new acts. I don't think it's a spoiler to point out that there are always openings as performers are trampled, impaled, immolated and worse. As in Aztec there is Grand Guignol aplenty. Nobody is safe. Gary Jennings certainly took William Faulkner's advice to \"kill your darlings\" to heart. My sole objection is the occasional use of stereotypes. Vengeful lesbians, pedophile midgets and noble Southrons. But for each of these there is a wholly unexpected and intriguing character you've never met.

The book is a huge time-investment - clocking in at almost 900 pages - and yet with all that length, Jennings does not manage to engender any feeling for the characters. He is an incredibly detail-oriented writer, and I could practically envision the boxes of index cards that must have contained all the factoids he included. The characters all talk like tour guides, so they aren't realistic. For a book set in the circus, there is a relatively small aamount of information about the acts. There is, however, a great deal of information about the Franco-Prussian War. Disappointing for a circus-lover, it would be a nightmare for anyone not enamored of the Big Top."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24039814-william", "userReview": "La edici\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol Lentejuelas, es uno de los mejores libros que he le\u00eddo.Me sorprende como Gary evoluciona la historia de los diferentes personajes a trav\u00e9s de una historia circense con tal profundidad.En mi opini\u00f3n esta obra es aun mejor que Azteca, ya que en Lentejuelas hay una mayor variedad de culturas, que incluso te hace sentir estar en varios de esos lugares.Desde Am\u00e9rica hasta Par\u00eds, este libro brinda un viaje incre\u00edble, y aunque alguna que otra parte se me hizo tediosa, en general cada cap\u00edtulo del libro es exquisito.Terminaras encari\u00f1ado con varios personajes y lo contrario con varios otros.En fin, un must read para los que disfrutaron Azteca y para todo aquel que quiera vivir una gran aventura a trav\u00e9s de las letras."}, {"userName": "David Koblos", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14294972-david-koblos", "userReview": "Jennings is such a disappointment! I was actually looking forward to reading this book, and getting a glimpse into the mysterious world of late 19th century Europe, along with all kinds of anecdotes, interesting connections of people and places, and above all, the inner workings of a traveling circus. The latter part was okay, but it did not make up for the horrendous historical, geographical, and linguistic errors. Province of Slovakia? Yugoslavia? And let me not start on some of the characters. While some seem to learn effortlessly the local languages, the Korean trio doesn't seem to be able to communicate their own names or the fact that they are Korean to their fellow artists.

So much. Raptor, Aztec, and The Journeyer are among my top 5 favourite books. I have between 3-5 copies of each of them because I read them so often that I'm paranoid that the books will fall apart, and I'll never be able to replace them, so I need back ups. My first copy of Raptor is literally held together with packing tape and good intentions; i can't read it anymore because it WILL fall apart, but I won't get rid of it, even though I have other copies, because I'm that sentimental about it.And Spangle was my elusive unicorn. I've looked for this book for damn near 15 years. And finally, at long last, my favourite little local used book store came through and found a copy.So to say there was a huge build up is an understatement. I only mention it because I can't figure out if that's the reason I'm SO disappointed with it. 200 pages in I was not only struggling to stay engaged, but I'd had the realization that nothing had happened yet! None of the character development, sex, violence, narrative voices, or historical detail that his other books had in abundance, were present in Spangle. Even the basics of any novel, like a conflict, or a real plot, were absent. I hate to admit it, but I'm giving up...and I almost never do that. I'm hoping that if I stop reading it, and try it again down the road, that my expectations won't be so high, and maybe I'll be able to enjoy it \u2639\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Birgit", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66586708-birgit", "userReview": "Dies ist ein historischer Roman \u00fcber die Abenteuer eines Zirkusunternehmens im letzten Drittel des 19.

The wealth of material here is staggering, the author must have lived and breathed in the circus world for years. I think I have read on Wikipedia that he joined no less than 8 different circus acts on the road. I feel saturated now, after the last page in eclectic terms designed to confuse the \"rube\" or \"josser\"- that is the uninitiated - in a way similar to sailors who have their own names for familiar things. There's also the exhilarating mix of languages that the author has chosen to preserve in order to respect the cosmopolite origins of the troupe members and to give texture to their personalities. This might cerate problems for some readers, but luckily I come from the Balkans where having a modic understanding of Slavonic terms, English , French , German and Italian isn't all that difficult to acquire.Back to Florian's Flourishing Florilegium of Wonders : I was caught in their limelight and enchanted right from their first entrance, in the aftermath of the Civil War, when they are just a handful of pennyless artists trying to scrape a living in a mud show and getting paid in tobacco leafs and foodstuffs. There are many emotionally charged moments in the book, as the tropue follow the dream of being recognized as the Greatest Show on Earth, but none had the same impact as the very first performance when the ragged band of beggars is somehow - magically? - transformed into the stuff that dreams are made of.So, I followed their fate across the Atlantic, from Florence to Innsbruck, and from Munchen to Vienna, across the puszta to Budapest and then to Moscow, Leningrad and the final apotheosis of Paris - the City of Lights. I laughed, and I cried and I held to the edge of my seat as ordinary people explored the limits of what is possible and sometimes paid the ultimate price for being a daredevil.What is this fascination with the Circus? What moves these people to chose life on the road? I will let Gary Jennings explain with a couple of quotes from the book:\"We like to think of circus as an art, and I would hardly rank art as a trifle,\" said Florian. Indeed, ours is the oldest art there is \u2014 performing. Also the most ephemeral of arts, I have to admit that. We strike light across the air, yes. But, like light on air, we leave no mark, no trace, no history. Poets leave thoughts, artists leave visions\u2014even warriors leave deeds. We do nothing but entertain, and we don't pretend we're doing anything more significant. We come into humdrum communities where pinched little people lead commonplace lives, and we bring them a bit of novelty, a touch of the exotic. For the space of a day perhaps, we give those people a look at gloss and gossamer, danger and daring, a laugh and a thrill they may never have had before. And then, like a dream or a fairy tale \u2014 or what the Scots call glamour \u2014 we are gone and forgotten.\"---\"No actor was ever an actor until he started acting. And nobody ever knows what extraordinary things he may be capable of, until he tries something out of the ordinary. That's what the circus is, Obie \u2014 a stretching of the limits of the possible, a defiance of the strictures of the commonplace, a realization that the impossible can be possible.\"---And Edge felt on his face that old familiar breeze that blows always from the far places and beckons: \"come see what I have seen.\"---For all my enthusiasm about the book, I still think it has a few problems, especially in the second half of the journey. The infodumps are cleverly inserted into the story and relevant to the progress of the plot, but still they are numerous and add a lot of baggage. This wasn't so much of an issue at the start when I learned about the behind the scenes tricks and sleight-of-hand of each performer, but later they are mostly about a travel guide through 19 century Europe and numerous trivia about countries and places. The final chapters in Paris are also heavily political and confirm a certain fascination on the part of the author for the elite and for the crowned heads.Another slight issue is a certain soap opera flavor to the human interest stories, where the same plot devices are used repeatedly until they lose some of the emotional impact and become predictable. Also, the growing number of performers and supporting cast meant less time could be spent on their individual fate or acts and the focus was moved to outside events. Part of my actual job is as a safety engineer, and I must say - Florian's enterprise has a dismal record even for 19 century.Some of the choices of the author in regards political corectness I'm sure add a lot of realism to his setting, but still the overt racism, calousness and sexual abuse of children make for an uncomfortable read sometimes. Like I said, I believe this is a generally accurate depiction of the mentality of the times, and there are numerous examples that Circus artists may be amoral, but not without an ingrained sense of justice where tresspassers are dealt with succintly. Actually, in their multicultural environment they were probably at the forefront of the liberal movement. Here's another worthy quote from the book:\"we must never let ourselves be bound by propriety, precedent, convention or morality; those things are recipes for banality\"so, what is the spangle : a cheap piece of metal sewn into a fleshling? or a magical bit of starlight caught in the net of dreams?saltaverunt ... placuerunt ... mortui sunt ..."}, {"userName": "\u00c1", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/563877", "userReview": "Spangle isn't a bad book. I'm embarrassed to say that frankly. However Jennings' books have a certain pattern that always diminishes them in my opinion. When I talk about his books I'm talking about the big three; Aztec, Journeyer, and Spangle. Don't get me started on Raptor. I think I consigned my copy to the fires of hell. Though I think hell didn't want that crap either and it may be propping up a table, or being dissolved in battery acid, or tossed in the cooling pool in a nuclear power plant.Anyway, there comes a point in the plot of the big three, maybe two-thirds of the way in, where the mood suddenly darkens. Our protagonists go from carefree, fornicating, luck-wielding, heroes to glum, brooding, and ever-fearfully-watching-over-their-shoulder Jobs (in the biblical sense). This isn't as bad in Spangle, but it's there in it and certainly in the the others. This always takes the books from historical romps to drudgery. I assume they were meant to show that our protagonists struggle with the consequences of what they've done, but for me they darken the books to the point of almost unreadability. The books go great up to that point and then Jennings applied the mood breaks and screeeeech!In Aztec this happened after our hero has settled in Tenochtitlan and now must fearfully await the strike of his nemesis what's-his-name (which is a literary term). In Journeyer you have all the intrigue, plots, subplots, and subsubplots in the court of Genghis Khan along with a weird dose of, well weirdness with Marco's uncle. Spangle has it as well, but I have a bad memory so I forget where.This tone change is honestly why seconds after I think to myself I'll read them again, I cannot bring myself to up the books. No amount of sex, violence, more sex, and historical background (and sex) adequately make up for the sudden spiral of bleh that suddenly engulf the characters and plot.Still, Spangle,Aztec, and Journeyer aren't bad. They just aren't all that good."}, {"userName": "Justin Lantier-Novelli", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47108220-justin-lantier-novelli", "userReview": "Gary did his homework obviously. The attention to detail was astounding. I've never been to most of the places he described, but he knew street names and what specific buildings looked like. He also utilized his time with various circuses to his advantage, explaining in sometimes excruciating detail how people dressed, acted, the lingo, and the behind-the-scenes working of a traveling troupe. However, those were the only good things about this novel. If you are a fan of historical fiction that paints a 'still-life' portrait of a time or a place, this is a great novel for you. If you are like me though and prefer plot and character development to drive a story with some fun details and description thrown in for authenticity, this is not the book for you. Only one of the tertiary characters showed any development (Sunday Simms), the rest ended the book either the same way they began or they ended it dead. The dialog was fun at times, and I laughed out loud once or twice. Overall though, there lacked any plot whatsoever. And it was Bible thick - almost 900 pages. If he had limited the characters to only a dozen or so, and cut his description of the places and costumes in half, he might have had a winner with a 500 page story - obviously he needed some more plot development as well.The last thing I'd like to add is that if you're a fan of the circus in general, it's a fun read simply for that alone."}, {"userName": "Juan Navarro", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23718370-juan-navarro", "userReview": "Well, Gary Jennings tried to stray away a little in this historical fiction and really the book is quite good, however is inferior compared to Aztec or Raptor. The US part was very very slow but when the troupe lands in Italy, Weeks , even months are eliminated with the word ''later'' . I can only think that the first part was Edge and Yount learning to do circus stuff. Also a little weird is kind of a tragedy lapsus. Somebody dies then everything gets better until the next tragedy comes. Also Jennings tried to put some sensual vibes in there will all the sex (and STDs) .

Fear not Gary's trademark debauchery is here as well as a staggering bodycount to rival his other books.
