In a way it was, but not in they way I imagined it. Plus there was the additional plot line with the serial killer, which didn\u2019t add anything to the story really, other than as filler.Plainly speaking, the writing is good but the pace is a little too slow, the book a bit too long, and there's a plot too many.There are two main plot lines which run alongside each other. One is Rick and the other is Daryl, the serial killer.Rick is a policeman, who finds his wife murdered in their home, not by zombies but by human hands. Unfortunately, she returns as a zombie. Not being able to deal with her death and zombieness, Rick decides to try and find a cure.Rick sedates her with morphine so she wouldn\u2019t bite, he discovers that by injecting the drug through her eye seems to work, and bandages her up so to others she just looks injured rather than a zombie. I could understood this reaction and could get on board with it as Rick was filled with grief. However, the author takes the reader down a route which I really didn\u2019t like. There were little hints that it was coming and I kept thinking please don\u2019t go down that route. Unfortunately the author did.Rick decides to have sex with his wife! Sex with his wife who\u2019s decaying, bloated and dead. Why the author had to go down this path I don\u2019t know but it was absolutely disgusting and made me see Rick in a completely different light. Up until that point I had been sympathetic to his plight and understood his actions, but after that I just couldn\u2019t see him any other way than a complete sicko! Honestly, what normal man, even in grief would have sex with a dead person, and not just dead, but decaying and heaving with maggots?? *shudders*The reason for the zombie outbreak is a little vague. Throughout the story people believe it's in the bite, but it seems that with some people they come back from dying without a bite, old corpses in graveyards rise up, Sally who was murdered by a human comes back as a zombie. There are suggestions the outbreak was due to human involvement, which is why Rick decides to go and look for the 'scientists' who may be able to cure his wife, but no real explanation was given. Daryl is on the cusp of becoming a serial killer. He\u2019s been stalking Sally and targets her as his first victim. We don\u2019t get to see him in action with Sally, but he does give us glimpses to his actions when he uses his memories to turn himself on. This character is vile and completely evil. His thoughts and actions are repulsive. Even when it's revealed that he was a victim of incest with his mother and bullying I felt no sympathy towards him whatsoever.The ending was a little ambiguous too - the last paragraph (not the epilogue) we see the world through Sally's eyes as a zombie, as well as her 'thoughts' and it ends on a note that suggests she is aware, but it doesn't go into any detail and just ends, which was unsatisfying.I really believe the story of Rick, his zombie wife, Sally, and their journey together could have been enough to keep me interested if the author had fleshed it out a bit, without having to include the serial killer aspect *or the vomit inducing sex scene*. It was just too much and I felt it was unnecessary.VERDICT:\u201cHungry Hearts\u201d definitely sits within the \u2018horror\u2019 genre as it is pretty horrific. There are scenes which, if you are not used to reading this kind of novel, maybe shocking to you, so you have been warned! For me there were moments which I really enjoyed and others that I really didn\u2019t \u2013 would I recommend it? Only to diehard horror fans I think."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798905-mark", "userReview": "(point of interest - I know and like Gary McMahon and have worked with him in the past)Rick Nutman is an ex-soldier, now a policeman in Leeds who is one of the first to witness a zombie uprising. Attempting to get home to his wife Sally, he is beaten there by Daryl - a young man spoiled and made psychopathic by a domineering, religious Mother - who kills her. Nutman waits for his wife to reanimate, bandages up her terrible wounds and leaves. Along the way, he meets up with Stan Rohmer and his grand-daughter Tabby, who tells him about a sanctuary, out on the Ferne Islands. Unfortunately, Daryl is now following them, wanting to kill Sally all over again. Not as melodramatic as that pr\u00e9cis would suggest, this is as gritty as we\u2019ve come to expect from McMahon, filled with a weary, bleak world-view, but willing to accept that love - in one form or another - can actually make a difference. A long book (at least 105k words) this reads quickly, with a small, well characterised cast and uses locations skilfully. Apart from Daryl and his transformation, nobody does anything that doesn\u2019t seem natural to the plot and the way each character reacts to set-pieces is beautifully conveyed. What\u2019s more, McMahon is so confident of his tale and characters, some of the broader set-pieces - the pit of zombies, to whom the unlucky Claire is introduced; the kid in the old cottage - move by so quickly you\u2019re not aware of the power you\u2019ve just read until you realise you\u2019re reeling from them. And that follows too with the darker elements of the plot - the gore is quick and brutal, but McMahon always goes for the human angle, to make the reader wince (where Sally gets injected, for instance) without becoming gratuitous or exploitative. Already a good writer, this has the feel of someone who is just realising how to spread their wings and taking delight in it and I can\u2019t wait to see what he comes up with next. And as a nice touch, McMahon peppers the book with little in-jokes - Finch and Tennant and Tim spring to mind - and homages - \u201cDawn Of The Dead\u201d - that don\u2019t detract from the books power at all. Very highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Jenevieve", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5350268-jenevieve", "userReview": "One of the Tomes of the Dead that my oldest wanted me to read. Great, the guy managed to write a zombie story without ever once using the word zombie and he takes pride in that. I call shenanigans since all he did was substitute the phrase \"walking dead\" instead. Same diff guy. But really can I just say EWWWWWW!!!!! I mean the serial killer who was finally able to realize his fantasy with the world going crazy was a big whatever. The guy who snapped and decided to keep his wife \"alive\" after the serial killer was done killing her and she was a ZOMBIE was crazy but at least sort of understandable. But when it develoved towards necrophilia that was just past the ew factor for me. The story was definitely all about the gross out factor and in that it succeeded wonderfully and I'll admit the guy wrote creepy psychopaths well but I definitely won't be running out to find more of his books to read. I will however be heading to the store to find some brain bleach."}, {"userName": "Richard Wright", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1846302-richard-wright", "userReview": "Part of Abaddon's Tomes of the Dead series, a selection of unconnected zombie novels, I think I'm right in assuming this to be McMahon's first novel, though there's more to come. I've long admired McMahon, and the bleak worldview his writing demonstrates. Hungry Hearts does not buck that trend. It's not a book for those seeking a fun, horror-flavoured romp. It's brutal, squalid, and often painful to read, a novel grounded in insanity, death, and sickness. Where much horror is ultimately about the battle between good and evil, McMahon isn't playing that familiar game. He's holding up the warts of our species and picking at them, the better to show you what you are, and that's a valuable approach. There's no redemption to be had in this novel, for the characters at least. If there's redemption to be had, it's for the reader, in recognising the thin line that separates them from what lies on the page. A brilliantly told tale, but do go in with your eyes open."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/635230-shaun", "userReview": "While the writing was nice and gruesome, the premise fell a little flat for me. The book was plot driven rather than character driven, and certain things like injecting morphine into a zombie just wouldn\u2019t work as there\u2019s no blood pumping around the body to transport the drug \u2013 and injecting it into an eyeball wouldn\u2019t make it spread either, as it would just sit wherever it was injected \u2013 and as that was a major plot point, it dragged me out of the story. Gary writes well though, and I imagine he had fun while writing this one."}, {"userName": "Elise Hattersley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4727954-elise-hattersley", "userReview": "I got this book and hoped for hilarity - instead I got a harrowing tale that had a wonderful basis but cheap execution."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5420921-john", "userReview": "One of the finest novels of this genre...a brilliant read."}], "description": "Tomes of The Dead is a collection of some of the very best eyeball popping, gut munching, zombie fiction around, groaning with horror and excitement.
