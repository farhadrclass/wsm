If one happens to like the flavor (which I do), this is not really a problem, but I admit reading a bunch in a row does the author a bit of a disservice. The basic flavor of a K/Q/C romance plot might be shorthanded as \"Beauty and the Beast\" or \"My Bodyguard\"; the heroines gradually become more kick-ass over time as the market has permitted (or demanded), but, of course, never more so than their heroes. No \u201cFreddies\u201d here, alas.The SF-nal series under the Jayne Castle penname beginning with After Dark (2000) is the more successful in terms of genre cross-over with SF than the earlier series (the eponymous Zinnia, Orchid, and Amaryllis); the later-published works are a sort of universe-reboot of the earlier. Both more or less transpose the contemporary Pacific Northwest into SF-nalized colony-planet settings with psi powers, but the series beginning with After Dark adds ancient alien abandoned cities and artifacts to the mix, much to its benefit. \u201cRomantic suspense with psi\u201d might be another thumbnail description.Of the three latest of this series I picked up from the library this past weekend to treat my reading blahs, I found one shelved in the general fiction section, one in the Romance section, and one in the SF section. (All the same series, mind you. K/Q/C readers need to be persistent and wide-ranging in their shelf searches.) She\u2019s actually done trilogies in her \u201cArcane Series\u201d with one volume as historical, the second as contemporary and the third as SF, which amuses me vastly and likely gives her publisher fits. Obsidian Prey takes place in her urban colony world setting (with alien maguffins); Canyons of Night and The Lost Night move offshore to an island in P/u/g/e/t S/o/u/n/d the Amber Sea. Castle does rather a lot of the \u201ccall a rabbit a smerp\u201d-style of SF writing, but every once in a while she slips in a real smerp.The books are probably not for the more rabid sorts of SF purists, but they did fix my reading block, as I shot through three of them in two days. Reassuring, and I would read them again sometime when I\u2019m in a similar mood, so I\u2019ll give them a 4-stars rating.Goodreads does not permit joint reviews, so I'll stick this all somewhat randomly under Canyons of Night. But I'd aim readers new to the series or author to the first \"Harmony\" novel, After Dark, for starters.Ta, L."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3954707-mara", "userReview": "I think I finally figured what my problem is with many of this author's books.

Slade Attridge had never planned to return to Rainshadow Island, but having suffered a grievous injury to his hunter talent and on the verge of psi-blindness, after a fifteen year absence he's back to play sheriff while pulling together plans for his soon to be talentless life. Having also recently returned to Rainshadow to take over her late aunt's antique shop, Charlotte is no longer the geeky young girl with a crush on the older Slade - who long ago played knight in shining armor and also took her exploring in the forbidden Preserve - but she is still captivated by Slade. Taken on it's own or as the start to the books set on Harmony's Rainshadow Island, Canyons of the Night was a cotton candy read - enjoyable, but without much substance. Both of the pair are likeable for the most part, although during the reunion that serves as our intro to our now grown up leads, Charlotte comes across a bit naggy with Slade whose dust bunny pal is on the loose around her precious antiques. But except for a minor snag on their first date, they are pretty much a done deal from the start, so their relationship just flows along to their happily ever after. Taken as the final chapter in the Looking Glass trilogy however, Canyon of the Night was pretty thin. There a few of the lethal devices make an appearance, along with a key artifact, but the wrap up to the three book saga was just plain anti-climatic with the villain popping up out of nowhere at the end, and then the classic cartoon villain pitfall leading to defeat - the monologue. Since this is the Rainshadow series starter, there are at few characters introduced and threads left hanging with respect to the mysterious Preserve. So, Canyons of Night was pleasant enough, if not all that satisfying, and I'll likely read the next one and hope for a bit more ghost hunter action the next time 'round."}, {"userName": "Jacob Proffitt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331641-jacob-proffitt", "userReview": "I don't know if it's relief that the Harmony series isn't degenerating after all or simply a better story, but I lost myself to this book and enjoyed every minute. It's not a complete win, but it was enough of one that I'm looking forward to the next one, already.I liked Charlotte from the start. She's diffident in ways that most Krentz heroines aren't and her power is subtler (to the point that people dismiss her pretty much outright). I liked how well she puts up with that and how she takes true joy in bringing the perfect gifts to the people in her life. And yes, \"rainbow auras\" is every bit as silly as dreamlight but for some reason it didn't bug me nearly as much. Maybe because it had clear rules that weren't being forever extended into the next panacea for whatever the story wanted.For his part, Slade was a bit more damaged than is typical of a Krentz hero. He's facing some career-ending blowback from a previous job and struggling to find his way to a new path in life. As at least one other character notes explicitly, however, he's got the protective thing written in his DNA, so I couldn't help attaching to him early and deeply. He was maybe a little stubborn in his self-immolation, but nothing Charlotte couldn't snap him out of.I get the sense that I should be very grateful that I skipped the whole Looking Glass Trilogy. This is the last book of it and from what I can tell I'm glad I missed the other two. What little hints we get of it sound deeply silly. You can dress it up as \"automatons\" all you like, but in the end, it's all killer dolls. Creepy, sure, but not really interesting to me.I do like the setup for Rainshadow island. That gives me some hope for the rest of the series as it looks pretty tightly bound there going forward. I hope that turns out as well as it seems from the setup, but we'll see, I suppose.So this is a solid three and a half stars throughout and it gets a rounding boost for not having any dreamlight in it. I can't wait for the next and hope it keeps up the quality.A note about Steamy: Relatively light steam, I think. Two explicit sex scenes, but the second was both short and cut to black pretty quick. I actually liked how their intimate life played out and how it had some serious back and forth."}, {"userName": "Kirsten ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten", "userReview": "I love Jayne Ann Krentz and her other aliases, Jayne Castle and Amanda Quick. However, I normally think less of the Jayne Castle books. However, this is an exception as it is an offshoot of the Arcane Society series, which I really, really like.(I'm not too fond of the cover, though, as I don't think it represents the character well.)This story takes place entirely on a quaint, exotic island.

I like the isolation motif where everything is confined to a limited area like a lonely, haunted Victorian manor or, as in this case, an island.Once again, we have psi-weapons and crystals and the odd dust bunny. Very fun."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5130775-rebecca", "userReview": "You can also read this review at Reflections on Reading RomanceI\u2019ve been a fan of Jayne Ann Krentz in her various pseudonyms ever since my Mother-in-Law shared some of her Amanda Quick books with me, and I\u2019ve really enjoyed her Paranormal Romances written under the name Jayne Castle. So I was thrilled when I saw her newest book, Canyons of Night (Book Three of the Looking Glass Trilogy), at Target last night, especially since it\u2019s not being released until Tuesday, August 30. While Canyons of Night feels a little short, it was a pleasant return to the world of Harmony and the Arcane Society.The book takes place on the island of Rainshadow and begins when three young tourists out for a ride decide to harass 15 year old Charlotte Enright. She\u2019s an awkward girl with horribly nerdy glasses, but she manages to fight off her attackers until 19 year old Slade Attridge shows up and scares them off. Charlotte has a major crush on Slade, who\u2019s the ultimate loner, and she\u2019s thrilled when he agrees to show her parts of the Rainshadow Preserves after her ordeal. The next day he leaves to join the Federal Bureau of Psi Investigation, and Charlotte vows that the next time they see each other he won\u2019t be treating her like a kid sister. Jump to fifteen years later and Slade is back on the island, as is Charlotte. Slade\u2019s burned out from his job with the FBPI and working as the island\u2019s Police Chief for 6 months until he can get his security firm up and running. Charlotte has just moved back to the island herself after inheriting her eccentric Aunt Beatrix\u2019s para-antiques store, Looking Glass Antiques. When the body of a man who was stalking Charlotte in Frequency City appears in her store, Slade senses that his death is not from natural causes and begins an investigation. In the course of the investigation, the two begin an affair and must deal with their fears about their psychic abilities while putting off a few busybody neighbors. I\u2019ve always enjoyed Ms. Krentz\u2019s writing, and it\u2019s like coming to home to read one of her books. You can count on her having likeable characters and interesting plots, and Canyons of Night is no exception to that rule. Even if you haven\u2019t read any of her other books set in the world of Harmony, you\u2019ll easily be able to follow along. However, while I very much like the book, I do feel that this is the weakest book in the Looking Glass Trilogy, mainly because it is so short. It\u2019s only 325 pages long, and you can really tell the difference between this and earlier books set in Harmony, such as my favorites After Dark and Silver Master. While the older novels may have a similar number of pages, the font is noticeably smaller and there is less space between lines, yielding more text and therefore allowing for more development of characters and plot. As for the romance between the hero and heroine, Slade is a sexy alpha male and Charlotte is one of Krentz\u2019s trademark quirky heroines. They clearly share a connection from their experience in the Rainshadow Preserves nearly 15 years ago. The two definitely set off sparks, but the romance follows the formula of Krentz\u2019s recent books. Like several of her other newer heroes, Slade\u2019s had a violent change in his psychic abilities that he fears will end in madness, while the insightful heroine manages to help him learn to accept and deal with the changes in his life. But Krentz does a good job of selling us on this formula, and I enjoyed their romance, despite hoping for more development. As in her other books, the mystery is tidily resolved, but in this particular novel I could spot the villain a mile off, which was somewhat disappointing. The resolution of the conflict between Charlotte and the villain struck me as familiar as well, reminding me of how the heroine in Fired Up! , the first book in the trilogy, manages to extract herself from dangerous situations. Another niggling complaint has to do with the title of the book, Canyons of Night. The phrase refers to a term that Slade uses to describe the lakes in the mysterious Rainshadow Preserves. I\u2019m a bit conflicted about the use of the Preserves in the book, because they\u2019re featured prominently in the story but our questions about them are never answered. I\u2019m not sure why this was chosen as the title, since the actual mystery in the text doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the Preserves. Several different characters venture into the forest at times and much is made of the fact that most who enter never return or return forever changed. However, the answers to the mystery of the Preserves is clearly intended for a future book. That we never learn about the danger that is clearly developing within the Preserves is a bit of a let-down. All in all, I enjoyed returning to the world of Harmony and the Arcane Society, especially since we get to meet a new dustbunny, Rex, who likes to carry around an antique beaded clutch he stole from Charlotte\u2019s store. Reading Canyons of Night is like catching up with an old friend, but I would have liked to see more development of Charlotte and Slade\u2019s characters. They\u2019re likeable but, because of the length of the novel and the somewhat formulaic nature of their romance, easily forgettable."}, {"userName": "boogenhagen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3794921-boogenhagen", "userReview": "I only read these for the dust bunnies!

Unfortunately, it all fell apart with the ending for me -- the typical hero/heroine in peril, escape from said peril because of really contrived circumstances (in this case, Charlotte's psychic sense that Slade is in trouble, even though no-where else is there any indication that she has powers of that sort), et cetera, et cetera.I think it only really bothered me because I found the light-hearted, character-based beginning very charming and for it to jump in tone from enjoyable romance to middling suspense was a disappointment. Not a surprise, JAK has been disappointing me in that way for years and I keep reading her, but still... it didn't end on a high note for me.Also, the cover art makes no sense. I know, it's cover art and cover art never makes sense, but you'd think with an author who sells as much as JAK does, the publisher could make an effort."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3155867-rachel", "userReview": "I hate to say anything negative about a book, I really do. Even if I couldn't stand it or couldn't finish it (or both), I just don't like to say anything bad about it, at least in print. The way I see it, this author plus all the people who got this book ready for the market put in a lot of time, effort, and hard work. And yet...and yet...I've been reading Jayne Castle's (aka Jayne Ann Krentz, aka Amanda Quick) Harmony series for years and years. I think reading any new editions has just become habit. So here's the gist: some time in our (us real people) future and a few centuries in the character's past, some kind of cosmic door opened between Earth and another planet and we earthlings, being intrepid adventurers that we are, went through it. All was fine, until said cosmic door closed, and suddenly everything the earth-folk brought with them (computers, electronics, and such) stopped working. They created a primitive type society, working to stabilize the population, all next to a green (and long empty) alien city. The city couldn't be inhabited because...well...weird alien stuff. Jump to the character's present, and former-earthlings have since developed various psychic abilities enabling them to cope in their new environment, they're back up to speed with technology, and at least one protagonist will have a \"pet\" dust bunny - a dust bunny that has four eyes and likes to viciously attack anyone who threatens their humans.So, I could tell you about this novel, but as so often happens with long-running series, it's exactly like every other book in the series. Ugh. The main differences here are that instead of taking place in one of the main cities, this story takes place on an island, and instead of the hero and heroine going underground into the strange, green, alien city, there's some kind of wonky nature preserve that people go in, but never return. Oh, and as the series goes on, each hero and heroine has bigger, badder powers and faces bigger, badder dangers. But everything else? EXACTLY THE SAME.Once upon a time, I really liked these books. The first few times. It was new and interesting; now it's old and stale. It also ties in to Krentz's Arcane novels. I've never read any of those, so I don't know how they stack up, but I probably will never attempt to find out. And yet I keep reading this series as new titles are published. Maybe I'm a masochist. I don't know.I'd suggest one of the first few titles in this series if you like a bit of sci-fi mixed in with your romance, or romance mixed in with your sci-fi, but stop there.

This story moves to the planet of Harmony and takes place on the island of Rainshadow. It is a small isolated island. Charlotte spent part of her childhood there with her aunt and now has returned to take over her aunt's antique store. Charlotte has a little-regarded psychic gift of being a rainbow reader. She can see people's auras and can tune some antiques to be just the right thing for a person. She has also recently inherited some things from a grateful client. She is busy organizing her aunt's shop and getting settled in on Rainshadow.Slade Attridge has returned to Rainshadow to be the new chief of police. He has been forced to leave his higher profile career in law enforcement after an accident that the doctors and para-psychologists have said damaged his psychic gift beyond repair. Slade is determined to only stay on Rainshadow for a brief time while he makes other plans for his life.Charlotte and Slade had met briefly fifteen years before and had been interested in each other but their lives led them in different directions. Now, the romance is rekindled. Slade is reluctant to make any sort of commitment to Charlotte, though, because of his very uncertain future. But, when Charlotte finds a dead body in her store, Slade's plans to lie low until he has has new life plans in place is derailed. Charlotte may be in danger and Slade's protective instincts come to the fore. They are both busy trying to find out who killed Charlotte's intruder and also what is going on in the Preserve. This privately owned area is changing and becoming more frightening and dangerous. Adding a lot of humor to the suspense and romance is Slade's dust bunny partner Rex. Dust bunnies are native to Harmony and occasionally adopt some of the humans. Rex looks cute and fluffy most of the time but he is a dangerous predator is there is a threat. Rex also loves zucchini bread which is a constant thread in this book since zucchini season has hit and one of the locals is constantly giving everyone loaves of it. He also has taken a fancy to an antique beaded evening bag from Charlotte's store and won't be parted from it. This one has all the elements of the most successful of Jayne Castle's books. It has romance. It has danger. It has cute dust bunnies. And it has crisp, snappy dialog. All in all, it was a very satisfying read, a great conclusion to the Looking Glass trilogy, and a great introduction to stories about the Preserve and Rainshadow.My only quibble with the story concerns the cover. I have no idea who the cover is supposed to illustrate. Charlotte is not the kind to go around in tight leather.

Now a number of mysterious break-ins and a dead body in her shop has Charlotte coming to Slade for help once again. Series note:This is the 3rd book in the Looking Glass trilogy, and the 12th and final book in the Arcane Society series. Nevertheless, it is also book #8 in the Harmony series and the prequel to the Rainshadow series, both of which are ongoing (yes, it is as confusing as it seems).Although set in the future and on a different planet, Canyons of Night is more contemporary romantic suspense that science-fiction. The basic plot follows the same formula as the other installments in the Arcane series and the romance is lukewarm. Nevertheless, there is something about Castle (aka Krentz\u2019s) writing that makes her works eminently readable. Although their chemistry isn\u2019t that spectacular, Charlotte and Slade are very relatable both as individuals and as a couple. The mystery has potential, but is under-developed with little to no new information on Mrs. Brightwell\u2019s clockwork curiosities and a villain who comes out of nowhere. That said, the enigmatic nature of the area of Rainshadow known as The Preserve is very compelling and the hints at something mystifying and perhaps even nefarious going on are enough to convince me to read the on.All in all, this is a solid conclusion to the Arcane Society series, and I'm looking forward to reading more about Rainshadow Island."}, {"userName": "Barbara \u2605", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968285-barbara", "userReview": "What can I say...I love Jayne Castle (Jayne Ann Krentz, Amanda Quick)!

He is the perfect man for Charlotte Enright. His psychic abilities mesh completely with hers making for a perfect match. I particularly liked Rex, the dust bunny with 6 legs, 4 eyes and a mouthful of sharp teeth. He provided the needed comic relief. I loved him and his clutch purse. He carried that thing everywhere and put little trinkets in it. Just too damn cute. Charlotte Enright owns the local antique store on Rainshadow Island and uses her psychic gifts to enchance the items for specific clients.

Charlotte and Slade play detective to ferret out who killed him and why. There really isn't much suspense but the sparks between Charlotte and Slade are intense.

That's more important than ever with \"Canyons of Night\" because although it never feels forced, there's a lot of new information in the book, setting the scene for a spin-off sub-series.The characters are well-established and likeable. The trope of meeting your teenage crush later in life works for me. Enjoyable and pleasantly re-readable."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2999717-jacqueline", "userReview": "Another comfort read from JAK. This is a spin off story set on Harmony. He is a hunter and she has a powerful version of a skill that everyone believes is pretty useless. Of course it comes into play to save the day at the end as usual. There are continuing shenanigans concerning the Old Earth evil magic items which are the centerpieces of the Looking Glass trilogy which we are now finding out have been taken beyond the curtain by the original settlers.The romance is low key as is usual in JAK's stories. If you've read her other stuff this is more of the same. Good writing and paranormal abilities and dust bunnies with a bit of romance. If you haven't read the others, I don't think you should start here as some of it could be confusing if you didn't know the world."}, {"userName": "Harriet", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/413731-harriet", "userReview": "Dust bunnies rule! I want my own! Rex is an awesome metrosexual dust bunny; I would've liked to know a little bit more about whether he had a girlfriend that he was bringing treasures in his little clutch. :)Of the three installments, I liked this one best - Slade and Charlotte's relationship, while quickly progressing - seemed more realistic. Slade isn't overwhelming all about his soul mate, as some of the author's heroes. The ending was very tidy and unsurprising, which is perhaps why I liked how this book was more about the couple than the artifacts and Arcane."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3252002-donna", "userReview": "I did really like this, but it was only a 4-star for me because it seemed to lack the intensity of many of her other books. I liked both Slade and Charlotte a lot and liked the way they were drawn back to Rainshadow and each other. I also loved Devin and his story. I just felt the romance was a little shallow, I didn't feel any sexual tension. The conflict/mystery/bad guys was also kind of flat. Overall, this was a enjoyable addition to the Harmony/Arcane series, but not one of my favorites."}, {"userName": "Dee Sauter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5657402-dee-sauter", "userReview": "First off Jayne Castle/Amanda Quick/Jayne Ann Krentz has a tendency to be very confusing. It is almost impossible to follow any kind of trilogy because she keeps changing her name. That is soooo frustrating! Each one of the trilogies are under a different name. Of the three this one is the best.

With no explanation? That was a bit much. I really liked Rex the dust bunny, though. And his/her clutch purse.Addendum: The more I think about this book the more it annoys me. I don't know if it holds true for all of the books in the Harmony series, but it's definitely not up to the quality of the other Arcane Society novels. It only fits in peripherally and the characters aren't nearly as well developed as those in the other Arcane Society novels. Normally I'm not into the \u00fcber-Alpha male books, but those had brainy stubborn, kick-ass female counterparts that were their equals. These characters felt lukewarm. It could be that I haven't read the other Harmony books, to be fair, but given this one, I don't really want to. For someone reading this one who hasn't read the other Arcane Society books, I would recommend the historical ones especially, even though there are some minor inaccuracies with language occasionally that are a little jarring. I don't read contemporaries as much but I liked those okay as well (I was checking them out from the library and they were missing a couple of the contemporaries)."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7266435-rebecca", "userReview": "[What was the key her 'aunt'? was looking for??
