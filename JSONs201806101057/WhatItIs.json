For those that were left wanting to know what happened to the little girl who was abused in the first story - this is Sarah's answer. She talks about how she got away from her abusive mother and how she was able to build a life for herself. It is good to know that in spite of her abuse and likely HUGE odds of leading a very dysfunctional life, Sarah was able to find some WONDERFUL people to help her grow and become the successful and \"normal\" person she is today. I am really thankful that she shared her story, and again - I hope that people will read this and that it can help. We can't just bury our heads in the sand when we think someone is being abused. I don't know why more people don't want to be involved in helping our innocent children. And, even if we are wrong - isn't it better to err on the side of the safety and well being of a child than to allow the abuse to continue and pretend that we didn't see anything? The more we tolerate abuse, the more children will be tortured and destroyed. How can this ever be OK?"}, {"userName": "Loni", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1588261-loni", "userReview": "This book was absolutely amazing. I couldn\u2019t put it down and read it in just over a day. This book truly shows how strong a person can be no matter what they are put through. Sarah lived through hell at the hands of her mother but was able to turn all of her experiences into something that made her a stronger person and I am sure, a much better mother. Sarah proves that no matter how tough life is, regardless of situation, we are able to overcome the most unbelievable circumstances. I actually read this book before reading Why Me, but I am going to purchase that book right now, as I cannot wait to read it."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38140-john", "userReview": "Grabbed it from the Kindle store and wasn't sure what it was.

I was never abused by my parents! But I was abused by others. I have been going through therapy for over 20 years. I just wish I could be that strong! I am in the best relationship U have ever been in, I have 2 wonderful sons and a wonderful step-daughter and grandson. I have a wonderful relationship with God!

It is unfathomable how a mother could do this to her child. It makes me so sad and angry that CPS, who is supposed to protect children fail miserably time after time. If CPS won't protect these children, who will?? I felt an even more emotional response to this story after the birth of her son who has the same birthday as my daughter 2/2/07. I commend Sarah and all the abuse victims who tell their stories not only as part of their own healing process but to try to help others who are experiencing this.

Instead of continually wondering why her mother treated her as she did, Sarah came to accept her childhood for what it was - one fraught with child abuse, a past she could not change - and rose above the circumstances so she could truly embrace a family of her own.I had the privilege of meeting Sarah and her family in 2011 and can truly say she's a wonderful person to be around.

I'm glad to see this follow up answered all of them. Although I still struggled to emotionally attach, I was far more drawn into this one than the first. The largest appeal to What it Is is the fact the trauma of abuse permeates so many factors of life, even after the abuse ends, that in many ways you never truly get past it; you merely learn to cope with it and eventually overcome many obstacles. This book demonstrates clearly the irrational fears and self blame that haunt a victim for years and that alone makes it well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5060267-christy", "userReview": "A sad, but amazing story of a young woman who was able to survive and overcome severe, escalating abuse from the one person who was supposed to love and protect her - her Mother. \"What It Is\" goes hand and hand to \"Why Me.\" It is here in \"What It Is\" that Sarah tells us more of her story. It is a miracle that she survived and I am so happy for her that she turned out to be such a beautiful and strong woman. Sadly, there are victims of abuse all over the world.

One could feel the pain she felt as she continuously tries to convince the readers (and herself) that she has put this all behind her.
