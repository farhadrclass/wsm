Immediately the book's name piqued my interest because there are fewer smells in this world that I love more than salt air. I then realized it is written by Barbara Delinsky and I was excited as I'd read other books of hers in the past and enjoyed them. When I then read the synopsis and saw that it was set in my beloved Maine I couldn't wait for the release date! I was super stoked when I saw this book in my offerings for Amazon Vine and jumped at the chance to read it before it came out. Sweet Salt Air takes place on a small island in Maine (sadly I believe it is fictitious) where two friends come together for the first time in many years for a summer. Together they write a cookbook while sorting through the house and getting it ready for sale. Each friend is in a different place in life - Nicole is hiding a secret about her husband while putting a brave face on for the world to see while Charlotte is a freelance writer traveling the world but has a secret she's kept from Nicole since their last summer on the island. I was expecting your usual fluffy beach read but I should have known to know more was to come from Ms Delinsky and she didn't disappoint. She brought Maine to life quite vividly and captured the essence of what I adore about that state. The prominent relationship in the book, the friendship between Nicole and Charlotte was well written and I enjoyed the journey with them. I had a feeling how the book would end up but I still was pleasantly surprised by a few things and especially enjoyed the romance side of the story. Finally I congratulate the author for NOT including recipes. I don't know why all of the sudden authors keep adding in recipes whenever food is involved but for some reason it isn't my cup of tea so I liked that this novel talks about food and recipes but didn't include a bagillion (or even one) of them. Overall I enjoyed my stay on Quinnipeague and think that many others will as well."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "This was not quite as good as I was hoping, and I love Delinsky but felt a bit let down. Two childhood friends reunite, secrets kept, secrets revealed, love kept, love found, dilemma's and near tragedies......but in the end all is well and everyone lives happily ever after! Just a bit too predictable and flat for me. Another problem is that I really did not care much for half of the main characters (Nicole and Julian) so their part of the story didn't grab me emotionally. I will say though, I loved the description of the island.....of it's lifestyle, it's people and it's FOOD! Oh my, I gained weight just reading this book and wished that the cookbook were real. It made me want to put the book down and pull down some pots and pans! She does a wonderful job creating the sights, sounds and smells of coastal life. She also describes her characters very well....the looks, the voices, the mannerisms. I would recommend this when in the mood for a women's book.....some friendship issues, family matters and romance.......and of course for food!

I for one was not wowed. Maybe I am too tainted from reading better books but the characters get under a reader's skin and are really annoying. So many times I wanted to scream \u2013 \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d.Nicole, one of the main characters, is incredibly whiny & immature. Someone needed to tell her to grow a backbone. Her husband, Julian, who is diagnosed with MS and for the past 4 years tells no one except his wife \u2013 oh that\u2019s realistic. Then we have the best friend Charlotte who has a secret that she should have kept to herself. Most of the book is occupied with Nicole crying about her husband and \u201cpoor me\u201d how am I ever going to get this cookbook finished. Good thing she had a friend like Charlotte.On top of the characters the book rams the island stuff down your throat. It\u2019s all a little much. But like so many authors Ms Delinsky raps the story up happily in the epilogue \u2013 how very nice!

It was exactly what I was looking for at this point. Best friends Charlotte and Nicole start working on a cookbook capturing all the local herbs and recipes of their youth. Charlotte comes back to stay with Nicole of the island of Quinniepeague to help spur this project. She brings with her secrets from the past and provides the solace and comfort that Nicole desperately needs. Nicole's husband Julian has MS, and undergoes multiple treatment options while the friends are working on the cookbook. Everything gets tied back to the history of the island and the secrets that lie within Cecily Cole's herb garden.I would highly recommend this one for a great summer read.

Needless to say there are tons of yummy issues!My thoughts after reading...I can't even remotely write or say anything \"bad\" about this book. Reading a book by Barbara Delinsky is like going home for me. Her books are just yummy, relaxing, and have just the right amount of dysfunction and secrets...and in this book...amazing food descriptions!The location for this book is also a place I cherish...Maine...and her descriptions of the people, the food, the coast, the berries...EVERYTHING...are so spot on we booked a trip in August. Ok...first of all I love and adore Leo and his dog Bear...his relationship with Charlotte has the kind of romantic spark that is filled with...hmmm...let's just say intensity...that is to die for in a book...sexy without being graphic. Ms. Delinsky captured my reading soul in this book. I was NEVER bored...I was always anticipating each character's next move...I adored this book.Let's just say that if you were on the beach reading Sweet Salt Air...you would miss lunch and a snack and most likely have a terrible sunburn because time would fly by so quickly.Lest I forget...just a quick briefing of the story...Charlotte and Nicole reunite on their island to write a cookbook. Nicole's doctor husband has a secret that Nicole has kept for 4 years...Charlotte has a secret that could help Nicole's husband but kill her renewed relationship with Nicole. Leo is an island enigma and Charlotte is drawn to him...and of course...everything clashes! Yum!What I loved about this book...In a word...EVERYTHING!What I did not love...Nicole was my least favorite character...she had spoiled brat only child syndrome...but that just added to the allure of this book.Final thoughts...Readers who are familiar with this author's work will be delighted with this book.

Nicole and Charlotte who had been friends since grade school and who hadn\u2019t seen each other for ten years had secrets they couldn\u2019t tell each other. Nicole\u2019s secret did come out, but it was good that it did. Charlotte\u2019s secret was definitely better left unrevealed.Sweet Salt Air is set in Quinnipeague, an island filled with quaint citizens and great cooks with wonderful recipes for Nicole\u2019s cookbook and Charlotte\u2019s accompanying narratives. The island\u2019s characters were diverse and filled with generations of families who lived and worked using their talents in many areas, but specifically cooking and baking. They also knew everyone\u2019s personal business, and if they didn\u2019t, they would make it their business to find out. Everyone on the island was family.The description of the island was heavenly and sounded like a perfect place for a vacation even though some Quinnies were not pleased with outsiders. What brought the entire book together was the characters. The storyline fell into place around them more than the storyline falling around the characters. Leo, the son of the town\u2019s herbal genius, was quite odd, but very likable. Charlotte and Nicole shared a friendship that was good for both of them. Julian, Nicole\u2019s husband, was an ok character, but you will find out why he was the way he was when you delve into this appealing book.I enjoyed the book because of the beach setting, the wonderful, homey town, Ms. Delinsky\u2019s writing, and of course the recipe hints. Warning: Don't read this book while you are hungry. I have never read a Barbara Delinsky book before and truly enjoyed SWEET SALT AIR. This book is a dream for all readers. It has books, bloggers, authors and is set in a beautiful location with appealing, unique characters. It is about life's choices and decisions, families, triumphs, and tragedies, along with a love story thrown in. It is a quick, delightful and VERY engaging book. 5/5This book was given to me free of charge by the publisher without compensation in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jann Barber", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2107952-jann-barber", "userReview": "A friend won copies of the Advance Readers' Edition of this book, as it is not going on sale until June.When I started it, I thought, \"Oh, this is not really something I enjoy,\" and I did skim some of the first chapters.

Both successful in their lives, but the similarity ends there. Charlotte lives her life on the go. A travel writer, she thrives on living out of a suitcase. Rarely content to be in one place too long, she is always looking ahead to the next location. Nicole, is the polar opposite. Married to a famous neonatal surgeon, she authors a food blog that centers mainly on the farm to table movement. She lives her life between Philadelphia and the Maine island of Quinnipeague. Both women appear to live an idyllic existence. But both women have issues that mar their seemingly perfect lives. Both have secrets that bubble beneath the surface, looking for a tiny opening to break through the surface. Brought together for the summer to work on an island cookbook,Charlotte and Nicole have a unique opportunity to rekindle their friendship if only they can work past the baggage that weigh them down. I enjoyed the characters and their accompanying drama. Nicole came off as a whiny entitled so and so at times, but there was a good balance of personalities.The secondary characters were wonderful and easy to relate to. This would be an awesome summer beach read, or in my case a welcome diversion to tedious hours driving across four states. I listened to the audio edition and totally enjoyed it. The narrator gave life to the characters and nailed the unique accent of the islanders. I have a weakness for food based fiction and this one did not disappoint. Mouth watering descriptions along with the tantalizing smells of the herbs and flowers of the island made me want to book a trip.

When I read the description of what the book was about I was expecting a great summer read about two friends sharing their summer at a beach house in Maine.

I was disappointed however, and found the book and story to be very surface level and not engaging at all.

The predictable love story, but with very nice twists throughout. Easy reading, nice flow throughout the story. Delinsky choosing a hard subject to write about - MS - kept it cutting edge with her information on stem cell treatment. This book delved into the complexities of friendship, and how it changes over time, the change often taking on a life of its own. The stress of being hurt by a close friend, with the outcome of forgiveness. It also covered the differences in love and the individual way in which each couple fits together having a shared union, elusive to all others.Between the two main couples I favored Charlotte and Leo. They became more real to me - a more humble couple. I understood their problems and wished all through the story for their success. I loved the imagery of Cecily. Cecily brought a lot to the story, in my opinion. Julian and Nicole were too rigid - too elite - to relate to. Even with Julian's MS, he and Nicole took second place in the story. Nicole came across as a spoiled child and an unapproachable adult - too full of herself and blind to the real problems of her mother, Charlotte, Leo, or the world. Her only redeeming quality was the suffering she went through not being able to discuss Julian's health problems. Julian was an ass and never redeemed himself in my eyes. The island was wonderful and someplace that you wished that you were also a life long resident and could be enfolded into the protection of those invisible boundaries. When you pick up a Delinsky book you know what to expect and this one did not fail.

I was excited to receive this book, and to start reading it...I have read many of her books and liked them. I appreciate all the hard work that authors put into writing books, and realize they can't please me every time they write a new book. There were many who gave this book 5 star reviews. However, that being said, I have mixed feeling about this book. There were parts I liked, but other parts I didn't like at all.It started off as a slow read for me until about page 150 where the pace picked up somewhat, but it wasn't a page turner for me either. Sometimes it was a struggle for me to continue to read. I just couldn't connect with the two women, Nicole and Charlotte. I don't know what it was about them, but they tended to get on my nerves. Especially Nicole! Her doctor husband has MS, and all she can think of is herself and how she suffered for four years because he didn't want her to tell anyone about it. Well, I can understand his feelings about that! Oh well, this wasn't real life it was just a novel written to entertain.I think Ms. Delinsky has me spoiled, and I guess I expected more than Chick-lit and PG romance, which in my small mind, is what I classed this novel as. I do have my favorite Chick-lit and romance authors so have nothing against fluffy novels. I just wasn't expecting it when I started to read this book.

I know that Ms. Delinsky is loved by many readers, and I wanted to love her also. I read Sweet Salt Air with an opened mind and heart. I do not wish to offend anyone, but this book is not my cup of tea, did not float my boat, nor did it tickle my fancy. By now you are probably screaming, \"Stop with the corny cliches\"! Okay, I will not write any more of them.I found this story to be very contrived and predictable. The book is 400 pages long, and yet there is little true character development. I found the characters to be very one dimensional and self serving. I always thought that writers had a wonderful command of the English language, and they are able to find musical and enchanting ways to express their characters thoughts and feeling. I was disappointed that Ms. Delinsky's prose is full of corny cliches to express her characters deepest thoughts. Are all her books written in this style?I have a few friends who have MS, so I am familiar with it's ups and downs. I was hoping for an insightful read on this terrible disease. Again, I found the Ms. Delinsky did not give her character enough depth or emotion, nor did she explain enough about MS to have her reader truly understand just how debilitating this disease can be.

Nicole is wife to her Philadelphia-based neonatal-surgeon husband as well as a farm-to-table food blogger with a massive following. When Nicole is faced with the task of returning to Quinnipeague to prepare her family's summer home for sale after her father's death, she invites Charlotte to stay with her. With hopes of repairing their friendship and collaborating on a cookbook, Nicole is expecting a summer filled with closure and immortalizing local Quinnipeague herbs and recipes. But each of the women have a secret that the other doesn't know. Secrets that are devastatingly linked and exposed upon the women's reunion.

A marriage stressed by illness and more secrets. A brooding mysterious man with secrets of his own. A beautiful Maine setting.Charlotte and Nicole grew up together, close as sisters. As adults, their lives have taken different roads. Charlotte is single, a writer who travels the worlds for her stories. Nicole has achieved success of her own as a food blogger. She is married to a rising star physician. They reunite at Nicole's family home on an island off the coast of Maine to collaborate on a cookbook on island food. The island, Quinnipeague, offers a beautiful setting and its own cast of quirky character including Leo, a secretive somewhat reclusive man. Secrets emerge, relationships change, and by the end things come together.This book has all the makings of a fun, easy summer beach read. Unfortunately, for me, it was not. For one, I guessed the big life changing secret early on in the book, and from there, it becomes too predictable. Predictability in and of itself is not so bad, but I also find myself not engaged with the characters. The best part of the book for me is the beautiful Maine setting."}, {"userName": "Maria Ulery", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7468286-maria-ulery", "userReview": "I won this book as my first Ms. Delinsky book and my first good reads giveaway and wow what a winning combo. I loved the story, the characters and everything in between. Nicole invites her bff to Quinnapeg Maine where her parents have a beach house. Her dad has just passed away and her mom is going to be selling it soon and this is there chanc for one last summer together even thou they havent seen each other in 10 yrs Nicole wants to see her and needs her friend Charlotte the author of many famed articles written all over the world to help her with her cookbook that is due to the publisher in Aug. Charlotte heads to Maine but is harboring a deep secret she wants to tell Nicole but cant for fear it will ruin their childhood friendship. The island brings many characters that Barbara brings to life one being Nicole's hubby Julian who has an ill fated disease. This hit me hard b/c I myself have a disease, lupus, and have a very close friend that has the same disease as Julian so i couldnt put the book down and loved every minute of it. I will be reading more Barbara Delinsky and thanks to her and St Martins Press and goodreads for letting me win this book. once it comes out i will do an amazon and Barnes and nobles 5* review also.A great book highly recommended 5*!"}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "I did not enjoy this book as purchased on audio and the narrator had a grinding voice which turned me off. (if not a good narrator, then it can ruin a book). Liked the setting and the story, but thought a little slow and was not one of those books you cannot put down.

This was my first novel by Barbara Delinsky. From the moment I set eyes on the title and the cover, I knew I just HAD to get it. I always loved the sea and its salty smell, and there was no way I could resist that title. It was one of those books you feel like you've been dreaming about for a long time. And I loved it, from beggining to end. The character I liked best was Charlotte, though I can\u00b4t say there was a single character I didn\u00b4t like. Nicole was cute and charming, Leo was lovely and a gripping sort of character that left you hooked.The beggining just engrossed me...two friends, a betrayal, secrets and 10 years apart. And then the struggle of both: Charlotte with Leo and her betrayal, Nicole with Julian and his MS. And their stories were so well woven in each other that it wasn\u00b4t tiresome. I liked Bob's phrases, and Angie was a perfect mother.The MS plot clearly shows a good research. And everything was just so real that I felt as if I\u00b4d met the characters myself, their feelings...Barabara Delinsky just hit the sky this time. What about the setting? I loved the descriptions of Quinniepeague and the beach- it actually made me smell the \"Sweet Salt Air\". I will definitly take this book to the beach this summer. On top of all, it was easy to read-I read it in three evenings. The ending was happy and satisfying.I shall check out more books by this author, but I don\u00b4t belive there can be anything in the whole wide world better than this. So,read it,you won\u00b4t regret it!"}, {"userName": "Donna Antaramian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1702733-donna-antaramian", "userReview": "At one time Nicole and Charlotte we best of friend \u2013 inseparable \u2013 spending their summers on Nicole\u2019s family summer home on Quinnipeague, a small island off the coast of Maine. But 10 years have passed, with secrets kept and different life paths that have caused these women to grow apart. Nicole\u2019s dad has passed away and now the summer home on Quinnipeague is going to be sold. Nicole being a food blogger and Charlotte a successful travel writer will bring these 2 friends together once more to renew their friendship and write a cookbook bases on Quinnipeague recipes \u2013 but each has a secret that will change both their lives. Nicole\u2019s secret would betray her husband, Julian\u2019s wishes, for Charlotte it could destroy her renewed friendship with Nicole but prolong Julian\u2019s life. It would release Charlotte from her guilt of the past and allow her to love again. Sweet Salt Air by Barbara Delinsky it a story of the strength of friendship, the ability to face misfortune, to love again and follow your heart when your life does not follow your life plan.I can\u2019t say the story was unpredictable. I did find Nicole\u2019s character at time be grating but total enjoyed Charlotte and Leo. This was my first Barbara Delinsky book - it was well written, I found the characters well developed - I will definitely read another Delinsky. This was an audiobook was narrated by Marguerite Gavin \u2013 she did an excellent job."}], "description": "Charlotte and Nicole were once the best of friends, spending summers together in Nicole's family's island house, but they have since grown apart.
