Not only is it heavy on the romance and low on the fantasy, but it is also painfully boring.The first 50% of this book is almost solely made up of Raisa copying symbols down or crushing on Prince Mati. The romance is so dry and uninteresting. Raisa's crush is clear from the very first chapter (it already exists prior to the novel's timeline so there's no build or tension) when she blushes every time Mati breathes:\nMati also didn\u2019t have the rather unfair disadvantage of having to study next to himself. Realizing how close we sat on the bench, I scooted away from him and swung my hair forward to hide my blush.\nPerhaps a more skilled romance author might drag this out into something thrilling - will they/won't they? - but here it is as simple as Raisa having a crush, which is then reciprocated a couple of chapters later. Cue repetitive making out scenes.I suppose world-building might come later, after the 50% point, but in those pages I read, it was like the Raisa/Mati plot existed in a vacuum. There were some mentions of scrolls and slaves, but that is far from the story's focus. And while some might find it unfair to criticize a book's plot without actually finishing it, I'm of the opinion that some kind of interesting story should have formed by the halfway point.Raisa's narrative is so indistinct and forgettable. I have no doubt I will have forgotten all about her by tomorrow. In fact, all the characters blended together in a stream of boredom. Just so... bland.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "DNF at 40%This book wasn't overwhelmingly romantic. The main character wasn't overwhelmingly stupid. I guess the word \"overwhelming\" is the key here, because it's what this book wasn't. It was completely underwhelming and mind-numbingly boring, and I think that's reason enough for my rating. I didn't enjoy it. It was about a slave girl who's chosen for some reason to be a royal tutor, and all of a sudden the prince falls in love with her. Like wtf? I don't even know what happened. All of a sudden around the 20% mark, they started kissing, leaving me scratching my head because damn, that escalated quickly.I mean, if a minor resistance plot, a dreamy romance, and reading about learning to read and write floats your boat, good for you.

Despite her young age, her father was teaching her to read and write, grooming her to take his place as a Learned One. In Qilara, the Arnathim, like Raisa, are the lowest class, and literacy is a capital offense. What\u2019s more, only the king, prince, tutor, and tutor-in-training are allowed to learn the very highest order language, the language of the gods. So when the tutor-in-training is executed for teaching slaves this sacred language, and Raisa is selected to replace her, Raisa knows any slipup on her part could mean death.Keeping her secret is hard enough, but the romance that\u2019s been growing between her and Prince Mati isn\u2019t helping matters. Then Raisa is approached by the Resistance\u2014an underground army of slave rebels\u2014to help liberate Arnath slaves. She wants to free her people, but that would mean aiding a war against Mati. As Raisa struggles with what to do, she discovers a secret that the Qilarites have been hiding for centuries\u2014one that, if uncovered, could bring the kingdom to its knees.What I Liked:Sword and Verse was one of those books that I knew I would enjoy, upon reading only the synopsis. I remember seeing the title, and then the synopsis, and then the cover... I remember discovering that the author was a fellow Baltimorean, which is REALLY exciting. Of all of Harper's 2016 Winter and Spring debuts, Sword and Verse was the one I wanted to read the most. You probably already saw my top five reasons why I think you should read this book, but this will be a more in-depth and coherent log of my thoughts on the book - which was superb!Note: I will not do this book justice, with this review. I couldn't do it with my Top Five Reasons post (which you should check out, it's slightly more condensed), and I know I can't do it here. There are some books that are that great that I just want to say, \"TRUST ME AND READ IT!\" and be done with the review. Still, I hope I can write a nice review (and not spoil things).As a child, Raisa was chosen to be the next tutor, and so she began to learn to read and write alongside the crown prince of Qilara, Mati. Years later, Raisa's feelings for Mati have grown, and she has also become a very accomplished Tutor, mastering the language and symbols with ease. Raisa and Mati know they shouldn't feel anything towards each other... but they do. When war breaks out against Qilara, Raisa will help the Resistance or stay loyal to Qilara - there is no easy way out of her past, present, or future.This book is written from Raisa's POV, and it starts in the past, when Raisa is small. She wasn't always a distinguished tutor-in-training - she used to be a slave in the kingdom. As an Arnath child, she never felt welcome in Qilara anyway. Raisa is a different heroine from what we typically see in YA fantasy these days. She isn't bent on saving the world, or wielding swords, or defying royalty. She's loyal to Mati, and she doesn't forget her people, but she doesn't want to necessarily help the Resistance when it could mean hurting Mati (indirectly). Raisa is a mentally and emotionally strong young woman, which is just as important as being physically tough. She is intelligent and kind, and has to work through an incredible amount of emotional burden throughout the book.Mati is the male protagonist of the book, and a very important character in the story. He has to lead Qilara for various reasons, and the learning curve is steep. He never wanted to be a part of the conflict and war that Qilara is deeply entrenched in, but he takes steps to ensure Qilara's success. Mati is selfless and clever, which is one of the reasons why I think him and Raisa are a great pair.So much of this book revolves around language and writing and symbols. The Resistance is desperate to have Raisa helping them because she can read and write, and she is in the palace. Raisa's role as Tutor will be to teach Mati's children how to read and write, as well as train the next Tutor. So you see that Raisa and Mati's roles were clearly defined from that start... but it didn't stop either of them from falling for each from the start. We know that Raisa has feelings for Mati since she was little, and we find out that he has feelings for her too. The romance is a strange one; no love triangle, but it isn't like any romance I've read. There was a point in the book that broke my heart, and it was less than halfway through. This book takes place over a year (maybe a little over a year?), not including the prologue. A LOT happens during that time, in terms of the romance (and in terms of the entire story). This book is a fantasy novel through and through, so there are certain elements of the story that intersect with the romance that really only occur in fantasy novels... you'll have to read the book to know what I mean, but the romance in this book is very unconventional. And I say all of that and mean it in a GOOD way. I absolutely love how MacMillan constructed the romance, how it developed. The romance wraps up in a satisfying way, and there is no love triangle. NO LOVE TRIANGLE. None. The romance is one of my favorite aspects of this book. So. Good. Lots of swoon and fangirling from me, I will assure you.MacMillan also does a great job with the world-building. Sometimes high fantasy novels seem to blur together, in terms of the worlds. I didn't find it the case with this book; the emphasis on language and symbols made this book highly distinctive, as well as the structure of the court and kingdom, and the role of religion. The ending is stunning, in my opinion. The book takes it time for the most part, in terms of pacing, but the climax picks up speed and the ending is eye-opening. I love the pacing of the book overall, and I really liked how the ending felt. Everything comes together, and the ending wraps up all the loose threads. I was really happy with the ending, especially in the last few pages. This book is a standalone, and the ending is perfect for it. It's not as tightly wrapped as I would have hoped (there are one or two things that I thought were open-ended), but I have it on good authority that things will be addressed in the future - but not as a series. So. Standalone for the win!What I Did Not Like:This book was really satisfying for me, so I don't think I have complaints. One of the things that I mentioned above was that I found that there were a few things that were open-ended. Usually this would be a complaint of mine if the book is a standalone (which this one is), but if those elements will be addressed in future companion novels, then by all means!Would I Recommend It:I highly recommend this novel. Fantasy fan, YA fan, someone who enjoyed Kristin Cashore's books, or Alexandra Bracken's Brightly Woven, etc. It's a standalone with an incredible and totally unique romance, and high-stakes action, and unforgettable world-building. This stunning debut did not disappoint on any level!Rating:5 stars. <--- That's a rare rating from me. I like it when I build a novel up in my head for forever, and then the novel turns out to be really, really wonderful. If you get a chance to read this book, do it! Don't miss this book!Heh. This one did not disappoint. We can totally compare it to Fire by Kristin Cashore - which happens to be my favorite book of all time.

So who knows. Maybe I'm just craving epic fantasy with good world building and this truly had that. And also that cover. C'mon. THAT COVER. Plus it featured writing and I think that's awesome. Because I quite like writing. As you can note by my obsession with writing aaaall the reviews.ANYWAY!I really appreciated the world!! It's all gods and temples and writing is so so sacred that no one else is allowed to do it except the king and the high people. And the world felt really dusty, almost like it had a Greek/Roman vibe maybe? I just envisioned all the temples like Greek ones. I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT OR NOT, BUT THERE YOU HAVE IT. And it's all masters vs slaves. And the masters were pretty brutal. The story didn't get really graphic because a lot of the brutality was off-page. But it still was a pretty vicious world and I, a lover of darker fantasy, APPRECIATED THAT.But whenever you have a masters vs slaves situation...omg. I get so attached to the tragic abused rebels. It's nearly a problem. #JonisTheDarlingGrapeLet's just pretend that the protagonist, Raisa, wasn't a little ball of deluded whining. Because all the other characters were MY PRECIOUS BABY DARLINGS. But seriously, Raisa? Her personality was: whine and cheese. I can't understand how she could be a slave for like 85% of her life and yet BE SO DARN NIAVE. She's having a passionate fling with the prince. THE P.R.I.N.C.E. And then gets shocked when she realises he's betrothed to a princess? I mean. C'mon. Woman, you need to grow a brain. But I did appreciate that (A) Raisa was no special snowflake, and (B) despite being a naive mulberry of delusion, tears, and frequent whine sessions: she was kindhearted and that's nice. But the secondary characters?!? LOVED THEM SO MUCH. Mati is the king and he's a bit of a sap, but A CUTE SAP. I really loved him. And noooo triangle. NONE WHATSOEVER WOOO. Because I started to get scared when the leader of the rebels, Jonis, strutted into the scene with his little sneers and his scars and his adorableness. But this is perfect because (A) it proved a protagonist can interact with a male and NOT FALL IN LOVE [wow], and (B) I can have Jonis. <33 Least to say 90% of everyone was tragic and I love tragic sneering metal rebel boys. Not to mention the adorable little 5-year-old Jera who's being trained as a Tutor and all the powerful women characters who just quietly were supreme.As for the plot? Okay. Confession: it's like 78% kissing. Which annoyed me. Like after 100-pages I was getting nervous that there would be no plot. BUT THERE WAS. IT JUST WAS IN AMONGST THE KISSING. So be ye warned: very heavy focus on the romance. And usually I would be stabbing myself in the eye with the pretty cover...but I shipped the ship and I loved the world SO YAY FOR THAT AT LEAST.There is also stabbing and explosions and plots and spying so that's all fun. Good times.Not to mention LIBRARIES. Although the library was like the secret kissing area....I mean. Dude. Go read a book, where are your priorities here. (Reading will get you killed but whatever.)I also like how it honestly feels like a standalone! Apparently there's a sequel in 2018? (Whyyyyyy so far away?) But you could read this and totally be satisfied with it alone. WHICH IS AWESOME. We need more fantasy books that stand (relatively) on their own. Plus it had no info dumps but managed to build a compelling world.BLESSINGS ON THIS BOOK.ALL IN ALL: I had a lot of fun reading this! I honestly didn't expect to love it due to reading a ton of negative reviews beforehand. But I think having zilch expectations really helped! The romance was afjdksalfd adorable and I really rooted for Mati and Raisa to stop lying to each other and BE FANTASTIC. The world was just dark enough to keep my little heart beating excitedly. And did I mention TRAGIC SCARRED SECONDARY CHARACTERS OF AWESOME? Because those too."}, {"userName": "Brittany Cavallaro", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13771-brittany-cavallaro", "userReview": "[isn't drawn into anything resembling a love triangle.

It seemed like even though she knew what she should and shouldn\u2019t be doing, she kept doing these things anyway, and I just wanted to smack her at times to see if it would knock some sense into her.The storyline in this followed Raisa as she began training to be a new tutor, and learning the symbols of the different languages. She was approached by the resistance and asked to do things for them, and also began a bit of a romance with the Prince, and seemed once again to not make the best choices. The pace was quite slow in this, although it did hold my attention pretty well in the first half of the story.The ending to this was okay, although my attention had lapsed a bit by the end.

Raisa is an utterly compelling heroine. I loved that she took time to grow into her strength and courage, to experience both love and heartbreak. She's one of the most relatable YA protagonists I've come across. The writing itself is lyrical and breathtaking. I think my favorite aspect of this world is the mythology. Each chapter begins with a section of the gods' creation story, and it absolutely felt like something I could have learned in the antiquities department of a university.

It surprised me so much, and so pleasantly. I just finished and am still thrumming with the happy energy of a truly satisfying ending. The pacing was interesting to me--the first half very much serves as an establishing of the world, the rules, the characters, the stakes, and the conflict. Which is to say that I was at first hooked based solely on the romance, while everything else was being set into place. Then, as the action was building, I felt a bit of a lull toward the middle but no sooner did I have that thought than everything exploded into action and the last third to half was an absolute ROLLERCOASTER. For me, this transition from steady to break-neck pacing worked perfectly because at that point, I was SO invested in the characters that I felt every beat of their wild ride exactly as McMillan intended me to do. While I read a ton of contemporary fantasy, it's not uncommon for me to struggle to connect with characters in high fantasy. There are authors I think handle this brilliantly (Bardugo, Maas, etc.) but a lot of times the unfamiliar world and the elevated way of speaking can leave characters feeling cardboard or unrelatable, but here I was so far from having that problem. I've seen some other reviews that called Raisa shallow but I honestly found her refreshingly complex and human. She is very much torn between her love for one specific person and her knowledge of right and wrong. Her struggle made me consider what I would do if I were forced between protecting the man I love and protecting a group of innocent people who I don't know. I think if we're honest this is a muchore difficult decision than it should be and I loved that Raisa continuously struggled with it, that she fought so hard to do what she needed to do. And because I felt I knew her so much, it just made her turmoil over whether she was trusting the wrong people that much more palpable. I found myself desperately hoping she was right, afraid of the heartbreak she would face if she was wrong.The ending was so, so surprising, and I suspect it won't be for everyone, but for me personally, it was perfect. It was big, epic, magical, exciting, and dark. I highly recommend this book and if you start it and get to that \"lull\", I implore you to finish it because I think there's a good chance you'll be, like me, way more than satisfied!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Ahiers", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2977875-sarah-ahiers", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to read an early version of this book and if you like YA high fantasy in the veins of Rae Carson, then you will LOVE this book.Raisa is raised as a slave in the palace, one of only two who are taught the language of the gods--writing--in order to tutor the prince and council him when he one day becomes king. But Raisa doesn't plan for falling in love with him, nor that he would return her love. Or that the slave resistance will pressure her to help them, even as it threatens the life and safety of both herself and the prince.When it all comes to a head, it seems only the gods will be able to save everyone.This story is filled with romance and wonderful, deeply realized characters. Raisa is sympathetic and believable, and Mati is swoon-worthy and kind, which I particularly love, since I'm kind of over the bad boy romance thing. The language and religion is fully developed and it's clear MacMillan spent a lot of time and energy getting it just right.

This was a fantasy power read for me--meaning, I read half one day and half the next, stopping only to sleep because the time change made me feel like 6pm was actually midnight!SWORD AND VERSE is a richly-imagined fantasy set in a world where words are sacred, and writing is permitted only to Scholars. Raisa is an Arnath slave selected to study the written language as Tutor to the Qilarite royals, whom she comes to know and care for despite the deep, painful divide between their peoples. Raisa's story begins as that of a girl trying to find her place in between two worlds--slave and not slave, Tutor and not Qilarite--but over time, the veil between these worlds drops, and Raisa begins to question all that she knows to be true.Perhaps the richest part of this story is how Raisa's own journey to understanding and action mirrors that of the ancient gods in this world. At the start of each chapter, we are treated to a tiny snippet of the Gods' story, and these snippets are just as captivating as the central narrative. Readers will love understanding how the worlds of the Gods and mortals collide, even when the characters do not.There's something in SWORD AND VERSE for every reader: a true and fraught romance, secret alliances and risky choices, truth and lies. The literary qualities and complex world building will appeal to fans of FINNIKIN OF THE ROCK (Marchetta) and THE DEMON KING (Cinda Chima), while the themes speak strongly to issues facing us in today's modern world.

The setting is sharp, so realistically drawn that it's easy to forget this is fantasy, and I haven't just wandered into some long-forgotten and magical era of our own past, and the characters, at once naive and endearing, strong and vengeful, pious and heretical, aren't historical figures but beautiful fictions that live only in the imagination."}, {"userName": "Damaris (GoodChoiceReading)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2378096-damaris-goodchoicereading", "userReview": "Yesssssssss!!!!

Full review to come!!! ----------------- FULL REVIEW 12/31/2015Sword and Verse takes readers on an unforgettable adventure. Not only is this book amazing from the first word to the very last, it is also unpredictable, and has the PERFECT romance.When I first saw the cover to this book I immediately knew I had to get my hands on it. Then I read the blurb and I was sold! I knew it would be one of those books that would keep me up all night reading, and would leave me with that craving for more. I honestly did not expect to be so into the story, and completely captivated with the characters like I was. It was all I thought about. Every single time I had to put the book down, I would get upset. I could not wait to dive back into Raisa\u2019s story. It is THAT good.One of the biggest things I love most about this story is the way the author wrote it. The story starts with Raisa as a young girl, and ends with her as a grown smart woman. I did not get lost once with the timeline. The author did an excellent job piecing it all together. For some reason this was a huge plus for me. The way the characters grow, the romance between Raisa & the Prince, the suspense whenever Raisa and the rebels were together, it was just flawless!I will say that a little more than half of the story is romance. Of course, me being a romance junkie, this just made me fall in love with the book ten times more! I can\u2019t describe the emotions I felt. Prince Mati & Raisa\u2019s feelings for one another bled off the pages and I absorbed every bit of it! At one point, the author had me worried. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going to happen to them as a couple, and was about ready to scream, but in the end I was happy with the outcome. Every detail, event, emotion, all happened at the right time, and all flowed together like putting the pieces to a puzzle together.SWORD AND VERSE is a GOOD CHOICE FOR READING! It\u2019s a story that you will devour and never forget. At least it was for me. Kathy MacMillan is officially on my MUST-READ list.

Adem\u00e1s, la historia se cierra por completo a pesar de que sea parte de una saga, tengo entendido que el siguiente libro son otros protagonistas."}, {"userName": "Amber (Books of Amber)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4354836-amber-books-of-amber", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Books of AmberI'm not entirely sure what the plot of\u00a0Sword and Verse was meant to be. It had such promise. Promise of a revolution, of a slave fighting back for her people. Typically those are the stories that pull me in and make me fall head over heels, but in this case it fell flat. It just wasn't executed in a way\u00a0that was enjoyable for me.The biggest problem with this book is that the main focus is the instalove and romance between Raisa and\u00a0Prince Mati. Obviously, this is forbidden, since Raisa is a slave, but there was no tension and\u00a0no chemistry between them at all. They fall in love right away,\u00a0and I was expecting Mati to be an \"innocent first love\" type thing, but that didn't turn out to be the case at all.I also had issues with the timeline of the story and the pace at which it progressed. The book skips forward a year after the first chapter, which would normally be okay, but we missed a lot of build up between Raisa and Mati, which would have been essential for a book with this amount of romance. Then we continue to skip forward\u00a0months into the future, and again, I feel like we missed a lot of character growth because of this.I started skimming after a while because the entire\u00a0first quarter - or first half, really - was just about Mati and Raisa's \"love\" and also about Raisa learning to read and write. There were too many descriptions of these writing lessons. I don't care if a letter has a curve that goes left or right, I just want something to happen!I'm incredibly disappointed by this book, and I'm hesitant to call it a fantasy novel. It's definitely more of a romance."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2669249-rebekah", "userReview": "Review found at: www.awesomebooknut.comThis story was so unique. I loved the overall story and plot of this book.This story tells of a unique kingdom that has conquered a people and outlawed learning to read and write. The levels of writing and who can read/write is complicated and different.Raisa was from a conquered people that should\u2019ve been extinct but she survived and is last of her \u201ckind.\u201d She doesn\u2019t tell anyone of what she knows and who she really is. She is forced into servitude in the palace. She is then specially chosen to learn to read and write so that one day she may teach the heir to the throne.She is thrown in with learning with the prince himself and they develop a bond and friendship which very quickly (when reading it) turns to love. Let\u2019s come back to that later.When the resistance contacts Raisa she has to make a choice that could help her people but put her at grave risk of her own life. The king does not toy or play with anyone breaking the law. Only certain kind of people are to be able to read and write. Raisa has to make a choice.I appreciated Rasia as a character overall. She is bright, determined, and strong.I really disliked the romance in this book. It was fast and it lacked mystery or anything magical. I found myself rolling my eyes A LOT and found it to be annoying. I thought and hoped that there might be another character involvement but I was disappointed. In the end, however I understood why the author did what she did even if I didn\u2019t care for it.Overall the story is intriguing and engaging, regardless if I hated the romance.Sexual Content: moderate (lots of kissing, knowledge of 2 character had sex)Language: mild/noneViolence: mildDrugs/Alcohol: mild/none"}, {"userName": "Parker Peevyhouse", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31350220-parker-peevyhouse", "userReview": "Should Raisa stay loyal to the prince she loves or help her enslaved people carry out a secret rebellion?I love what Kathy MacMillan does with the dilemma at the heart of this novel.

There is a lot of information, a very detailed setting, but with twists that change the original story. I don't think that Sword and Verse is actually a historical fiction, but I really wish that more books from that genre were more like this one. Sword and Verse would have benefited from being broken up into two books so that MacMillan would have had more time and space to develop the plot and the characters. The pacing of the book goes from to slow to BAM\u2014you've advanced months or even years forward in time. At times, it worked and during other times, it didn't. I really like Raisa and Mati's relationship, and I especially loved how much faith Mati had in Raisa, despite everything she put him through. However, I have to say that I found Raisa to be really frustrating at times; there may have been a few instances when I wanted to shake her a bit haha.

I don't even have words right now. I need to let everything sink down, but I'll write a review as soon as I can. --------------------------------------Okay, I'm not gonna lie, I finished this book on August 29, and since then I've forgotten a lot of details I wanted to talk about. I just forgot I hadn't written my review yet, sometimes I really don't like myself.Let me start of with saying that I won an Advanced Reader's Copy over on twitter by Harper 360 UK and I am so, so grateful that I got the chance to read this book early. I absolutely loved this book.First of all, this is a YA fantasy standalone. Doesn't that alone sell you? I know I was very intrigued when I heard it was a fantasy standalone. That very rarely happens. It worked perfectly as a standalone. There are almost no loose ends and the ending was perfect. There is one very little thing I was a little confused about, but that might have just been me. Sometimes I miss little things, mainly because English isn't my mother tongue. Something that plays a big part in this story is religion. I know a lot people sometimes have a hard time reading fantasy books that deals a lot with religion (I must say I'm not one of those people), but I think not many people will have that problem with this book. The religion ties in very well with the world building and the story overall. When I read the first chapter, I was afraid the story would be too juvenile for me because the main character, Raisa, was only fourteen. That was not true at all. The story takes place over a couple of years, and in the end Raisa was, I believe, eightteen. I loved that it takes place over such a time span because people really chance during the course of a couple of years, so you could really see some character development, by multiple characters. Because this book covers multiple years, the timespan of events and things that happen in this book is in my eyes very realistic. Sometimes you see in books that suddenly all hell breaks loose in just a few weeks or however long the timespan is in a book.I really hope this book will get a map. I always love seeing maps in fantasy books, but I think it,ll fit this story. It isn't pers\u00e9 neccessary to understand, but it would be nice. Raisa and her people are enslaved and takes to this land where the story takes place, but I'd like to see where her homeland would be compared to where she lives now etcetera. All with all, I really, really recommend this book. One of the best ones I've read this year. I think it's a very unique story. Definitely keep your eyes open in January, when it comes out :)"}, {"userName": "Melissa Gorzelanczyk", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5285139-melissa-gorzelanczyk", "userReview": "I received an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.The premise of this book is so unique and will appeal to teen who loves books, words and an unlikely love story. Kathy MacMillan has woven a wonderful story that demonstrates the power of language and communication, and the danger of limiting those within our world.Add Sword and Verse to your to-be read list!"}, {"userName": "nick ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2993271-nick", "userReview": "Out of all the Harper Teen Winter 2016 books, Kathy MacMillan's Sword and Verse was my most anticipated 2016 debut. The synopsis called to me with its mention of a kingdom where reading and writing is illegal. It sounded unique and a book brimming with a ton of potential. Sadly though, the execution of the story was faulty and Sword and Verse ended up disappointing me.There's a LOT that went wrong for me with Sword and Verse, but briefly, here are my main issues:Number 1: The bland and insufferable charactersAnytime I read a book, for me to actually like the story, I need to enjoy the characters, especially the narrators. When I can't see eye to eye with the character telling the story, then it's trouble in paradise for us no matter how exciting or interesting the story is. Without any doubt, characters are THE most important elements in a book for me. In Sword and Verse, I didn't care for any of the characters because they were flat, underdeveloped and caricatures of fantasy characters. From the protagonist, Raisa, to the villains, none of these characters were remotely given any kind of attention when it comes to past, growth and character-building. To me, they were just names on paper. We were told about these qualities Raisa had, but never truly shown them. Because of that, most of them just ended up being dull as dishwater and unmemorable in every way.Number 2: Terrible TERRIBLE romance Hate insta-love? Stay far far far away from Sword and Verse. I'm not one to usually vehemently hate on insta-love. But my goodness. The romance in Sword and Verse made me cringe with how uncomfortably fast it developed. By 20%, Raisa and her love interest, Prince Mati, have confessed their love for each other. By 25%, they've slept together. There was absolutely no build up, no chemistry to their relationship, which made the romance yet another boring and almost lifeless part of the story. It felt really sloppy, almost as if the author was told she needed to have a romance in her book when she didn't want to and so she tried her best to get it over with as quickly as possible. For a romance reader like me, the romance was really really frustrating. When you're sick and tired of the couple kissing (I swear Raisa and Mati kissed like EVERY freaking page - there is apparently something as too much kissing), you know the romance isn't for you.Number 3: Where's the world building? Where's the story? Really, where's ANYTHING interesting?As a fan of the written word, I was thrilled that Sword and Verse had all these cool Gods and symbols and a focus on literacy. That's like everything I want out of a book! But I was clearly wrong because apparently there are ways to make an intriguing concept like that flat as a pancake. The world building in Sword and Verse was truly lacking, the story telling offering nothing fresh in the fantasy genre. It was disheartening because this is a book that had so much of unexplored potential. It could have been EPIC, but the execution was sadly not that great.I'm sad that I disliked this book so much but there just wasn't any part of Sword and Verse I was invested in. As an author, I think MacMillan has the creative juices and the potential, but perhaps she needs to work on her character development and pacing issues. I'm willing to give her a second chance if she ever does write another book in the future though."}, {"userName": "Glory", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2015", "userURL":

Forced to serve in the palace of the King, she\u2019s endured hunger, abuse, and the harrowing fear of discovery. Everyone knows that Raisa is Arnath, but not that she is a Learned One, a part of an Arnath group educated in higher order symbols. In Qilara, this language is so fiercely protected that only the King, the Prince, and Tutors are allowed to know it. So when the current Tutor-in-training is executed for sharing the guarded language with slaves and Raisa is chosen to replace her, Raisa knows that, although she may have a privileged position among slaves, any slipup could mean death.That would be challenging enough, but training alongside Prince Mati could be her real undoing. And when a romance blossoms between them, she\u2019s suddenly filled with a dangerous hope for something she never before thought possible: more. Then she\u2019s approached by the Resistance\u2014an underground army of slaves\u2014to help liberate the Arnath people. Joining the Resistance could mean freeing her people\u2026but she\u2019d also be aiding in the war against her beloved, an honorable man she knows wants to help the slaves.Working against the one she loves\u2014and a palace full of deadly political renegades\u2014has some heady consequences. As Raisa struggles with what\u2019s right, she unwittingly uncovers a secret that the Qilarites have long since buried\u2026one that, unlocked, could bring the current world order to its knees.And Raisa is the one holding the key.", "title": "Sword and Verse\n      \n          (Sword and Verse #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22065067-sword-and-verse", "average": 3.46, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435881988l/22065067.jpg", "reviews": 446, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/644355.Kathy_MacMillan", "name": "Kathy MacMillan"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Romance", "Fantasy", "Did Not Finish"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22065067-sword-and-verse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35236799-tinta-y-fuego", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21912548-baby-storytime-magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6346337-storytime-magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449180-dagger-and-coin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465027-little-hands-big-hands", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11470406-kindergarten-magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
