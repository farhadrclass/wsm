On the one hand, I liked the characters, and the story of one girl's struggle to find her Chinese birth family was both gripping and moving, right to the last page (not counting the epilogue). On the other hand, I didn't much care for the style, and there were points when I found the jarring POV shifts sufficiently annoying that I just had to put the book down: most of the time the story follows Mia's point of view, and sometimes Jax's, but then some scenes start head-hopping across several minor characters. The inconsistency just bugged me. So... I enjoyed this story, but I didn't thoroughly enjoy the process of reading it. A pity, as it really could have been excellent."}, {"userName": "Carey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5887873-carey", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book because a novel about an international adoptee searching for her birth-story and birth-family appeals to me. And I think there is a passionate audience for this type of story. However, the actual writing style and language kept pulling me out of the pages and often had me rolling my eyes.The author knows a lot about Chinese culture, adoption in general, Chinese adoption specifically, and Chinese orphanages. The problem is that she tried to cram so much information in there was no room for the story to breathe. Everything felt forced. The dialog was unnatural and unwieldy. The author changed tense within a single paragraph. She changed narrators within a single paragraph. I think the story itself could have been great...it just needed to go through a lot of revisions to make it readable."}, {"userName": "Books", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6665735-books", "userReview": "This story wasn\u2019t quite what I had expected, and Mia\u2019s search for her birth parents took a huge backseat to Mia\u2019s romance with Jax, and them shopping and spending time together. That did not appeal to me and I rapidly had to change my expectations for the rest of the story.However, where this novel excels is in capturing the culture, struggles, and immense poverty of China, as well as its government\u2019s utter carelessness and disregard toward Chinese children, the elderly and the poor. The parts in the book that interested me most were Bratt\u2019s vivid and insightful descriptions of the mismanagement of funds in the orphanages, the callous way in which the children in these orphanages are treated, and how criminals ruthlessly abduct and torture children to turn them into street beggars and criminals. I think most of us have a pretty good idea of what\u2019s happening in China, but Bratt\u2019s excellent narrative in this regard really brings it home to the reader. For that alone this novel is worth the read.The ending and epilogue wasn\u2019t to my taste though. I\u2019m happy that Mia finally got the answers she wanted, but everything was too Disney-happily-ever-after, and thus hampered what could\u2019ve been a great ending for all. Still, I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend this book for what the book summary promises, but it is eye-opening to see what these orphaned children have to endure."}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5946923-gina", "userReview": "The plot of this book is interesting enough to keep your interest, and as someone who has lived for a long time in China, I am impressed with the accuracy of the cultural insights the author makes as a backdrop to the story. The writing, however, is fairly amateur, so much so that I almost had to stop reading. If you're looking for a quick read and a glimpse into Chinese culture, it's enjoyable. If you're looking for good quality literature, skip it."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4239132-kathleen", "userReview": "What would you do if you had been adopted at a young age and suppressed the feeling of abandonment, only to realize that now as an adult, in order to move forward you need to know your past? Could you take the risk of possibly never finding out the truth of why you were placed in an orphanage and put up for adoption? How will your decision affect your relationship with your adopted family? If you do find out the truth, how will it affect and/or change your future? These are the questions that Mia, a young Chinese woman had to consider in her quest of Chasing China for the truth of her adoption.Mia is a young Chinese college student who was adopted in China by an American family at the age of four. Throughout her childhood she had suppressed the feeling of abandonment, no one knew of the turmoil that grew inside of her. She had even tried to resist the urging of her adopted parents to learn the culture and traditions of her motherland. It wasn't until she went away to college that she realized that her life had been a facade, that in reality, the mystery of her birth parents and adoption really had bothered her for a very long time. She figured out that she wouldn't be able to move forward in her life until she faced the truth about her past. While she was on spring break from college, Mia decided to embark on a life changing journey of self-discovery of who she was, in order to become who she can be in the future. That journey led her to travel to her motherland, China, to embark on an odyssey that would be filled with mystery, betrayal, deception, heartache, loss, discovery, love and redemption.Chasing China is a powerful and compelling story of a young woman seeking to find answers about her birth family, her past and the reason for her adoption. The storyline was well written and intriguing, as Mia embarks on her journey to seek answers, the reader comes along for the ride that proves to be one of an emotional roller coaster. The characters were well developed and realistic, their complex personalities and interactions with each other gave the story depth and made it that much more compelling. I loved how Mia and Jax's relationship developed throughout the story, it provided a lighter part to an otherwise very heart wrenching and difficult journey that Mia endured while on her search for the truth of her past. The author's description of the setting in China was fascinating, I found myself googling the Chinese cities of Suzhou, Shanghai and Xi'an, just to satisfy my curiosity. I also found that her description of the Chinese culture and traditions were equally fascinating. I always enjoy a story that has descriptions that embraces the reader. I think that the author's personal experience of having lived and worked in China, especially within the orphanage and adoption process, enriched the story and made it that much more compelling and powerful. The author's description of the heart wrenching plight of the Chinese population, especially that of the orphans and street children, and the shady government tactics and corrupt bureaucracy was very disturbing, it made me wonder what other atrocities that the Chinese people may have to endure under their government. I think that by telling Mia's story, the author is promoting awareness of this disturbing plight of the Chinese children to the rest of the world.Chasing China is an hauntingly beautiful story that is powerful and compelling, it begs to be read by readers who have an interest in the adoption process, and who embrace human interest stories.Disclaimer: At the request of the author and Chick Lit Plus, a Kindle edition of the book was sent, at no cost to me, for my honest review and participation in the virtual book tour event.Virtual Book Tour Event: On Thursday, February 23, 2012, in association with Chick Lit Plus, Kay Bratt participated in a virtual book tour event with an Author Interview on Jersey Girl Book Reviews.http://jerseygirlbookreviews.blogspot... http://jerseygirlbookreviews.blogspot..."}, {"userName": "Nancy Peifer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4782106-nancy-peifer", "userReview": "SPOILER ALERT...At first I thoufgt it was a great read as it delves into the difficult identity issues of adoptees, but the end was very disappointing. The author opts for the \"happy ever after fantasy\" ending where the adoptee finds she was desperately wanted by her birth parents, she is easily reunited with her birth father, and more good comes forth.While this is a plausible ending in China, I think it is not most adoptees' experience. A more realistic ending would have had her NOT finding her birth parents and wrestling through those ramifications for her life. I write this review from the perspective of being an adoptive mother. I wouldn't recommend this book to my kids because it could \"add insult to injury\" as their story is not a storybook tale. I applaud the intent of the author and the first part of the book is quite good and handles the need for the adoptive child's search for their birth parents well. But I think that the ending could cause those whose lives have not been touched by adoption to come away with an inaccurately rosy view of the unanswered questions and unresolved grief most adoptees must learn to deal with for their entire lives. Adoption is a beautiful process--but it is not easy. There are many layers to the experience and it is in the adoptee's and the adoptive family's journey that resolution and beauty come forth--not in finding all the hoped for answers to their searching."}, {"userName": "Helen Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15439383-helen-thompson", "userReview": "Written for teens adopted from China, this book explores the identity feelings many adoptees, from China, deal with.

The brief description sounded interesting enough, so I \"purchased\" it. Because it was free, I had little expectation of it. If it was mildly enjoyable, I would be happy.This book did not disappoint me, and actually, it exceeded my expectations. I really did like it. It isn't a difficult read, so I was able to finish it in one day easily. However, being an easy read did not detract from the content. Toward the end, I found that I couldn't put it down, even for a moment. I really wanted to see what happened in the end; I couldn't and didn't wait. Typically I do not like to give most of the plot away in my reviews, which can be challenging. So if I am vague, it is done intentionally. The story is centered around a young college girl who, as a child, was adopted from China by an American couple. Throughout her young life she struggled not only with the difference in appearance between her and her adoptive family but with the fact that her birth parents abandoned her. To find the answers to her questions concerning her origins and birth parents, she travels, with the blessing of her adoptive family, to China. Keep in mind that the author does a great job with letting the readers understand that the young lady loves her adoptive family and being an American. She does not question their love or her love for them, and she truly appreciates that they chose to adopt her. Her American parents, who she refers to as her real mom and dad, fully support her on the quest for answers, despite their concerns for her safety.The book focuses on her journey in China. The author paints a picture of China which is both beautiful and sad. I found myself intrigued by the many characters the girl met along the way. At the end of the story it was revealed that it is indeed fiction but based on several real people that the author had met. Unfortunately, one of the saddest parts of the book was indeed real. Overall the book contained a bit of drama, suspense, action, romance, and travel aspects. In the end, I was happy with the ending for - almost - all the characters. Despite China's corrupt government and inappropriate use of the money intended for orphanages, I wouldn't hesitate to rescue a child through adoption, if only I were younger and in better health.Note: I found this book for free on the Amazon site (for the Kindle) just after Christmas; however, it is now listed at $2.99. Because of this, the price may vary from time-to-time. In my opinion, it is worth the $2.99. It's an easy, enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "E.B.

She was told that she was left at a train station when she was just a baby, and lived in an orphanage until she was adopted by her American family. But the time has come for Mia to see China, the orphanage where she once lived, and try to find out more about the Chinese culture. Mia is shocked when she sees firsthand what the orphans go through \u2013 no love, strict schedules, and the bare minimum when it comes to toys, food, and clothes. More than just the orphanages, Mia learns from her new friend Jax about how children are kidnapped from their homes and forced to beg and steal on the streets. As Mia tries to learn more about her past, she realizes how lucky she was to be adopted by her family, and feels a growing compassion for those in China that she meets. But will Mia accomplish what she really set out to find \u2013 her birth family?Chasing China by Kay Bratt was such an emotional story. I love how much you learn from reading, and this is definitely a book that educated me on a topic I had never previously heard of. From the orphanages to the kidnappings to the government officials covering up certain situations \u2013 this made for quite the read. Bratt weaves Mia\u2019s journey with a delicate hand but a strong voice. Mia is so brave and such a beautiful heroine. I loved the romance angle as well, except there were a few times where I thought Jax\u2019s dialogue was a bit peculiar. To my ears he sounded much older than his age. There were a few editing mistakes that I caught along the way as well, but nothing to really deter me from the plot.

She is one of the many Chinese girls who were adopted overseas. Although Mia had a wonderful childhood and a loving adoptive family, part of her cannot rest until she discovers more about who she is, where she came from, and why her birth family deserted her at the age of one in a train station, leaving her to spend several years in a state-run orphanage before being adopted at age four.When Mia visits the orphanage where she lived with a translator, she is appalled at the shabbiness but even more at the emotional starvation the children there encounter. In order to feed, clothe and educate so many children, every minute of their day is strictly scheduled, and the caretakers don't have time to give praise or affection. The children are treated as items on an assembly line. Mia is also suspicious when her questions go unanswered or given an airy reply of \"Later\". She is unsure if her translator is giving her all the information the officials speak.As the days go by, Mia explores other avenues to discover her past. She meets Jax, another Chinese-American who helps her. Jax is in China on an internship and is willing to help Mia find out whatever they can. They post fliers and hunt down clues. Mia also starts to work with a group of foreign women; expatriates who are in China for a year or two and who have chosen the orphanage as a charity. Through these avenues, Mia gets closer to the truth, but it is uncertain if she will ever discover what occurred all those years ago.Kay Bratt has worked in the field of overseas adoption for many years.

This is a novel, but I am sure some of what is discussed it fact. The Chinese daughter of a middle class American family wants to visit her roots. It is not the story of waitng for years to finally get to go to China. I thought it was very insightful to learn of her feelings of inadequacy. The character hated being different. She begged her dad to let her have surgery to make her eyes wider. She dyed her hair. Anything to make her less Chinese, she would try. The story of her being placed in the orphanage, was that she had been abandoned at a train station. This is not an unusual occurance in China, and so it was assumed as truth. As she gets to China, she starts the search for her family. It is not as easy as geneology in the States. People dont want to help, or they can't. The girl meets another Chinese American teenage boy who is doing an internship, and together they search for her past.

And beta readers are not editors. I'm sorry, but if you want to be taken seriously as an author, you must edit or be edited. You cannot change POV from first to third person in italicized internal dialogue. Pick a convention and stick to it. A prologue is an out-of-sequence setup to the main body of a story; its only purpose is to be a strong hook when the beginning to your story is weak. (Solution? Fix the beginning to the story, and the prologue is unnecessary.) A prologue is almost always out of chronological sequence to a story as told. It's either a jump to the middle action, in which case, the scene will be revisited, or it takes place in the distant past as a setup.I really wanted to like the book.

The dialogue between Mia and Jax, a young man she befriends while in China, feels very unnatural, as though the author is trying too hard to create a flirty conversation between two twenty-something's. while I feel that I learned a lot about the subject (the author is obviously quite knowledgable), overall I was disappointed."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7606431-alison", "userReview": "(kindle) - In this novel Mia, a young woman who was adopted from china when she was a young child goes back there on a break from college to try and find the piece of herself that she always felt was missing. Having been told that she was abandoned she want to find out the truth and try and find her birth parents as well. The storyline has a bit of a mystery, and love story to it, as well as a group of interesting characters.. The Author, who wrote: \"Silent Tears: A Journey Of Hope In A Chinese Orphanage\" (her experiences, living in China and volunteering in an Orphanage) incorporated a lot of her true experiences through out the story line, which made it very interesting."}, {"userName": "Auriella", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3665043-auriella", "userReview": "This was an interesting book. It actually got more intriguing as the book went by. I was interested in it because eventually I will be adopting a child, and this was a peek at something that hopefully my future child will never go through. The writing style really was not all that great, and the conversations were not actually written as how it would be spoken, so I just kept reading to get the story finished.I liked the ending. It really brought together what the author was trying to get across. I think I was actually a little shocked that I did not see the ending coming. Overall, the story was good, the writing not so much."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27158037-terri", "userReview": "This touching story about a girl adopted from China as a young child and raised in America had a lot of interesting cultural details and had enough interest to pull through. However there were some ar eas of the book that felt lagging. The second half of the book seemed more interesting than the first half, so if you can make it through the first hundred pages, the last hundred are worth it. The main character was hard to get a hold of her age and maturity level, at times seeming to be a high school stufent and at others seeming post undergraduate school aged. Different read from what I normally pick up, good for a free book."}], "description": "Mia left China as a small child, destined to be protected within the loving arms of an all-American family.
