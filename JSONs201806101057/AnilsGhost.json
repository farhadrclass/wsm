This was a scarring psychosis in the country. Death, loss, was \u2018unfinished,\u2019 so you could not walk through it. There had been years of night visitations, kidnappings or murders in broad daylight. The only chance was that the creatures who fought would consume themselves. All that was left of law was a belief in an eventual revenge towards those who had power.\nAnil is an expat Sri Lankan, expert in the forensics of old bones. She returns to Sri Lanka to examine archeological remains and discovers evidence of recent atrocities. This is a portrait of a Sri Lanka riven with murderous conflict, a fascist state in which dissent yields death. Thousand are murdered on an ongoing basis, and no evidence of wrongdoing will be allowed to reach daylight. Anil fights her own memories of life in Sri Lanka, family, relationships. There are several memorable characters, including a disgraced anthropologist reduced to blindness and an austere life that he found satisfying, another anthropologist who gets Anil involved in the atrocity evidence. It is very interesting.

I would rather say it is composed of silences between them. So many things are untold in \u201cAnil\u2019s Ghost\u201d, but can be perceived and felt so clearly. To me this eloquent mosaic of silences was as important, as beautiful and poetic as Ondaatje\u2019s words in this fragmented story. And what can better transmit the fear of the people caught amidst the Sri Lanka civil war than silence?Ondaatje loosely tells us about the situation in Sri Lanka during some of the worst years of the civil war, where people felt trapped in the conflict between the government, the antigovernment insurgents and the separatist guerillas. During these years people were disappearing in big numbers, their bodies later appearing in the sea, rivers, fields or crowded hospitals. More often, they became lost forever. The three conflicting groups were the main players in this terror, none better in its methods than the other, which meant that the only way for people to survive was keeping their heads low and being silent. Not asking questions. Not looking for the answers, not wanting the truth.Anil, a forensic pathologist who left Sri Lanka, her country of origin, fifteen years ago, comes back on a seven week mission to investigate the infringements of the human rights in the country. She is determined to identify a victim whose bones were found in the area protected by the government. Will her quest for truth be successful? Could naming one victim help her name and stand for all of them? Does it really matter which group is responsible? Can the truth be more important than peace? Anil\u2019s local partner in the investigation is Sarath, a Sri Lankan archeologist, who finds solace in his studies. Archeological artefacts serve him as an anchor, the only things that are stable in his life, never changing throughout thousands of years. Sarath seems to Anil remote and impenetrable, difficult to trust because of his contacts in the government. And then there is Gamini, Sarath\u2019s younger brother, one of the most beautifully crafted characters I have met in my literary life. Gamini is a doctor who is not capable of sleep, except for maybe a short moment in a bed of a ward, who almost lives in the hospital, never finding peace anywhere else, who is afraid of the dead, afraid to see their faces, lest he recognizes them. A doctor, a forensic pathologist and an archeologist. A study of the living, the dead and the immortality. The book evolves slowly, taking us back and forth in time, peeling off the layers of its characters, getting us closer to their nature, revealing one startling and uncomfortable truth after another, until we are sucked in, immersed in this wearisome journey and until it spits us out burnt-out and wasted and, perhaps, a little less ignorant."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie", "userReview": "It\u2019s the civil war in Sri Lanka. Anil, the novel\u2019s heroine, is a forensic anthropologist and part of a team investigating possible war crimes. She is paired for the investigation with a government-selected archaeologist named Sarath, an enigmatic man 16 years her senior. Together Anil and Sarath find four skeletons whom they nickname Tinker, Tailor, Soldier and Sailor, the last a source of obsessive fascination. The task is to give Sailor back his identity in order to incriminate the government of war crimes. In the process Anil will have her own identity given back to her. As you\u2019d expect from Ondjaate this is a novel brimming with beautiful prose. Its central theme is a kind of archaeology of the soul. Anil in the course of the novel will sift through layers of the soil of her own being and of her native country\u2019s history, raising ghosts. On one level it\u2019s a detective story but runs much deeper than that. Though not quite as far reaching as The English Patient it shares a similar structure - a mosaic of fragmented events that are eventually artfully interlocked."}, {"userName": "\u00b7Karen\u00b7", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen", "userReview": "Against the obscenity of large numbers\nWhen a writer, dauntless and unflinching, turns his piercing gaze on mass murder, how does he drag it back into the realm of the human? In 2666 Bolano gave to each and every one of the women murdered in Santa Teresa (Ciudad Juarez), a name, or the clothes they were wearing, or where they were murdered, or, at the very least, how they were found and what happened to the corpse afterwards. He turns each one into an individual, even in the relentless cataloguing of their deaths we never lose sight of the individual human being, loved and missed and mourned. Some 300 pages that retain a steadfast sobriety, as any descent into bathos would become unbearable, self-defeating. Now, that is perhaps just possible when dealing with numbers that creep into the hundreds, but what do you do with this particular breathtaking footnote of history? The civil war that flared up in Sri Lanka in 1983: by early 2000, 18 years of war had claimed the lives of more than 64,000, mostly civilians. Sixty four thousand. Sixty four thousand.One village can speak for many villages. One victim can speak for many victims. In a sixth century Buddhist monks' burial midden, located in a government archaeological preserve, four modern skeletons are found. Anil Tissera is a forensic pathologist, sent by a Geneva Human Rights organization, teamed with a Colombo archaeologist in a seven week project as a gesture to placate trading partners in the West. Anil and her partner name these four skeletons Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor. Sailor is the only skeleton with a skull. They work to uncover the truth of his particular fate. Proof of one type of crime, that will speak for many crimes. One victim that will speak for many victims. But at a time of war the truth is a flame against a lake of petrol. Anil's status as a delegate of a Western organization might protect her - but what of her colleague?Ondaatje uses a narrative style that skirts around the story. Obtuse, dislocated, off-centre, like Anil herself, born in Sri Lanka, now ex-pat, she has created a new centre of self around her intellect and her scientific, rational approach to life, an approach which holds her at a distance, protects her from pain. The narrative too holds us at a distance which makes the swift and sudden incursion of horror all the more intense. Gradually, like the reader, Anil is made to look straight at the face of death, rather than busying herself with the details of forensic evidence. In a process that reflects precisely what this novel does, Ananda, the artist, recreates an individual face out of the skull. But Ananda has lost his wife in the terror, so the face is peaceful: \"It's what he wants of the dead.\" Anil rose and walked back into the dark rooms. She could no longer look at the face, saw only Ananda's wife in every aspect of it. She sat down in one of the large cane chairs in the dining room and began weeping. ... Her eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, she could see the rectangular shape of a painting and beside it Ananda standing still, looking through the blackness at her."}, {"userName": "Marguerite", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1038238-marguerite", "userReview": "I tried to read this once before, but I couldn't get much past page 80. This time, I couldn't put it down, which just reinforces my belief that there's a right time and a wrong time to read each book. This time, I'd been prepared by The Ministry of Special Cases and \"The Caretaker,\" a story in Anthony Doerr's The Shell Collector. I wonder, now, about my recent attraction to refugee fiction or desaparecido fiction. What, exactly, am I looking for? What have I lost, or left behind?Ondaatje's characters are as complex and interesting as Sri Lanka. I think the shifting perspectives in the different sections might have put me off the first go-round. When I stopped reading for the night at the end of a character's section, the book made more sense. The events and constant suspicion/paranoia that are inevitable in an environment where people keep disappearing while the \"enemy\" is an unknown held the different sections together nicely. The lack of perfect resolution at the end fit, too. Ondaatje's writing is frequently lyrical:\"Patterns of death always surrounded him. In his work he felt he was somehow the link between the mortality of flesh and bone and the immortality of an image on rock, or even, more strangely, its immortality as a result of faith or an idea. So the removal of a wise sixth-century head, the dropping off of arms and hands of rock as a result of the fatigue of centuries, existed alongside human fate. He would hold statues two thousand years old in his arms. Or place his hand against old, warm rock that had been cut into a human shape. He found comfort in seeing his dark flesh against it. This was his pleasure. Not conversation or the education of others or power, but simply to place his hand against a gal vihara, a living stone whose temperature was dependent on the hour, whose look of porousness would change depending on rain or a quick twilight.\"This rock hand could have been his wife's hand. It had a similar darkness and age to it, a familiar softness.\"This gave me a lot to think about: a fifth-century Chinese society that put music at the heart of its civilization, the qualities of any writer, temple stones being the recipients of confessions, understanding gained by studying weaknesses, not strengths.I'd like to read more by the author, who's published more poetry than anything else."}, {"userName": "Lucy Banks", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57486568-lucy-banks", "userReview": "Beautiful, restrained... but at times, completely meandering!I've already read The English Patient, so wasn't surprised when I dived into Ondaatje's world again, which feels very dreamy and evocative. It was a pleasure to read, but at times, a little frustrating... I sometimes had to go back and remind myself which character we were focusing on!The story is centred round Anil, a champion swimmer turned forensic expert, who has returned to Sri Lanka to investigate a mysterious skeleton, buried in an ancient site. It ties in with the bigger picture of the war in Sri Lanka, which I found fascinating, as it's not something I knew anything about before. Throughout the story, we don't just get to know Anil, but also the minor characters that enter her world, those damaged by the effects of the war around them. I loved this aspect of it, it added a lot of depth.Ondaatjes language is spectacular at times, with gorgeously poetic phrases that make the book that much more beautiful. However, I'd personally say that plot is something of an issue, as it drifts, rather than drives you through. Just to emphasise though, if you're happy to sit back and simply let his stunning use of language wash over you, this isn't a problem!

And ppl on Goodreads had described it as dense with the language being difficult and all that. Also, my experience with the author's The English Patient wasn't a happy one. Anyway, to cut the long story short I somehow got around to it. It was a really rewarding experience. It is hard to tell the story. In that way, it is structured more like connecting short stories. It is about a forensic pathologist, a woman, who comes to Sri Lanka when the civil war was at its peak and about a couple of other guys who work with her. The writing was awesome. For me, it worked on so many levels. A Part of the story was like solving a murder mystery. Some portion about the personal lives of the three characters which was also very interesting and literary, a general commentary on the war-torn life of ppl, all with archeology as the backdrop - the technical details of which I found interesting. It didn't go abt giving a political commentary on who was right and who wasn't among the warring factions. Just the consequences and how the personal lives are affected by that. So you need not have a great understanding of the Sri Lankan civil war. It is cool to pick the book without knowing anything about it. Honestly, despite being a Tamil, I didn't know it was this bad. But this is not a totally grim book. This is the kind of book that I always want to read. Highly recommend it to Literary fiction readers.

One strength of the novel, in addition to its many moments of beautiful writing, is the way it weaves archeology, forensic anthropology, and cultural anthropology into a narrative of complementary epistemologies while at the same time unfurling a mystery through the trajectories of its diverse cast of characters. Each form of knowledge is embodied by a well-developed character and each character in the novel also personifies limitations and biases of their discipline while at the same time all are necessary to complete the picture for the reader. These forms of knowledge also serve as a filter, a heuristic, and a coping mechanism for the characters and the reader through which to explain the inexplicable: the atrocities of the Sri Lankan civil war. As a contribution to the form of the novel, this is brilliantly done and puts the novel in the tradition of Wilkie Collins' Moonstone, a Victorian novel that first used multiple narrators to build a detective story. Despite the mystery of Soldier's identity that drives the story (and that mirrors Anil's own and not-always-conscious quest for self-identity), Anil's Ghost is never quite a detective story or a multi-narrator novel, however, as the center of narrative gravity never completely leaves Anil's perspective. The novel's greatest weakness to me as fiction was also something I found valuable as a travel guide and for it's appeal to my intellectual curiosity: many extensive discursions (yes, that's a word!) that seek to explain details about the culture or disciplines, for example about forensics. Ondaatje clearly had a field day (no archeology pun intended ;) ) with all the textbooks and sources he cites in a meaty appendix of source texts and materials. I had just returned from Sri Lanka when I finished this and found reading the second half after my journey much more engaging the first half prior to traveling. There is a classicism to the prose and dialogue that may provide another coping filter to the underlying atrocity but I found the lack of a single contraction in anyone's dialogue, for example, off-putting, drawing my attention to the writer's distance and intellectual craftsmanship when I sought greater absorption in the narrative, characters, and exquisite descriptions of setting. Having met so many wonderful Sri Lankans on my trip, only one person I met spoke in extended discursive paragraphs as many of the characters do here (and that person's paragraphs were not nearly as composed and writerly as these). Improbable recollections of exhaustively catalogued details from the protagonist's forensic textbooks and lapses into exposition for exposition's sake (i.e., to inform the reader) and many moments of unrealistic writerly dialogue only barely mar an otherwise engrossing narrative. While I found them intrusive, the many discursions provide good fodder for travelers and others seeking to know more about Sri Lankan history and the play of disciplines contributes to this novel's intricate and formally apt approach to truth-telling through novel form.

It is also very honest: the science does not magically resolve itself, but must be worked at; the war is hideous; the cultural knowledge is first-hand; and the heroics are small, if they exist at all, and usually brutally punished. It is as frequently frustrating, unfortunately, as it is beautiful. Maybe it's just my simple, Hemingway-esque soul, but at times I just wanted him to tell me a story without another unrelated, and usually heartbreaking, tangent. Though - not to be contrary - it was one of those tangents that sticks with me most: the vignette of the title character and her best friend diagnosing the injuries of heroes in their favorite movies. Still, I left this book unsettled, sad, and feeling strangely lost. But then, I suppose, how else are you supposed to leave a book on civil war? Hard to recommend, and yet, I'm glad to have read it.

Atrocities are being committed by three groups: the government, anti-government insurgents, and separatist guerrillas. Working secretly, these warring forces are decimating a population paralyzed by pervasive fear. Taciturn archeologist Sarath Diyasena is assigned by the government to be Anil's partner; at 49, he is emotionally withdrawn from the chaotic contemporary world, reserving his passion for the prehistoric shards of his profession. Together, Anil and Sarath discover that a skeleton interred among ancient bones in a government-protected sanctuary is that of a recently killed young man. Anil defiantly sets out to document this murder by identifying the victim and then making an official report. Throughout their combined forensic and archeological investigation, detailed by Ondaatje with the meticulous accuracy readers will remember from descriptions of the bomb sapper's procedures in The English Patient, Sarath remains a mysterious figure to Anil. Her confusion about his motives is reinforced when she meets his brother, Gamini, an emergency room doctor who is as intimately involved in his country's turmoil as Sarath refuses to be. The lives of these characters, and of others in their orbits, emerge circuitously, layer by layer. In the end, Anil's moral indignation--and her innocence--place her in exquisite danger, and Sarath is moved to a life-defining sacrifice.This was a strange book in a way but very moving and haunting, Anil has come back to Sri Lanka to reconnect with her past but doesn't seem to know how to do it."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3078960-vicki", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book.

This is a...complex book. It's the story of Anil, a forensic anthropologist who works with the UN and returns to Sri Lanka for the first time in fifteen years on an investigation. But while it's about Anil and the skeleton of a civil war victim that she unearths, it's more about Sri Lanka itself. It's not just Anil's story, but the story of those who help her - an archaeologist, Sarath; his doctor brother, Gamini; the statue carver, Ananda. It's the story of their experiences with the civil war, uncovering victims, working to save victims, becoming victims. We don't get a huge amount of information about the civil war outside of a \"there are rebels and there are government forces and there's the government itself, and all of them can be majorly sucky\". Instead, what we see is the impact that the war had on Sri Lanka's people. Anil has been away for years, and more or less considers herself a westerner now. While she still remembers the basics of the language and the culture, she's been away for the duration of the war and doesn't understand that her actions have consequences. Where others are cautious and careful about what they say and where they say it, Anil stumbles through making demands and questioning processes. Near the end of the book, Gamini passes comment that in western films and books, the story always ends with the western hero boarding a plane and flying home, usually with a girl at his side. For the hero, the war is over, and therefore it's the same for the audience. But that's not the truth that's reflected on the ground. People still have to live there, whether it's fighting for survival or picking up the pieces. And it's this that Ondaatje shows us here. While the book is billed as \"a riveting mystery\" about the hunt to identify the victim whose skeleton they find, that's really only a minor piece of the puzzle. It's not a particularly easy read - the story is fragmented between the four main characters, unravelling in pieces over the course of the three hundred-ish pages.

All the different ways of thinking about rock are woven brilliantly into the story and I came away feeling immersed in highly complex, satisfying metaphors. The book is also about the relationship we have with our pasts and the suffering caused by war. Yet while the novel's many gorgeous scenes are successfully strung together, there is still something missing. The writing is beautiful, but I rarely felt for the characters.

The book traces a number of characters - Anil the forensic scientist, Sarath the archaeologist, Sarath's brother a doctor, Saraths's old mentor now blind and living as an ascetic, and Ananda a drunk but former expert in painting eyes on Buddhas. Anil, born in Sri Lanka but living in the US, is sent by a human rights organisation to investigate certain deaths that have occurred that may be linked to the Sri Lankan government. The investigation often takes a back seat to character's anecdotes and how the violence and deaths of the civil war have affected them, the nameless victims and the war where no one knows who or where their enemies are."}, {"userName": "Bryn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/784920-bryn", "userReview": "I first encountered Michael Ondaatje's writing through the English patient (via the film) and was so taken by his style that I sought out other books.What captivates me is the incredibly pared down, minimal writing that manages to communicate so much. I find it breathtaking to read.This is a brutal novel. I gather Shri Lanka is Ondaatje's country of origin, so it's hard not to see this book as having a eprsonal element. Anil is an expert at determining what people did in life by examnining their bodies. She hs a corpse of a man, and too many stories about those disappeared in dark political times. There are a lot of ghosts in this book, a lot of hard choices and troubled morals. Nothing is easy, or comfortable, or without consequence.It is a heart breaking, awe inspiring piece of work.

I found fear.\nThe Sri Lankan Civil War lasted for over 25 years -- resulting in the deaths of 80 000 - 100 000 people -- and while it was still raging, Sri Lankan-Canadian author Michael Ondaatje set his fictional characters the task of uncovering the truth of the conflict; discovering to what degree the Sri Lankan government was murdering its own citizens. In Anil's Ghost, the main character Anil is an ex-pat Sri Lankan -- a forensic pathologist, trained and employed in the West -- who has returned to her homeland after fifteen years at the request of a human rights organization. She is teamed with a local archeologist named Sarath who, with a mysterious demeanor and known government contacts, Anil is wary of trusting. When they find a skeleton that might prove the government's involvement in a murder and its coverup, Anil is forced to trust Sarath as he leads her to various locations and involves local experts.Anil's Ghost was released the same year as C.S.I. premiered on TV (2000), and the solving of its central mystery -- discovering the identity of the skeleton they nickname Sailor -- may have been a more fascinating read at the time: who among us now doesn't assume that a lab full of specialists can crack any crime from the minutest of evidence? As Anil and Sarath analyse soil, insect pupae, and pollen, the reader is confident that the dead man's hometown will be discovered, and even Anil's deduction of his occupation from bone stress and an artist's reconstruction of his face from a skull seems just a day at the office anymore. If only one could go back in time before this storyline became clich\u00e9. But while this mystery might be the central framework for this book, it's not really what it's about.Ondaatje writes in disjointed scenes, where characters reveal more about themselves through the stories that they tell than by their present actions. Some stories in Anil's Ghost are tacked on at the beginning of chapters, unrelated to the action -- like the young teacher who passed the same group of teenaged boys every morning on her way to school until one day all she saw of them were their heads stuck on poles -- and other stories are used to illuminate the main point, as in this recounting of an artist who paints the eyes on Buddha statues:\nHe climbs a ladder in front of the statue. The man with him climbs too. This has taken place for centuries, you realize, there are records of this since the ninth century. The painter dips a brush into the paint and turns his back to the statue, so it looks as if he is about to be enfolded in its great arms. The paint is wet on the brush. The other man, facing him, holds up the mirror, and the artificer puts the brush over his shoulder and paints in the eyes without looking directly at the face. He uses just the reflection to guide him -- so only the mirror receives the direct image of the glance being created. No human eye can meet the Buddha's during the process of creation.\nSo, too, does it seem that no one, not Ondaatje and not the characters that he creates, is willing to be direct with the truth of the Sri Lankan Civil War (and the government's culpability) : a mirror is held up to events and an atmosphere, rather than facts, are revealed. There is much space between the various stories and much isolation felt by the characters: Sarath and his brother Gamini are not only estranged from each other, but both have been left by their wives; Anil is unmarried, has recently left her lover, and risks losing her best friend; Sarath's mentor, Palipani, has become a hermit after a public disgrace; the artist, Ananda, has become a drunk after the disappearance of his wife. There is distrust and fear and language barriers between characters, yet meanwhile, truck drivers are hauled from their vehicles and crucified to the pavement, a young miner is branded an insurgent at the say-so of a hooded accuser, bodies turn up at the morgue with their faces destroyed by acid, and something must be done.\nThere were dangers in handing truth to an unsafe city around you. As an archaeologist, Sarath believed in truth as a principle. That is, he would have given his life for the truth if the truth were of any use.\nIn Anil's Ghost, Ondaatje hands out the truth, paints in the Buddha's eyes, and while he may do so indirectly, using a mirror and painting over his shoulder, those eyes will last for generations; bearing silent witness. I enjoyed this book very much, but recognise that it would not be for everyone. Remember when Elaine seemed to be the only one who hated the movie made of Ondaatje's The English Patient?It's okay to be an Elaine."}, {"userName": "Sorayya Khan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2683005-sorayya-khan", "userReview": "Ondaatje transports us to Sri Lanka in a time during the 1980's and 1990's when the government was embroiled in a civil war that produced a reign of terror and plenty of dead and disappeared people. Anil returns to her homeland as a forensic expert and representative of an international human rights organization. In a plot that is a bit mystery but so much more, we come to know Anil and Sarath (an archeologist), along with secondary characters like Ananda (artist extraordinaire) and Gamini (Sarath's brother and a doctor). We see the cost of the war and a chronicle of lives lived in the remains of skeletons, for example ankle bones that reveal work in mines. We see brothers torn and bound by familial love, a young woman trying to make sense of her identity and what it might mean to love, and a society charged with the fear that is essential to war. We see doctors who are forced to work for opposing sides in the war, yet go about their days saving their enemies as they would their families. Anil's Ghost paints a picture, the outlines of which are finally hazy as they blur into our notion of war and its reckoning.There are also lots of asides that are really insertions of historical facts. Did you know that if you place a stone on the earth above a ribcage of a corpse to act as a marker, it takes nine years for the stone to fall into the ribcage? There were \"halls for the sick\" in what is now Sri Lanka four centuries before Christ? And an archeological site in China: underneath stone slabs, rows of timber were cut and stripped as if for a floor, but it was a ceiling, and when the timber was removed, a water tomb was discovered, three pools of underground water. I don't know how Ondaatje does it, because the narrative is really a bit of a muddle. A back and forth pulled along by a moving narrative, but jumpy all the same. Do we need to know so much about Anil's one-time lover, Cullis? Or Palipana, Sarath's teacher? (The Grove of Ascetics, the section that describes Sarath and Anil meeting Palipana is beautiful, though.) Also, there are italicized sections here and there and their relevance wasn't always clear to me nor how they fit with what preceded or what followed them. But my focus on the narrative's jumpiness might be because structure fascinates me. I'm always trying to learn from how a novelist puts together a story, how it's presented to us and when the rationale isn't crystal clear, it's frustrating because I feel I'm not seeing something that I should. Ondaatje's language is beautiful and there are passages and sentences that took my breath away, not always for their beauty but for their clarity and ability to convey something profound in few words. Remembering a few:\"The hospital would run out of painkillers during the first week of any offensive. You were without self in those times, lost among the screaming.\"\"Gamini rarely saw himself from the point of view of a stranger. Though most people knew who he was, he felt he was invisible to those around him. The woman therefore slid alongside him and clattered about in the almost empty house of his heart. She became, as she had done that night of the operation, the sole accompanist to what he thought, what he worked on.\"\"I love history, the intimacy of entering all those landscapes. Like entering a dream. Someone nudges a stone away and there's a story.\"\"When he wrote, he slipped into the page as if it were water, and tumbled on. The writer was a tumbler. (Would he remember that?) If not, then a tinker, carrying a hundred pots and pans and bits of linoleum and wires and falconer's hoods and pencils and . . . you carried them around for years and gradually fit them into a small, modest book. The art of packing.\"\"American movies, English books--remember how they all end?\" Gamini asked that night. \"The American or the Englishman gets on a plane and leaves. That's it. The camera leaves with him. He looks out of the window at Mombasa or Vietnam or Jakarta, someplace now he can look at through the clouds. The tired hero. A couple of words to the girl beside him. He's going home. So the war, to all purposes, is over. That's enough reality for the West. It's probably the history of the last two hundred years of Western political writing. Go home. Write a book. Hit the circuit.\""}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "Writing a classic war novel is never easy, of course, but consider the audience that awaited Stephen Crane's \"Red Badge of Courage\" in 1895. Every reader in America was still living in the shadow of the Civil War.Similarly, when Erich Maria Remarque released \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" in 1929, there was a whole planet waiting to make sense of World War I.Unfortunately, the West is not waiting for a novel about the civil war in Sri Lanka. But Michael Ondaatje is about to put this tragedy on the map of Western consciousness with \"Anil's Ghost.\"His last book, \"The English Patient,\" won England's Booker Prize in 1992, and the interminable movie version won an Academy Award for best picture in 1997. On the strength of that success, millions of readers will pick up \"Anil's Ghost\" no matter what it's about.They won't be disappointed.The situation in Sri Lanka is a novelist's jungle. The conflict has been raging for 16 years, has claimed 60,000 lives, and has already decimated large parts of the island nation off the coast of India. Clashing politicians, rebel groups, and religious traditions could easily tangle this book in a thicket of details that only those well-versed in Sri Lankan politics could follow. But Ondaatje has not set out to record his homeland's modern history.Instead, \"Anil's Ghost\" focuses on the emotional complexities of living in a country beset by political terror. The effect is at once gorgeous and ghastly.Through the center of the book runs the gripping story of Anil Tissera, a forensic anthropologist who returns to Sri Lanka under the auspices of an international human rights group. When she left 15 years before, she was a bashful hero, lionized for her remarkable strength as a swimmer. On her return, she needs all that strength and more to traverse the waves of fear that have been crashing over her homeland.As the invited guest of a regime widely suspected of carrying out mass murders and torture, Anil works in a precarious situation. Her government-appointed partner, a local archaeologist named Sarath Diyasena, gives her little reason to relax. The two of them retreat with the first selection of bodies to a makeshift laboratory in the dark cargo hold of an abandoned luxury liner. You'll have to remind yourself to keep breathing as you read this book.There are any number of fresh subjects being unearthed daily, but they choose to concentrate on a skeleton that appears to have been reburied in a government-controlled area.It's gruesome work - quixotic and suicidal - but both Anil and Sarath are determined to pursue the truth of this single, representative atrocity. Ondaatje's voice, alternately calm and impressionistic, is perfect for conveying such horrors in a relentless series of short chapters: \"On this island, she realized she was moving with only one arm of language among uncertain laws and a fear that was everywhere. There was less to hold on to with that one arm. Truth bounced between gossip and vengeance. Rumour slipped into every car and barbershop.\"Breaking through the culture of fear-enforced silence proves as difficult as determining a victim's identify from his burned remains. They seek assistance from an old man drunk on grief and alcohol who is one of the few artists entrusted to paint the eyes on statues of Buddha. This mystical act of bringing a god's eyes to life becomes a haunting symbol in a novel about hidden crimes.Laced through this central detective story are anecdotes from the characters' pasts, scenes from elsewhere on the island, and random acts of violence. All these characters are quiet, desperate people, addicted to their work or their grief. Ondaatje is a master at portraying unconsummated desire - for love, truth, or peace.http://www.csmonitor.com/2000/0504/p1..."}, {"userName": "Darryl", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3528864-darryl", "userReview": "\"There are so many bodies in the ground now, that's what you said...murdered, anonymous. I mean, people don't even know if they are two hundred years old or two weeks old, they've all been through fire. Some people let their ghosts die, some don't. Sarath, we can do something...\"Anil Tissera was born in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, to a prosperous family, where she achieved a small degree of fame by winning a notable swimming race as a school girl. She left at 18 to attend medical school in England, and she later trained to become a forensic pathologist there and in the United States. After a brief failed marriage and the early deaths of her parents she is rootless and restless, despite her successful career. She applies and, to her surprise, is accepted as a forensic specialist for an international human rights organization that plans to send a team to Sri Lanka in the late 1980s, during the height of the country's civil war. The government is engaged in fierce and bloody battles with the Tamil Tigers to the north and with separatist insurgent forces to the south simultaneously, and the bodies of thousands of soldiers on all sides and innocent civilians caught in the middle have been turning up with alarming frequency throughout the country. Intense international pressure is put upon the Sri Lankan president to investigate the claims of atrocities by the government and the rebels, and he reluctantly agrees to an investigation, while he and other officials vehemently deny that the Sri Lankan Army is involved in the torture and slaughter of insurgents and civilians.It has been 15 years since Anil left her homeland, and Sri Lanka is both familiar and distant to her. She is paired with Sarath, a local archeologist who acts as both an older guide and as a temporizing influence on her inpatient tendencies. Later she meets Sarath's younger brother Gamini, an emergency medicine physician who is haunted by his experiences caring for hundreds of patients with traumatic injuries and seeing nearly as many corpses in the hospital's morgue.Anil and Sarath come upon an ancient burial ground, and they discover a body that doesn't seem to fit with the others. Anil suspects that it has been placed there recently, and since soldiers guard the site she and Sarath conclude that the man, a local resident who has been brutally tortured before his death, was killed by government forces. Sarath senses the extreme danger of this discovery, and urges Anil to act cautiously, but she is outraged and insists that the government, the Sri Lankan people, and the international community must know what is happening there. Anil's Ghost begins slowly, as Ondaatje carefully creates a rich tapestry of the lives of the main characters and teaches the reader about the essential techniques of archeology and forensic pathology, which was occasionally of little interest to me. However, the tension and drama progressively build throughout the second half of the book up to its momentous ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, but I was left with several unanswered questions, particularly about the motivations and fates of the three main characters that cannot be discussed in this review."}], "description": "Anil's Ghost transports us to Sri Lanka, a country steeped in centuries of tradition, now forced into the late twentieth century by the ravages of a bloody civil war.
