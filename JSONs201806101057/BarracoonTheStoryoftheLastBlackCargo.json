She was a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance, producing works of fiction in addition to her anthropological work. Cudjo at home \u2013 from History.com - (Credit: Erik Overbey Collection, The Doy Leale McCall Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of South Alabama)It was during this period that she first met the last known black man transported from Africa to America as a slave, Cudjoe Lewis. She interviewed Lewis, then in his 80s, in 1927, producing a 1928 article about his experiences, Cudjoe\u2019s Own Story of the Last American Slaver. There were some issues with that report, including a serious charge of plagiarism. Hurston returned to Lewis in Africatown, Alabama, to interview him at length. It is these interviews that form the bulk of her book, Barracoon, plagiarism no longer being at issue.Zora Neale Hurston - image from SmithsonianHer efforts to publish the book ran into some cultural headwind, publishers refused to proceed so long as her subject\u2019s dialogue was presented in his idiomatic speech. Thurston refused to remove this central element of the story, and so the book languished. But the Zora Neale Trust did not give up, and a propitious series of events seemed to signal that the time was right \nLast fall, on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots, the musician Questlove learned that he descends from people brought over on the Clotilda. Then an Alabama reporter named Ben Raines found a wreck that looked to be the scuttled ship; it wasn\u2019t, but the story made national news\u2026.[while] Kossola\u2019s relevance goes beyond any headlines, [there are also] noteworthy links there: one of Kossola\u2019s sons is killed by law enforcement, and his story holds a message about recognizing humanity echoed by Black Lives Matter. - from Time Magazine articleThen there is the story itself. Hurston gets out of the way, acting mostly as Cudjoe\u2019s stenographer and editor, reporting his words as he spoke them. It is a harrowing tale. A young village man in 1859, Kossula (his true name) was in training to learn military skills when his community was attacked by a neighboring tribe. His report of the attack is graphic, and gruesome. Many of those who survived the crushing assault were dragged away and sold to white slave traders. (Definitely not their choice, Kanye) We learn of his experiences while awaiting his transportation, his telling of the Middle Passage, arrival in America and his five years as a slave. He tells, as well, of the establishment of Africatown, after the Civil War ended the Peculiar Institution in the United States, and of the travails of his life after that, having and losing children, running up against the so-called legal system, but also surviving to tell his tale, and gaining respect as a storehouse of history and folklore. This is an upsetting read, rage battles grief as we learn of the hardships and unfairness of Kossula\u2019s life. \n\u201cOh Lor\u2019, I know it you call my name. Nobody don\u2019t callee me Kossula, jus\u2019 lak I in de Affica soil!\u201d\nThe book stands out for many reasons. Among them is that it is one of very few reports of slavery from the perspective of the slave. There are many documents available that recorded the transactions that involved human cargo, and many reports by slavers, but precious little has been heard from the cargo itself. It is also a significant document in teaching us about the establishment of Africatown, a village set up not by African Americans, but by Africans, Cudjoe and his fellow former slaves. The stories Cudjoe tells are often those he learned in his home culture. 'The Brookes' Slave Ship Diagram \u2013 from the British LibraryBarracoon is a triumph of ethnography, bringing together not only a first-person report on experiences in African slave trading, but reporting on slavery from a subject of that atrocity. In addition Kossula adds his triumphant account of joining with other freed slaves to construct an Africa-like community in America, and offers as well old-world folklore in the stories he recalls from his first nineteen years. It is a moving tale for Hurston\u2019s sensitive efforts to reach across the divide of time to encourage Kossula to relive some of the darkest moments any human can experience, sitting with him, calm, caring, and connecting. And finally, it is a truly remarkable tale Kossula tells. It will raise your blood pressure, horrify you, and encourage bursts of tears. You think you\u2019ve had it tough? And for this man to have endured with such dignity and grace is a triumph all its own. Commemorative Marker for Cudjo Lewis \u2013 Plateau Cemetery, Africatown, Mobile, AL - image from wikiThe text of the story is short, but Kossula\u2019s tale is epic. Editor Deborah G. Plant has added a wealth of supportive material, including parables and old-world stories Kossula told to his descendants and to residents of Africatown, a description of a children\u2019s game played in his home town in Africa, and background material on Hurston, her professional issues with an earlier piece of work, and her involvement with the Harlem Renaissance, without touching much on Hurston\u2019s unexpected political perspective on segregation. The information adds to our appreciation of the book. Cudjo with great-grand-daughters twins Mary and Martha, born in 1923 - image from Doy Leale McCall Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of South AlabamaThe ethnographical research Hurston did bolstered a perspective on African culture that different was not inferior, that African culture had great value, regardless of those who believed only in Western superiority. Long before Jesse Jackson, such research proclaimed \u201cI am somebody.\u201d The research Hurston did in the USA, Caribbean and Central America certainly informed and strengthened the portraits she painted in her fiction writing. The history of slavery is a dark one, however much light has been shone on it in the last century and a half. This moving, upsetting telling of a life that endured it is a part of that history. That this 80-year-old nugget has been buried under the weight of time is a shame. But there is an upside. The pressure of all those years has created something glistening and wonderful for us today, a diamond of a vision into the past.

To deny him his language is to deny his history, to deny his experience \u2014 which ultimately is to deny him, period.

That the book has now finally come to be published IS of course wonderful. It should have been published decades and decades ago!BUT, but, but\u2026 I do have some complaints with the final product.Only half of this book is in fact Cudjo Lewis' story, his story, told by him. Zora Neale Hurston was absolutely right in demanding that his voice should be heard and that he was to be allowed to speak in his own dialect. Cudjo Lewis was the last known survivor of the Atlantic slave trade. He was captured by a rival tribe in 1859 and sold into slavery. Oluale Kossola, renamed Cudjo Lewis by the plantation owner who bought him in 1860, spent three weeks in a stockade (a barracoon) and was shipped to America on the last slave ship, the Clotilda. Born in 1841, he came to America at 19 years of age, was a slave for five years and six months and then was freed by Yankee soldiers on April 12, 1865. In Africa he was one of twelve siblings, the second son of his father\u2019s second wife. In America, he married, had six children, all of whom died as well as his wife before his own death. He converted to Christianity and after a train accident became a sexton in a Baptist church in Africa Town, a.k.a. Plateau, Alabama. First in July of 1927, then in December and finally 1928, he came to be interviewed by Zora Neale Hurston, cultural anthropologist, investigating ethnographer and author. She had been \u201csent by Dr. Franz Boas to get a firsthand report of the raid that had brought him to America and bondage, for Dr. Carter G. Woodson of the Journal of Negro History.\u201d Cudjo was then eighty-six and had lived in America for sixty-seven years! Zora let Cudjo speak\u2014in his own time and in his own way. On a doorstep, on a porch, after sweeping the church, after introducing his two great grandchildren and sending them each off with peaches in their hands, Cudjo would talk and remember and Zora would listen, only rarely interposing a question, enjoying a peach, a hunk of watermelon and time together. These interviews and Cujo\u2019s remembrances are the core of this book, but they are only about half of the entire book. The other half consists of multiple prefaces and introductions and an appendix. The first introduction is written by Deborah G. Plaint. Thereafter follows a preface and introduction by Zora Neale Hurston. In this way material comes to be repeated over and over and over again. There exists an unresolved discussion of whether Zora Neale Hurston had plagiarized information from Emma Langdon Roche's Historic Sketches of the South. While I agree that this had to be included, the many details, rather than clarifying, leave the issue still open to debate. Why Hurston\u2019s book, completed in 1931, was not published is also discussed, the primary reason being she insisted on retaining Cudjo\u2019s original dialect and vernacular. The appendix at the end has assorted stories, the value of which can be questioned. We hear Cudjo\u2019s story and we hear it in his words, which has great value, but do not mistakenly think you will be given Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s prose. All though the telling is straightforward, a reader / a listener must perceive what this poor man has gone through\u2014the loss of his entire family, the loss of his country and home, the loss of freedom and the horrific memories of the slaughter of his tribesmen and passage over the sea. His words as well as his silences speak. In print, the dialect could perhaps be hard to follow, but this is not the case when Robin Miles reads the audiobook! I never had trouble understanding the text! The African names were a bit of a blur, since I recognized nothing. The dialect and vernacular does demand one\u2019s full attention while listening. The narration I have given four stars.This is a story that needed to be told, but the presentation is repetitive, much reads as an academic essay and some information is in fact missing. We are not told when or how Cudjo died. I do not regret having picked this up. My two star rating means it was OK, not bad! I am off to read, Their Eyes Were Watching God, only now finally made available to me! I gave Dust Tracks on a Road three stars."}, {"userName": "Naori", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/839866-naori", "userReview": "I have thought long and hard on this and I do not feel like I can give this any formal review. This is a case in which I feel I would be trespassing on the author\u2019s words, and by this I mean Kossulo\u2019s, by superimposing any thoughts of my own. There are pieces of history we will never get back. For many of us, this is why we write: to re-imagine the stories of slavery, for instance, because we do not have words to tell us. This is a living, breathing document and should be treated as such. Just like the recordings of the stories of the final survivors of the Holocaust, we cannot rewrite their stories. We can only let their words echo inside of us and understand how they are a part of us, as we are a part of that part of history we created. Such are the words of Cudjo. He says many times in the book that there is no way to understand his life if he doesn\u2019t tell the lives of his forefathers. At one point when Zora gets frustrated with this he retorts, \u201cWhere is de house where de mouse is the leader?\u201d (20). This is how we all must understand the unfathomable meaning of this text for us RIGHT NOW. We cannot pretend to care about any of the critical social and political issues of today, we can\u2019t march in the streets, hold rallies, go on social media, start movements - if we aren\u2019t willing to look into our past and see where this is all coming from. It doesn\u2019t matter what you believe in, what you care about or don\u2019t care about, where you live or what age you are. This is a piece of history we can never get back, and this was a historical reality that a great deal of the world participated in, or still does. Everyone needs to read this book.

While the work is heavily prefaced with discourse on Hurston's process of coming into the writing of this novel (and claims of plagiarism), Cudjo's story itself is only 94 pages. The tail end of the book contains an extensive appendix with stories, endnotes, and other items pertinent to the work.Emotionally, I despaired at Cudjo's longing to return to his native land and be among people he knew and loved. His parting from all that was familiar made me sick to my stomach--it is truly unfathomable. Academically, I imagine this work will become an essential piece--if not in its entirety, then in excerpt-form--in high school and collegiate classrooms across the world. Hurston composed the work based on her interviews with Cudjo Lewis between 1927-30 and was never granted publication in her time because publishers felt the use of vernacular would be off-putting to readers; a sentiment she obviously did not agree with, as she refused to change the work in order to achieve publication.

He was the last surviving African of the last American slaver-the ClotildaBarracoon: The Story of the Last \u2018Black Cargo\u2019 is a previously unpublished work by author Zora Neale Hurston. Although she is best known for her works of fiction, in this book, she writes \u2018as a cultural anthropologist, ethnographer, and folklorist\u2019. In 1927, Hurston spent three months in Plateau, Alabama interviewing Cudjo Lewis, 90, the last known survivor of the Atlantic slave trade. Hurston records much of Lewis\u2019 story in his own words and dialect as he talks of his capture in 1860 by another African tribe; his sale to and detention by American slavers in a barracoon, an enclosure used to detain slaves; his transport to the United States with more than a hundred other people on the Clotilde, the last American ship to conduct this \u2018illegitimate trade\u2019; the horrors of his five and a half years as a slave \u2018from 1860 until Union soldiers told him he was free\u2019; and his life after, the desire for land, the building of Africatown, the lives and deaths of his wife and children, and his constant sense of loss and yearning for his home in Africa. Lewis is a born storyteller making his story fascinating, often horrifying, and poignant. Despite his age, his memory is excellent and, as Deborah G. Plant points out in the introduction, if he gets minor details wrong, his story overall matches objectively known facts. Hurston intersperses his tale with comments about their relationship, the gifts she brings him, the food they share, her growing respect for him, and his emotions as he remembers the life that was stolen from him. She tells it all with compassion and empathy. Barracoon is an important work by one of America\u2019s most important writers. It provides a rare and powerful glimpse at the true horrors and tragedy of slavery as experienced by someone who lived through it.

He was brought to America illegally, at the tail end of slavery. His owners kept him and his shipmate slaves \"secret\" between them, using their labours for about 6 years before slavery was abolished. These people were then abandoned to a life in America, a place they did not see as home, with no way back to the home they wanted to return to. Free life in America was hard on African-born freed slaves. They were shunned, it seems, by both White & Black Americans. This is a side of slavery that I personally had never thought of: the plight of the last slaves who always remembered another life. Cudjo's story was horrendous from the treachery he experienced from other African tribes who benefitted from the slave trade to his attempts at living in America as a free man. He's a quiet man. He went through horrible times. He lived a long life, always yearning for \"Affica\"."}, {"userName": "Kimberley", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6597039-kimberley", "userReview": "There are some who\u2019ll choose to lock-in on the accuracy of the text: how much of the story was embellished, or helped along, by Hurston?

To me, none of that matters. It\u2019s irrelevant and petty to even address the how of this work, as it only stands to negate (and belittle) the importance of Cudjo\u2019s story. Lewis (also referred to as Kossola) emotionally relays his story of being sold out by countrymen, stolen away by ship to a foreign land (on a despicable bet), forced into five and a half years of slavery, set free, but made to adapt in a country he never wanted to call \u201chome\u201d in the first place\u2014without the benefit of being awarded his own property or even offered a proper education\u2014then made to endure years of injustice via the questionable deaths of his sons, the loss of his physical well-being, and the agony of being ostracized by not only whites, but blacks as well. Through it all, he managed to carve out a semblance of a life. His strength, andperseverance, despite all the wrong he endured, should be THE STORY. Not some nonsensical debate over who actually wrote it first. Anyone that chooses to quibble over that particularly aspect is selling Cudjo short.

It is rare that we have a narrative of one who remembers and recounts the journey from Africa to America, from free person to enslaved man. So, Zora Neale Hurston writing and working as a folklorist and cultural anthropologist took interest in the story of Kossula, the last surviving individual from the last slaving ship that touched down in Alabama in 1860, the Clotilda. Here we have the remembrances from the perspective of the captive. As Zora says; \u201cAll these words from the seller, but not one word from the sold. The Kings and Captains whose words moved ships. But not one word from the cargo. The thoughts of the \u201cblack ivory,\u201d the \u201ccoin of Africa,\u201d had no market value. She was on a mission to give value to the words of the sold and she did just that over a series of conversations with Kossula.\u201cI had met Cudjo Lewis (his American name) for the first time in July 1927. I was sent by Dr. Franz Boas to get a firsthand report of the raid that had brought him to America and bondage, for Dr. Carter G.\u00a0Woodson of the Journal of Negro History. I had talked with him in December of that same year and again in 1928.\u201d The book is written in the vernacular dialect style and it takes a bit to get used to the rhythm, but once you fall in, you will remain locked to the page. I\u2019m guessing Nora was aiming for authenticity and trying to present Kossula to the world the exact way she was hearing it. This might account, in some small way for the time between writing and publishing. The book was completed in 1931 and has just now, almost a century later been published. At least one publisher asked for Kossula\u2019s life story in \u201clanguage rather than dialect...... Hurston would not submit to such revision.\u201dAlthough slave narratives are in publication, Kossula\u2019s story takes us from his African home through three weeks in the barracoon (essentially a holding hut for the captives before they were loaded onto ships) to 45 days at sea and then dry land in Alabama. He spent five years in bondage before emancipation came. The majority of slave narratives in print detail their bondage here in America but rarely, if ever? have we had an intimate look from the motherland to America.Through these conversations, you can glimpse the culture and ways of being.\t\t\u201cDe ole folks, you unnerstand me, de wise ones, dey go out in de woods and gittee leaves\u2014dey know which ones\u2014an\u2019 mashee de leaves wid water. Den dey paint de dead man all over wid dis so he doan spoil till de king come. Maybe de king doan git dere till de next day. When de king come, my grandfather, he come wid him. \u201cBefo\u2019 anybody see de king, we know he is almost dere, because we hear de drum.\u201dThe capture is given a detailed accounting but the middle passage is not discussed in depth, perhaps due to the harshness of memories. One thing that Kossula makes abundantly clear is the sense of loss and longing he always felt for his home. Deborah Plant does a masterful job setting the stage in her informative introduction that gives depth surrounding this project. There was some talk of plagiarism because Zora didn\u2019t properly cite some sources she used for some of the folklore backgrounds. Seems to be, much ado about nothing.Zora\u2019s talent as a writer was already shining as the reader will see here. This book was completed in 1931 and Her Eyes Were Watching God wasn\u2019t published until 1937, her most famous work. This is a work that belongs on every shelf. Even the appendix and glossary contain valuable tidbits. \u201cIn spite of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the people on the continent, Europeans and Americans referred to them, collectively, as \u201cAfricans.\u201d This resulted in the belief that \u201c\u2018Africans\u2019 sold their own sisters and brothers.\u201d I think it\u2019s important for the discussion of slavery that we make clear and conscious distinctions between perpetrators, collaborators, and victims.

This book and story was absolutely incredible and left me with so many thoughts and feelings. In Hurston's introduction she states, \"All these words from the seller, but not one word from the sold. The Kings and Captains whose words move ships. But not one word from the cargo. The thoughts of the 'black ivory', the 'coin of Africa', had no market value. Africa's ambassadors to the New World have come and worked and died, and left their spoors, but no recorded thought.\" To think that OUR stories have been told by the oppressor but not from the mouths of our very own (until now) is simply mind blowing. Kossola and his history has easily become one of my favorites so far. Although it was a primary reason for not being published for so long, I loved that Hurston kept the dialect as he spoke it. I had the opportunity to listen to the audiobook as I turned the pages of this historical piece and followed along. Robin Miles did an impeccable job bringing this story to life. \"You unnerstand me\" has easily become my favorite phrase of the entire book. This being one of the first slavery books I've had the chance to read, it left me wanting to know more. Africans people being sold by their own people and stolen from their homeland is a concept that still seems unreal to me. It's nice to hear a story from the perspective of the stolen and his account of how it happened, hashing out the details (as he remembers it) of the journey that brought him to American soil.

She originally interviewed Cudjo Lewis at the behest of Dr. Franz Boas. Her report was meant for the Journal of Negro History. She would return and interview him over three months at his home in Alabama, learning of his journey from Africa, his life in bondage and his eventual freedom. This book is told through the words of Oluale Kossola, the man history now knows as Cudjo Lewis. He had been in the United States for over sixty years at the time this interview took place. Hurston tells this story with little of her own interjections and this allowed his passion for his home to come through. Regardless of the time that had passed, he still valued the memories of being in \u201cAffica.\u201d It was heartbreaking to read his story, to read his description of what life was like in Takkoi. His father a chief, his mother the second wife, his siblings with him always. Then the deaths that took place when the Dahomey came and captured so many, taking them to the ships that would eventually take them to America. Then the realization that he was no longer a free man, in a land he had never known. Only to be given his freedom and have no way of returning home. I appreciated the fact that Hurston allowed his words to shine through, inflections and all. It grounded Kossola\u2019s story in a brutal reality. To know and remember your home and to find yourself in a land so brutal and so foreign from your own is heart-wrenching. This is a really short book but it highlights the brutality of the slave trade. And not just the transatlantic journey, Kossola\u2019s capture and separation from all he knew was bloody and disturbing. I would recommend this book. This narrative told by a man who was once enslaved that includes his life in Africa is rare. The introduction to this book holds quite a bit of information, most regarding a controversy regarding the original report on Cudjo, and accusations of plagiarism on behalf of Hurston.  But overall, I enjoyed this, as a biography. This book was much less about Hurston's beautiful prose and narrative and more about a man stripped from his home, chained and eventually freed. I can\u2019t stress how important that is and how mind-blowing the circumstances are when you consider the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade was supposed to have been abolished. And yet, the Clotilda made its passage and here we have the story of Cudjo. Now it must be stated that not everything in this book is accurate. Later research into the story of the Clotilda and Cudjo Lewis, will show that some of what is written was based off the research that Hurston conducted at the time. Research not available to her corrects certain aspects of the story, like the name of the town Cudjo was from, and aspects of the tribe that captured him. Nothing, that I know of, disproves the facts of his experiences as relayed to Hurston.

In this work of non-fiction, Zora Neale Hurston conveys the life story of Kossola, known as Cudjo Lewis, \"the last surviving African of the last American slaver\" (xi). Born in 1841 in West Africa, Kossola was captured by a neighboring tribe and sold to white slavers in 1860 at the age of 19. He was a slave for five years before being freed and he lived out the rest of his life in Plateau, Alabama. Hurston met with him in 1927 over several months to record his life story. It is clear from Hurston's narration of her time with Cudjo that she was not always welcomed by him. At times he seems frustrated that she has come or is unwilling to talk about his painful past. Therefore, rather than interview him exhaustively, she gives him the space to talk as he wishes; \"Rather than insert herself into the narrative as the learned and probing cultural anthropologist, the investigating ethnographer, or the authorial writer, Zora Neale Hurston, in her still listening, assumes the office of a priest\" (xxxiii). Cudjo's story as told to Hurston is important because of the millions that made the passage to America and were enslaved, this is one of only a handful of such recorded stories of that experience. He helps give voice to those who never got to tell their stories and the thousands who are disremembered. Indeed, accounts of Middle Passage are so rare that Deborah G. Plant states in the introduction that their are \"no known accounts by deported African women of their experience before, during, and after the Middle Passage\" (xxxvii). Cudjo's story is of course remarkably sad and full of tragedies, from the loss of his whole family and country of birth, to struggles both before and after he won his freedom, and the loss of his children after he did mange to make a new family in America. His is a brief narrative and there were so many sections that I would have liked more detail on, such as the polygamous nature of his home country, his family in Africa, what living conditions were like for him as a slave, and more details about his wife's background and life. Although I found the vernacular writing style that Hurston chose hard to read and I wish yet more details had been captured, this was a valuable work that we are lucky to have, as it illuminates a painful yet important part of our country's history."}, {"userName": "Janilyn Kocher", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10091550-janilyn-kocher", "userReview": "A very interesting read about a previously unpublished manuscript by Zora Neale Hurston. I thought the introduction was very good. It reveals the story behind the story and tells more about Hurston, who I just knew very basic information. The dialect is disjointed and difficult to read at times. It's a fascinating tale of one of the last known incidents of contraband slaves brought to the US. Cudjo suffered many losses in his life and was quirky, but Hurston persevere to get his story. One aspect that was missing was when he actually passed away. The story ends and there was no epilogue.

So that was my initial draw to the book, learning about the slave trade and slavery from a man interviewed in the 1930s who had experienced it. Then to further learn that this was Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s work that had gone unpublished was another astounding fact about it. Hurston maintained the dialect of her interviewee, and that takes some getting used to, but it was enough like the WPA interviews with former slaves that it didn\u2019t take long to acclimate. This poor man. There are moments where he recounts how he was captured and torn from his family, and he drifts away with his thoughts, staring at the fire. And later on he tells of all the deaths in his family formed here in the States and you wonder how this man could go on.

Ultimately, Barracoon was not what I expected. First, it was much shorter than what I imagined Cudjo Lewis' story would need. This is an important story. There is no doubt about that. I just didn't feel as though I got enough of it, like Hurston maybe didn't include everything, or something was lost somewhere. Cudjo Lewis was a difficult subject to interview, as some days he did not feel like talking, which was entirely his right. Maybe that hindered the book. Second, the introduction was a drawn out academic essay that used some of the most impactful quotes from the text, spoiling them for later. It also concerned itself a great deal with detailing how Hurston had written a shorter piece about Lewis which has since been under the microscope and people believe she plagiarized. Why a book celebrating Hurston's legacy and putting forth some of her early work would spend so much time on possibly dismantling her image is beyond me. Nella Larsen's career was ruined because of something similar. Sure, mention it, but writing pages upon pages about her lack of citations when she was just beginning to publish was annoying. What does it matter now? Lewis' life was tragic, but there seemed to be much that he wanted to remember. He told Hurston his story, with traditions and folk tales weaved throughout. At the end of the day, I enjoyed the major part of this book, and its appendix. However, I will say that I could tell it was Hurston's first large project. Her later anthropological titles seem to be more complete and focused.

Despite being written in Cudjo\u2019s dialect, the stories are a surprisingly easy (and quick) read. Hurston intersperses the stories with explanations of her visits with him.

I loved that book and I still love it and I connect with it so much. It's a masterpiece in my eyes. Despite this, I know there are a bunch of people out there who didn't love it as much as I did (mainly disgruntled English students forced to read it). But me? I loved it. I loved how the unique vernacular really made you read the book and how everything came in threes. Because of this, I was so excited to hear that a new Hurston novel was coming out post-mortem. And even though reviewing literary fiction etc. isn't really in my lane, I wanted a chance at this. And in some ways, it was such a wonderful and nostalgic experience to read this. We got to see that signature vernacular in the novel and it really let me focus on Cudjo's story. And it's such a meaningful and important story, as the story of the last \"black cargo\" would suggest. Although the style was different than Their Eyes Were Watching God--it was a story of Zora talking about going to interview Cudjo and what Cudjo said, so at the beginning of each chapter it would usually be Zora recalling what was happening or what she and Cudjo were doing when he told her this--it was nice to see something of a different style while still staying true to that message. I also loved the short stories at the end, the ones Zora recorded which Cudjo told her. I wish they had been incorporated in the story more, but I still really enjoyed reading them. I guess what my biggest problem was how little of it there was. For a book that's just a little bit over 200 pages, there's not a lot of Hurston's actual writing. The first third of the book is forewords and prefaces and all sorts of introduction and historical background. Although I found this to be really interesting (such as when Zora was going to have this published but broke off the contract because they wanted to change the vernacular too much) and provide valuable info on the text, it did feel like it took forever to get to Hurston's piece. The second third was the interview-like story with Cudjo and Zora. This was delightful. And the last third of the book was a couple of the short stories Cudjo told that Zora recorded, and then an afterword, notes, etc. etc. There were a lot of things I skimmed past, although they would be very interesting when looked at in detail. I just wish there was a little more of Hurston's content, although I realize that she can't just come back and write stuff. It felt a wee bit misleading that the summary etc. was so focused on Hurston's piece when it was less than half the novel. Still, I am glad to have read this and I think it provides a really great slice of a really interesting yet terrible time in history.

He was 19 years old when his family was killed, he was taken, on a bet.

Perhaps that is why it took nearly a century for this to be published. Or as Alice Walker writes in her forward, perhaps it\u2019s that African people inflicted slavery on other African people.

Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation\u2019s history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo\u2019s firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo\u2019s past\u2014memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilde, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo\u2019s unique vernacular, and written from Hurston\u2019s perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon brilliantly illuminates the tragedy of slavery and one life forever defined by it.
