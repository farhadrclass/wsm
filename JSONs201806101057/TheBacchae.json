He is so chill.\nDionysus, also called Bacchus, was the god of tit- err I mean grape harvest, wine and theatre. He is the son of Zeus and Semele, a mortal princess of Thebes. This is where Euripides' Bacchae takes place. Semele's family, particularly her sisters, don't believe in the existence of Dionysus. They accused her of lying, essentially implying that she slept with some random mortal. Thebes refuses to honor Dionysus as god and does not give him proper worship. That went about as well as expected.\n Therefore will I prove to him and all the race of Cadmus that I am a god. And when I have set all in order here, I will pass hence to a fresh country, manifesting myself; but if the city of Thebes in fury takes up arms and seeks to drive my votaries from the mountain, I will meet them at the head of my frantic rout. This is why I have assumed a mortal form, and put off my godhead to take man's nature. Dionysus, disguised as a mortal man, comes to the palace, intent on avenging his dead mother. He is accompanied by a band of bacchants, his female worshippers. The city plunges into chaos.

But when I attempt reviews, my tongue turns to ashes in my mouth. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re too old (I\u2019ve reviewed older books), nor because they\u2019re so foundational (I\u2019ve reviewed equally fundamental books). It\u2019s because I strongly suspect that I just don\u2019t get it. It strikes me that the Greek tragedians were trying to accomplish something essentially different from what I\u2019ve come to expect from literature.Greek tragedy has not even the slightest element of suspense. When you read one of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies, you know that it will end badly for the protagonist (and at least a few other people)\u2014otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be a tragedy. But there always seems to be a glimmer of hope, a chance that it could\u2019ve turned out differently. The tragic outcome hinges on the character of the tragic hero; the final result is tragic because of that tantalizing \u201cwhat if?\u201d which lingers in the air as the curtain falls.But in the plays of the Greek tragedians, the story is a fait accompli. Everything happens because of the will of the gods, or the mysterious hand of fate. Every character inexorably fulfills their destiny. The only thing they can do, it seems, is to sing about how awful their situation is. Thus we get line after line of the chorus\u2014interrupting the action like a song in a musical, telling the audience what they already know in sing-song verse.This isn't the fault of the playwrights. Because hardly anybody can read Ancient Greek nowadays, we\u2019re forced to read the plays in translation; and poetry is always sub par in translation. Also, these chorus interludes actually did have music when they were performed; so it\u2019s a bit unfair to judge them merely as poetry. (Imagine if archaeologists dug up a book of Beatles lyrics 2,000 years from now. They would have no idea why the Beatles were such a hit.)Nietzsche thought this aspect of Greek tragedy was the root of its power. In his first published work, The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche spills much ink in describing his love for the unbridled spirit of life in the music of the Greek tragic chorus. For Nietzsche, the very fact that the music wasn\u2019t \u2018realistic\u2019\u2014that it didn\u2019t attempt to portray the facts of life\u2014is what gave it its tremendous power. This is why Nietzsche thought that Euripides was decadent.Euripides is distinguished from Aeschylus and Sophocles precisely for his realism. His plays actually do have that element of unpredictability we\u2019ve come to expect from modern tragedy. We don\u2019t feel that the action is foreordained; that the people are merely acting out the decree of Fate. When his characters give monologues, the poetry doesn\u2019t seem stylized or wooden\u2014like old song-lyrics do. Rather, Euripides seeks to portray the psychology of his protagonists as if they were real people; the final result is more like reading someone's thoughts than reading sing-song poetry.This is not to say that he didn\u2019t include mythological or fantastic elements. Take this play. For a completely illogical reason, the god Dionysus decides to wreak havoc in Thebes. He doesn\u2019t do it for the sake of justice; nor to accomplish some goal. He does it, more or less, on a whim. This is what makes the action of the play so shocking. It\u2019s as if the reader has been dropped in via helicopter down on some battlefield, and is forced to watch the senseless violence.Nietzsche admired, almost worshiped, the Dionysian impulse\u2014the mad impulse to riot, to dance, to sing, to live. He found in the character of Dionysus the solution to everything wrong with Christian morality and the scientific mentality. Nietzsche believed that the drive to divide up the world into good and evil, and to value the literal truth above figurative myth, destroys man\u2019s ability to reach his highest potential. But Euripides sees something much darker and devious in the character of Dionysus. Euripides sees that, once morality and truth are abandoned, one is left only with naked power. And naked power can be used just as easily for wanton destruction as for beneficent creation.So it\u2019s hard for me to agree with Nietzsche and consider Euripides as a decadent playwright. Every one of his plays I\u2019ve so far read has been a dramatic masterpiece; and when you think about them, there\u2019s usually an intriguing lesson to be learned, a thought to be pondered. Aeschylus and Sophocles remain partially veiled in translation; their music, lost to time. But now, I can at least say I\u2019ve found one Greek playwright I \u2018get\u2019."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29176007-jenny", "userReview": "\"[...]\u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0'\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4'\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b8\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2\u00b7 \u03c4'\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd.\""}, {"userName": "David Sarkies", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies", "userReview": "The Ancient Greeks had raves2 May 2013\tWe actually don't have a complete copy of this play though the edition that I read attempts to reconstruct the missing sections (which is mostly at the end) because, as they say, this is a popular play that is regularly performed. This in itself is a strange statement since I have never seen it performed (in fact I have only ever seen one Greek play performed, and that was Oedipus Tyrannous and that was by an amateur theatre group). Mind you, Greek plays tend to be short, meaning that they last generally only as long as about a third of a Shakespeare play (though when they were performed in ancient times, it would usually be along with three others plays).\tThe Bacchae is about change and about the resistance to change and how our attempts to resist change is generally futile. Mind you it is a tragedy and it does have a pretty bloody ending (in that a number of the main characters end up dead, though the progenitor of change, Dionysus, doesn't, but then again he is a god). There are two things that do strike me about this play, the first being how there are reflections of Christianity in it, particularly early Christianity, and the second involves reflections of the modern rave culture. However, before I go into exploring those two aspects of the play I should give a bit of a background so you may understand where I am coming from.\tThe cult of Dionysus was a rather new cult to appear in Ancient Greece, as far as the gods are concerned, and he was not one of the traditional gods of the pantheon. He apparently was introduced through migrations from the north, particularly through Thrace. The cult itself was a mystery cult, meaning that the rituals and celebrations tended to be conducted behind closed doors (and this comes out in the Bacchae, particularly since the main worshippers were women). The celebrations (as also comes out in the Bacchae) generally involved drunken revelries out in the bush.\tThe Bacchae itself is set in the mythical period of Ancient Greece in the city of Thebes. The king of Thebes, Penthius, is concerned about this new cult that has appeared that is seducing all of the women into joining. As such he goes out of his way to attempt to put an end to it, including arresting Dionysus. It is interesting that Dionysus, unlike the gods in many of the other Greek plays, has a major role. Most of the gods in Greek drama tend to only come in at the beginning or the end, either to provide an introduction, or to intervene in a hopeless situation. However Dionysus is one of the major characters in this play.\tAnyway Dionysius, in an attempt to defend his cult (and one wonders if his portrayal here is similar to the charismatic cult leaders that we have seen throughout history) convinces Pentheus to spy on one of the celebrations. However, in a drunken haze, the women in the midst of their celebration mistake Pentheus for an mountain goat, capture him, and tear him to pieces. However, the women do not get away scot free as they are exiled for, well, murder, despite their arguments that they were not in control of their faculties at the time.\tThe idea of the new cult is something that societies have faced throughout time, and it goes to show that the Roman persecution of Christianity is something that is not limited to that particular religion at that particular time. It is interesting to note that in the play Pentheus does not believe that Dionysus is a god, despite certain actions (such as blowing up his palace) that suggest otherwise. Further, the ignorance of the bacchic rites is also similar to Roman ignorance of certain Christian rites, such as the Lord's Supper.\tSome have even suggested that Dionysus is a Christ figure, and the introduction to the play even has some similarities with the virgin birth. For instance, Dionysus is born of a woman but has Zeus as his father (though unlike Christianity, where the term 'conceived of the Holy Spirit' does not indicate a sexual union between God and Mary, where it is clear from this play that there was a sexual union between Zeus and Dionysus' mother, though this can be put down to our failure to understand, or accept, the possibility that conception can occur outside of sexual union, though these days this is changing). More interesting is that Dionysus mother is accused of extra-marital sex, which Mary also faced. Another interesting note is that after Dionysus' birth, Zeus hides him to protect him from being killed by a jealous Hera, which has reflections in the Christ story in that Jesus was spirited off to Egypt to protect himself from the murderous rampages of a jealous king.\tSome might suggest that I am drawing some rather tenuous examples here, but I would argue otherwise. One of the reasons is generally because of the fear of Christians to look outside the box. We are more than happy to accept the Bible, but to consider anything outside of that, particularly with regards to pagan representations (or could they be prophecies) of the Christ, can open up to many probabilities. I guess it has to do with the conservative bent that most Christians have, in that what has been done over hundreds of years has proven itself and anything that is new can be dangerous or even destructive. However, remember what Paul writes in the book of Thessalonians: test everything, hold onto what is good, and reject what is bad. He did not say 'reject everything' but to 'test everything' which includes age old traditions.\tI want to finish off with a comment on the modern rave scene. Okay, the idea of the outdoor rave out in the bush rose out of Britian where, in an attempt to stamp out drug use, the government made raves themselves illegal. However, it could also be suggested that the reason the mystery cults of ancient Greece met out in the bush was because they were also illegal. However (particularly since I have been to raves myself) there is something almost bacchic about the rave. The idea of taking drugs to induce feelings of pleasure, as well as the lights and the sounds adding to that, reflects what was occurring here in the Bacchae. In many cases, the rituals were sensual experiments in pleasure, which is similar to what happens at a rave. This also goes to show that the rave is not something new, but something that has been going on for centuries."}, {"userName": "Moira Russell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1630617-moira-russell", "userReview": "....no, I don't know why Elvis's mugshot is on the cover either."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29176007-jenny", "userReview": "\u038c\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9,\u03b8\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9.\u039b\u03af\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9\u03be\u03b1\u03bd \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc-\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5!"}, {"userName": "Cemre", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11693335-cemre", "userReview": "Bu sefer kolaya ka\u00e7\u0131yorum ve yorum yapmay\u0131p kitaptan benim i\u00e7in kitab\u0131n \u00f6zeti olan iki al\u0131nt\u0131 yapmay\u0131 tercih ediyorum.\"\u0130nsani tutkular tanr\u0131lara yak\u0131\u015fmaz\" (s.62).\"Tanr\u0131lar insanlar\u0131n baht\u0131ndat\u00fcrl\u00fc t\u00fcrl\u00fc g\u00f6sterirler kudretlerini.T\u00fcrl\u00fc hallere sokarlar bizi hi\u00e7 beklenmedik,umdu\u011fumuz \u015feyler olmazummad\u0131\u011f\u0131m\u0131z hallere getirirler bizi.\u0130\u015fte bu dram da b\u00f6yle bitti\" (s.64)."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "[he sends Pentheus's mom into a frenzy during which she tears off Pentheus's head.

Buck\u2019s Korea to Euripides\u2019 Greece?This play would be authentic and current in any era, including today. Amazing. Stunning.Euripides lived from 480-406 BCE. In this play, the protagonist, Dionysus, is the son of a mortal mother, Semele, and a divine ruler of the world, Zeus. He appears on Earth in human form, he is killed and resurrected. Sound like any other figure in history you might have heard about?Dionysus, young and immortal, male and feminine, smiling and savage, born in Thebes but considered a barbarian, an animal, and a G-d. That is quite a lot to pack into one character. Oh, and I almost forgot, he is very into wine.His rival, and of course, his cousin, Pentheus, the king, is a somewhat conflicted man, unsettled in his sexuality, shall we say? It is incredible how Euripides deconstructs the outwardly mannish king in a comedic and not insulting way, so that you must laugh in the middle of a great tragedy. This head of state appears darling in his royal gown and wig, when he is only slightly prodded to cross dress. (there is no reference to a Queen).It is his last play, published posthumously, but it is an incomparable psychological masterpiece. Who knew? It is a study, in every aspect, of opposites. Dichotomies in each character. Wow.Unlike Medea, (I have not read Phaedra) an example of extreme feminine emotionality; in Bacchae, the protagonist is male, yet the plays\u2019 main concern is femininity, again; in thought, desire, and mind. This is what consumes Euripides thoughts and pen.And the chorus, always the chorus. Fascinating. Dithyrambs. Offstage in this production, carrying verses to the main platform by way of messenger. Imagine, this is twenty-five hundred years ago.In this period, the actors are all men, wearing masks to assume different roles. The audiences, in the thousands, are all men. I apologize, ladies, but I am only a reporter.It is almost inconceivable, to me, how this could be pulled off, and I would give a hundred bitcoins, to be in the audience and to witness this through modern eyes.It is short piece and I do not want to give any of it away.

Sophocles?Surely not the news."}, {"userName": "Po Po", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11138071-po-po", "userReview": "Totally insane story. For those who believe that videogames, TV shows and films are making us all a little more violent -- I present to you this classic play written somewhere between 485 and 406 BC. It contains unapologetic and gratuitous violence. Just for shits n giggles. This is open to interpretation, but I find that the point of this play is to reveal two messages: (1) \"Don't mess with higher powers\" or you'll die. And (2) humans are bloodthirsty (yes, this is a pessimistic and unpopular view). This terrifying play was written to satiate the audience's hunger for violence. Humanity hasn't become more violent or more crass or more debauched or more filthy through the centuries (or...millenia).

To be fair, death by lightening would lead most people to think you'd lied about shagging a God known for hurling bolts.What follows is an orgy (metaphorical and literal) of frenzied dancing, wine fountains, cross-dressing, ripping animals apart with your bare hands and women breast feeding wolves.Dionysus is hilariously sarcastic throughout the bloodshed, and this is so fantastically gruesome it becomes comedy rather than tragedy, until the very end. Then we're suddenly asked to feel sorry for and mourn the great deeds of the hapless villain, which weren't mentioned or even suggested up till that point. It's a sudden lurch, like I'd been watching some brilliantly over the top, comedy splatter fest and then we're abruptly transported to a morgue, where weeping families try to identify the victims from what's been left over by the steamroller.I am also a little bothered about poor Cadmus' fate. He believed Dionysus was a God and even tried to convert his unbelieving Grandson, so why does he get the shitty end of the stick along with the others?

Maybe I'm so impressed because it's the first time I've ever read Euripides. (Predictably enough, I'm dazzled by tragedy).The version I read is the translation of Bacchae by Richard Lattimore (I know goodreads says I read another edition, but I just really like this cover!) Translation of a work, especially when the language is so far away from contemporary English-- not just linguistically, but also in terms of a difference in epoch and culture of two millennium-- can make or break a work. The language Lattimore shapes into his English translation is a carnal poetry, beating like a drum to the same rhythm of the shuddering violence and shock of the original. You can still feel the passion of this play, as vivid as ever, 2,500 years later. That's quite a feat. Then again, it's sort of hard not to be entranced by a play where a mother \"maddened by the breath of god\" of a vengeful Dionysus, literally tears her son apart with her bare hands and mounts his head on her thyrsus because she thought it was a lion's. But bad translations can suffocate even the most alive of stories, so I'm very thankful to Lattimore. I bet Anne Carson probably does a good translation of this too, but I couldn't find a copy of her Bakkhai floating around. My two favorite sentences from this were:\"When you set chains on me, you manacle a god.\" (Dionysus in disguise, being very dramatic before he throws his eventual temper tantrum that includes the razing of a palace and incitement of a family to dismember their son).Also:\"Poor child,/ like a white swan warding it's weak father,/ why do you clasp those white arms around my neck?\" (This is said by Cadmus to his muderess daughter, once they know they're both exiled).Like I said, amazing."}, {"userName": "Lee Harmon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4788401-lee-harmon", "userReview": "For those who don\u2019t recognize the title, this ancient Greek theater piece is about the god Dionysus, god of wine. It was first performed in Athens, in 405 BC. And for those who still don\u2019t catch the connection to my blog, it\u2019s this: Many of the characteristics of Jesus are shared with this frivolous Greek god, and at least one of Jesus\u2019 miracles\u2014turning water into wine\u2014also seems closely related. In fact, the late Byzantine play, The Passion of Christ, drew heavily on the Bakkhai.Greek tragedies are a little hard for us to fully enter into two and a half millennia later, particularly as we struggle to understand on just at what level the Greeks believed in their gods, but the commentary of this book does a great job of making something foreign feel familiar. In the play, you\u2019ll see Dionysus\u2019 more unpleasant side \u2026 his usual ecstasy and abandon turn into vengeance and bloodlust, aimed toward a young king who seeks to discredit him. True to Greek form, the god wins, with no apparent attempt at a climaxing plot; we understand from the beginning that humans are doomed to subjection before the gods.

It was actually one of the best plays I've ever read.If you've ever watched True Blood and enjoyed the Maryann storyline, this play is basically the same premise. Dionysus comes to town, wreaks havoc on everything, and then dances merrily away down the road. He's easily the most fascinating character to come out of Greek literature because, I mean, what isn't cool about a guy who has a group of women out in the woods who are so entranced they take animals and/or people and eat them raw after tearing them apart limb-from-limb?I read the Arrowsmith translation of this play and thought it was very well done. I found myself seeing that, once something's translated, it tends to lose some of its dramatic qualities, but this isn't the case with the Bacchae. Everything is presented very well, with Agave's epiphany of what she's done at the end being one of my favorite scenes in a play ever.Overall, it was just great.
