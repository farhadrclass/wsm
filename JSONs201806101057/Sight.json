SHORTLISTED FOR THE WOMAN\u2019S PRIZE FOR FICTION 2018.It took two weeks for my hardcopy to arrive in the mail after I ordered it. I felt very drawn to this novel \u2014 very reflective- very literary- very much a woman\u2019s book. I did plenty of my own reflection as well. \u201cSight\u201d is about being a parent and a child...birth and death. The subject of mother\u2019s - women - children - birth - and death - sits with me deeper this time of year - [May & June] - than any other. My own birthday is at the end of May. My mother\u2019s was the first week in June. My older sister\u2019s - the end of June ( our tripod female birthday\u2019s growing up without a man in our house).....and my mother died in June. May is also Mother\u2019s Day. My two daughters call May \u2018mommy month\u2019. The way I remember the busy years of parenting our daughters - was May was so busy with their activities- theatre performances- swim meets- etc. - I quietly felt loss in the shuffle. I knew I had a birthday & Mother\u2019s Day in May... but some of those years were \u2018kids month\u2019 in my eyes. Yesterday the movie \u201cTully\u201d opened with Charlie Theron. It tore me up! A movie about motherhood. The performance by Theron had was so real - so raw - I was aching with tears. I admit to being extra sensitive these days too. But - every mother could relate to the exhaustion....if nothing else. May is suppose to be my \u2018happy\u2019 month. My daughters will be home visiting soon.Beautiful grown adults here to enjoy our relationships - no longer do I need to rush around from the theater to the swimming pool. It really is \u2018mommy month\u2019 now. But .....I\u2019m looking at life in ways these days I never did before - and it\u2019s somewhat frightening. STILL GRATEFUL....just a little scared....life has been throwing a lot of challenges all at once. I knew it would take effort to go to the movie yesterday. For a girl who loves to hike as much as reading - I\u2019m struggling with walking to my car from the front door of my house these days without pain. I woke up from my last \u2018nose repair\u2019 surgery two weeks ago with some nerve problem coming from my spin. I\u2019m in physical therapy almost daily with a scheduled MRI this week .... but as I was struggling walking slow to the movie \u2014 I notice every person in wheel chairs or people with walkers with \u2018fear\u2019....and sadness. I already have a bionic ankle which will need replacement again in about 7-10 more years. Walking is high on my list of important. Since I turned 65 last May... it\u2019s been one thing after another...( the shit kept hitting the fan with medical/ physical things)....skin cancer ( loss 1/2 of a nose: 4 surgeries).....osteoporosis diagnosis ....now struggling with walking? ....and for a little over 2 months now,I live with painful ulcer sores in the inside of my mouth. It\u2019s an autoimmune disease called Lichen Planus. I\u2019m still trying to get it to go away. No success yet - none of the medications have worked. So.....why share all this? Sometimes a book - a movie - or both - lands in our hands when we need it most. The question I\u2019m sitting with is... what am I to take from this book? From the movie yesterday. I tie them both together for some reason....It\u2019s MOTHER\u2019S ....FEMALE MONTH...This book is a powerful reminder. HAPPY MOTHER\u2019S DAY to all my female friends here.....( even if not a mother).... as all women are mothers. A couple more thoughts ....then I\u2019ll focus directly on the novel \u201cSIGHT\u201d.1...I wondered how I would have felt about this book if I read it when my mother was alive - and before giving birth. I think it would have been incredibly beneficial.2...I\u2019d love my daughters to read this book....( not yet)....but when they are in another cycle of their lives. ( they don\u2019t have children - nor do they plan to)....but I believe every woman goes through the \u2018mothering stage\u2019 at one time - or another - in some form in their lives. Now about *Sight*......It\u2019s not a book for everyone. But I do think almost any reader who appreciates literary fiction at all - would \u2018at least\u2019 be incredibly impressed and moved by Jessie Greengrass\u2019s stunning writing. Hard to believe this is a debut. The narrator\u2019s recollections are of her mother \u2014 her mother\u2019s death \u2014and of her grandmother who was a psychoanalyst. Intertwined the narrator shares major medical discoveries: the X-Ray by Wilhelm Rontgen...Sigmund Freud\u2019s work...and science about the anatomy of pregnant bodies. I found the science history of the book -- interesting - but less absorbing than when the narrator was more personal grappling with grief and or worry....more directly connected with her own life. She and Johannes definitely wanted to have a baby ..... but she was sincerely worried....would she be a good mother? Fear hit her hard while caring for her terminally ill mother. The recollection shorty after her mother died not only moved me -but I reflected on a similar experience with my own mother. My mom died alone. She was found dead on her kitchen floor. I have replayed her moments before her death a million times. But ....a specific memory came to me when we were almost happy together. .....AND SO WAS OUR NARRATOR WITH HER MOTHER:\u201cAt last, even with me always present, the work of caring for my mother at home became too much. One morning, struggling from her bed to the bathroom, pushing a walking frame in front of her, she stumbled and fell, sitting down heavily on the carpet. She was unhurt but no longer had the strength to stand back up and although for a while I tried to right her, tugging her this way and that, bringing various items of furniture to use as props or levers, I was unable to lift her weight. I had to call an ambulance because she wasn\u2019t a priority we sat for hours, side-by-side on the bedroom floor, waiting for it to arrive. I made us lunch, sandwiches to eat on our knees, the sort I have picnic she had made me sometimes as a child on rainy Saturdays, and the fragile cast of this memory brought a kind of complicity between us, a resurgence of the intimacy that we had once possessed, so that for a while it was almost as though we were happy\u201d. As for thoughts of becoming a mother....\u201cSometimes, when I saw a woman in a caf\u00e9 pick up a baby from a pram, I felt a weight in my own arms, a heaviness, where nothing was, and the force of my longing for a child was such that I had to turn away but still I could only feel how impossible it was that I should ever manage such complicated love\u201d. And just before giving birth....\u201c I find that when I think of my mother now it is not have that version of herself which she became when ill, nor of how was when, throughout my childhood, compromise forced her into unspectacular unhappiness, but rather it is at this woman whom I never knew, whose face bends down to meet her child\u2019s, whose hands I close, who smiles. I feel such tenderness towards her. She must have known so little, then, of what it is to have a child, but had to learn it all from scratch, and did \u2014 as I have done, and all the rest of us, learning from the moment we are born how to be one single version of ourselves with all the losses that entails. I am so used to thinking of my mother is someone who is complete, her life concluded, that to imagine her at this moment, caught during those few weeks when everything was, briefly and for both of us, possibility, is to feel her startlingly close, her death unwound. She is not shut and done with but persists, and I am glad\u201d. Really beautiful ....tender...emotional & heartfelt ....poignant....."}, {"userName": "Gumble's Yard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard", "userReview": "I had no understanding of the drive to exhume that now turns my quiet moments into imperfect acts of reminiscence: how it is to feel that one must note each detail of one\u2019s thoughts in case that thing should pass unseen which might otherwise provide the key, laying out the shadows of the bones which rib and arch and hold the whole togetherIt strikes me as extraordinary, now, that we should be so hidden from ourselves, our bodies and our minds so inaccessible, in such large part uncharted: but there is a thrill to it, too: that same mixture of terror and quickening which confronts us where underneath the sea the light gives out and unnamed creatures float\nI read this book as part of its longlisting for the 2018 Women\u2019s Prize, although I had been aware of the book from some early reviews and had expected it to make the longlist. I am not surprised to see it shortlisted.\u201cSight\u201d is the author\u2019s debut novel, after a critically acclaimed book of short stories. I can see and can understand that this book may not be to the taste of many readers \u2013 but I feel that what others do not like about the book is what I most enjoyed.A FT review by Sam Leith described it (rather condescendingly in my view) as a certain sort of literary novel in which not much happens and with musings \u2026 expressed in a mannered register with very little resemblance to the way the average 21st-century person talks. In contrast I do not expect literary fiction to be plot heavy, my fellow Goodreads reviewer Paul has often remarked of the \u201cspoiler\u201d tag on Goodreads; that by definition a book which has a plot which can be spoiled is already flawed. Further I do not read literature to reproduce \u201csay, like how the average girl, kind of talks?\u201dFrom unfavourable or neutral Goodreads reviewers, the book has drawn comparison both to Rachel Cusk and to W.G. Sebald: whereas I regarded these comparisons as something that attracted me to the book and in both cases can see the links: perhaps a double aspect to the link in both cases, of Cusk her book on motherhood and her annihilated perspective style, of Sebald his weaving of historical fact into fiction and in a reference to East Anglian beaches), albeit the novel has style of its own. The book\u2019s premise is simple \u2013 our unnamed narrator, married to Johannes and with a young daughter is pregnant with their second child. She reflects on her relationships with her mother, grandmother and daughters (born and unborn), and on her past and future roles herself as daughter, granddaughter and mother and on the transition between these relationships as well as that from child to adolescence to adulthood.The narrator is a voracious reader, and after the death of her mother, before marrying, she spends time in the Wellcome library (as did the author herself writing the book), searching through the medicine books there in the hope she might find the fact which would make sense of my grown unhappiness, allowing me to peel back the obscurant layers of myself and lay bare at last the solid structure underneath, her quest described as I sought among so many books a way to understand myself by analogy, a pattern recognised in other lives which might be drawn across my own to give it shape and, given shape, to give it impetus, directionAs an aside \u2013 the Wellcome Trust sponsors one of the most intriguing book prizes in the UK and this book must surely be a contender for the 2019 Prize.This search seems to give her book a shape and pattern \u2013 the book being effectively rearranged in three parts \u2013 each concentrating on a particular relationship (respectively her mother, her psychoanalyst grandmother and her unborn daughter) and on a scientific figure (Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen \u2013 who discovered x-rays, Sigmund Freud and his children, John Hunter \u2013 a pioneering surgeon and collector, who helped introduce science back to the practice of medicine, his brother William and the anatomical sketches they commissioned from Jan van Rymsdyk, including of the dissection of a heavily pregnant woman with a full-term fetus). Initially these sections can seem disjointed both within themselves (between the narrators reflections on her life and the scientific parts) and between the different sections \u2013 but gradually the reader uncovers the overlaps between these parts \u2013 the recurring themes of stripping apart, examination, of transitions, of boundaries, of the difference and interaction between the superficial and deep.At this point and to give a flavour for the book (and simply because I noted down so much of the book \u2013 the book being littered with post-it notes when I finished), a number of examples are useful:On something which the narrator obsesses about \u2013 that R\u00f6ntgen handed in his first paper on X-rays on the same day the Lumi\u00e8re brothers first publically showed their collection of cinematography: Rontgen \u2026 had seen all that had been solid go towards transparency. Opaque materials, wood, stone, his own flesh \u2013 had been reduced for him to shadowed outline, leaving the image of a substrate world spread out across a photographic plate, a catalogue of metal and bone and all that would not rot to set against cinema\u2019s preservation of surface \u2013 \u201cThe initial excitement of the public at x-rays (and a link forward to Freud\u2019s work) [hope that] knowing the constitution of their bodies they might be granted understanding of their mindsFreud and the Vienna Psychoanalytic society \u2013 this earnest group of men saw themselves \u2026 as architects of a future in which clarity was assured and all the convoluted crenellations of the mind would be unfoldedHer grandmother taking about analysis told her Without reflection, without the capacity to trace our lives backwards and pick the patterns out, we become liable to act as animals do, minus foresight and according to a set of governing laws, which we have never taken the trouble to explore. Without reflection, we do little more than drift upon the surface of things and self-determination is an illusion. And later When a person has gained the skills necessary to explore the territory for themselves, to unpack their own minds and begin to understand the contents, they might start the work necessary to make their experience, their behaviour meaningful: and then at last they might start to become transparent to themselvesComparing her pregnant self to Susini\u2019s Anatomical Venus (a clear link to the sketches of van Rymsdyk) I imagine how I would look laid out like this, formed into layers, each one a shell, demountable, and at the centre of it the indivisible nut my child makes, and how then all of it might be removed, stacked carefully up beside my open, undecaying carcassOn her daughter growing up: Now she stands apart and I must reach for her, on each occasion a little further until it seems her progress towards adulthood is a kind of disappearance and that I know her less and less the more she becomes herselfHer mother\u2019s illness (shortly after twenty one) \u2013 her need for me forcing into reverse that inevitable process of separation which was the work of adolescenceSorting through her mother\u2019s possessions: To pick through dusty boxes, to sift through memories which fray and tear like ageing paper in an effort to find out who we are, is to avoid the responsibility of choice, since when it comes to it we only have ourselves, now, and the ever narrowing cone of what we might enactWhen tending to her child I see the outline of my mother\u2019s hands beneath the skin of mine . and I hear her voice in mine performing the liturgy of endearments, those sibilant invitations to returning sleep \u2013 and I wonder if these things are soothing in themselves or if it is rather that through generational repetition they have become that way, a memory taught and retaught, the epigenetics of comfort: \u2026. I feel memory as enactment and my mother, my grandmother, in nay hands and my arms, a half-presence, no longer lostWhat I found particularly clever about this book was the way that its own subject matter becomes a meta-commentary on how the book itself is constructed, for example: the importance of the boundaries between the scientific historical sections and those sections with the narrators own musings; the way that layers are peeled back, examined and later reassembled \u2013 with the superficial in literary and anatomical terms contrasted with the deep; the importance of the \u201cbare bones\u201d of the novel\u2019s structure overlaid with the interwoven complexity of the themes that run like blood vessels and nerves through it. Even the author\u2019s idiosyncrasies of punctuation, with paragraphs and sentences ending with \u201c \u2013 \u201c (see the R\u00f6ntgen example above) emphasises the idea of boundary and transition.I found the descriptions of the process of bereavement moving. For example, on realising she cannot bleed her mother\u2019s radiators, reset her boiler, or replace the salt in her dishwater: This is where grief is found, in these suddenly unfilled cracks, these responsibilities \u2013 minute, habitual \u2013 which have lain elsewhere for years and which, having failed amongst grief\u2019s greater broil to be reapportioned, are overlooked in favour of the more dramatic, until even the ordinary starts to crumbleI also loved and particularly identified (albeit very imperfectly as the father some of the descriptions of pregnancy in the third part)On welcoming a second child, while making the first still feel full loved A reminder to our daughter that completion is elastic and she was enough even as we planned her augmentationDifferences in her and Johannes view of pregnancy: What I felt as a set of prohibitions and a physical incapacity, a slow-fast remaking of my own biology, was for him hardly more than anticipation, like waiting for Christmas to comeThen how she describes her feelings and experiences watching a foetal heart trace, her meetings with consultants (her pregnancy from the day the baby was found breech a series of waits on uncomfortable chairs clutching plastic cups from the water fountain in the corner of the waiting room), undergoing an ECV, the early stages of induction two days spent walking round and round the hospital car park in the hope labour might begin and their contrast with its violent ending, and birth as a ten hour lesson in topography.I also found the (inadvertent) links with other Women\u2019s Prize books fascinating: Freud considering his youngest daughter and eventual collaborator and continuer of his work his Anna Antigone (linking to Home Fire); On Johannes before the birth He would not feel the child\u2019s weight until he held it in his arms \u2013 linking to the most harrowing aspects of The Trick to Time)Overall I found this an outstanding book."}, {"userName": "Kamil", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23253765-kamil", "userReview": "I believe this might be the first book that made me start comprehending what it means to be a parent.

Luckily, it's something I've never strongly desired so I'm satisfied in the role of uncle, godfather and sometimes babysitter to friends' children. However, some reasons I'd be frightened of having children (beyond a total ignorance of how to care for them) is a dread of making some irreparable mistake and also the inability of protecting them from experiencing pain at some point. Jessie Greengrass describes this as \u201cthe overwhelming fear of fucking up that having children brings, the awareness of the impossibility of not causing hurt like falling into endless water\u201d. Her debut novel \u201cSight\u201d is a reflection on the process of having children and why her narrator is particularly self conscious about the continuation of her lineage. But, more than that, it's a remarkably poignant meditation on the internal and external levels of our mental and physical reality. The narrator is a young woman who cared for her mother during her terminal illness and now faces the prospect of becoming a mother herself. She sifts through her personal past and considers the lives of disparate individuals such as Sigmund & (his daughter) Anna Freud, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen (the first man who produced and published scientific studies of X-rays) and scientist/surgeon John Hunter. In doing so, she embarks on a journey into how she might allow her child to see the multiple layers of life and thus pass on an abiding sense of happiness.Read my full review of Sight by Jessie Greengrass on LonesomeReader"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32647049-jennifer", "userReview": "Hmmm.

Greengrass plays with the concepts of sight and insight, and how the desire to see the world and to understand it are intertwined. Her protagonist is a woman who is expecting her second child, and a lot of the story is her contemplating and trying to understand her roles as a mother, a partner, a daughter and a granddaughter. Which brings us to the the first issue I had with the book: Her thoughts and observations are pretty unoriginal and also overblown in a sense that many cases of stating-the-obvious are presented as cutting-edge ideas, which makes for an annoying reading experience. What is new and original about the text though is how Greengrass creates a montage in which she juxtaposes her protagonist's musings with other people's quest to gain new perspectives and insights while balancing family relations, namely: - The Brothers Lumi\u00e8re: Auguste and Louis revolutionized the concept of seeing by inventing the cinematograph, which means that they were the first filmmakers in history;- Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen and his wife Bertha: R\u00f6ntgen of course invented the X-ray, he literally looked inside people;- Sigmund Freud and his daughter Anna: The inventor of psychoanalysis wanted to look inside his patient's minds;- John Hunter and his brother William: They were pioneers as surgeons and anatomists, so...you get the idea.Unfortunately, the montage technique is very clumsy, with Greengrass simply interspersing the text with huge paragraphs about the inventors and scientists named above - it's not exactly meeting the Clemens Meyer-elegance-standard for postmodern extravanganza, if you know what I mean. Plus the author is guilty of another literary crime: She is explaining her concept to us - in the text. We're not stupid, Greengrass, we get it, especially as you are really, really hammering it home.

I read this by virtue of its long listing for the Baileys Womens Prize for Literature, 2018.It has a really good chance of winning (deservedly in my opinion).The pregnant narrator is a deep thinker, and a serious, reflective person. She is searching out her own life\u2019s meaning, and her anticipation of her unborn child\u2019s coming existence is primarilycontemplative of the new child\u2019s needs.\u201cThis is what we all do, this striving to make sense\u201d(103).This, though, is not a book that becomes too narrowly focused or introspective. This is a consequence of Jessie Greengrass\u2019s excellent insertion of three historical figures whose own search for truth and enlightenment mirrors that of our pregnant narrator.The book starts with Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen and the invention of the X Ray.Best known of the three figures is Sigmund Freud\u201cThis analysis is harder than any other\u201d(102)Then there\u2019s the trio of, anatomists William Hunter and John Hunter, and the artist Jan Van Rymsdyk.Each of these true stories is fascinating in its own right, and the \u201cstriving to make sense\u201d illuminates our highly, understandably, sensitive mother-to-be.This is an excellent book and highly recommended.I had the chance to attend Jessie Greengrass in conversation with John Mitchinson at a small gathering at Waterstones in London. An evening which provided some great background on the book. Understanding Greengrass\u2019s own influences and ambition, and the chance to google the clues she gave added to my already high regard for Sight.Authors who influenced the writing SightW. G. Sebald In particular The Rings of Saturn. Sebald\u2019s first-person narrative is the account by a nameless narrator on a walking tour of Suffolk. In addition to describing the places he sees and people he encounters, various episodes of history and literature are referenced. Unlike Sebald, though, Greengrass said that she is NOT the narrator!! John Donne Sermons Donne was writing when Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in1626. Greengrass aspires to the \u2018old style\u2019 essay writingKnausgaard & David Foster Wallace Greengrass admires both writers, and for Foster Wallace particularly she praises the beauty and honesty of his short story/essay writing about himself. Greengrass stressed that hers is not a non- fiction book, and that she\u2019s not good enough to write such a book. Melanie Kline Sight was originally going to be about Melanie Kline, the Austrian-British psychoanalyst who devised novel therapeutic techniques for children that influenced child psychology and contemporary psychoanalysis. However the book wouldn\u2019t develop properly, and the eventual storyline about pregnancy was the last thing to emerge.Two of the first children Kline analysed were her son and daughter. One child died, the other wouldn\u2019t speak to her mother in adulthood.The arrival of Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalyst daughter, Anna Freud, in London in 1938, came into conflict with Klein\u2019s work.While the Freudian and analytical aspects of mother child relationship are central to Sight, Greengrass couldn\u2019t make Kline story work sufficiently to become the book\u2019s pivot. Structure of the book Three trimesters; three historical perspectives. Very neat? Jessie Greengrass thought so, and then went on to say she first had this drawn to attention at a reading, but that it was accidental. She said how interesting it was, though, to have clever and intelligent interpretations of the book coming out which strengthened the writers original messages. Academic philosophyJessie Greengrass studied Philosophy at university (rather than English, the expected training ground for writers). Philosophy is avowedly a major influence on her writing style, and particularly the precision that the discipline brings. Greengrass needed to find a very precise form of words (Mitchener, in conversation was examining the absence of plot and the importance of mood and setting).Philosophy also demands rigorous enquiry, and in her acknowledgements Greengrass talks about her hours in London\u2019s Wellcome library. c.18th Philosophy connected the writer and subject, a strong and key theme, both for mother and baby, and also for the three historical examples cited, and reflected upon, by Greengrass. Hence Freud\u2019s \u201cThis analysis is harder than any other\u201d(102). The title was the subject of numerous emails between publisher and author! \u201cOn Sight\u201d;\u201dImaging\u201d; \u201cIn Despair\u201d were all considered and rejected. Greengrass gave the impression that the eventual title chosen wasn\u2019t nt especially meaningful!Greengrass also said she\u2019s not very good at naming her characters.Anticipating the future, Greengrass, who is due to give birth soon, does not expect to write a book in the same style.She doesn\u2019t write dialogue, and she\u2019s not interested in plot (thus ironically given her love of Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie). She is interested in people\u2019s inner thought processes rather than description from the outside.I, for one, look forward to her future work, having given my first five star review of the year to Sight."}, {"userName": "Jaclyn Crupi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13323030-jaclyn-crupi", "userReview": "A trusted reader has called it that SIGHT will win this year\u2019s Booker Prize and I think he could be right.

Why suffer from 'morning sickness' when one can experience 'the constant queasy ostinato over which rose exhaustion\u2019s disharmonious cadence, a progression paused before the point of resolution, aching forwards.'As MisterHobgoblin said in his review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) \"the language is convoluted and when the reader unpicks the complexity to expose the meaning, there isn\u2019t always very much to find.\"The beautiful sentences worked well when discussing the historic figures (although even here the part about Sigmund and Anna Freud felt much weaker than the two surrounding stories, perhaps because it is more well trodden territory). For example, this description of when R\u00f6ntgen took an x-ray picture of his wife's hand, which has been recorded in posterity as the first x-ray.'R\u00f6ntgen, who for weeks had been alone in his newly understood world, had sought with this image Bertha\u2019s admittance to it, the making of the picture a gesture of both initiation and affection: the tenderness of her bones made visible to them both, confirmation of the life which had formed such extraordinary structures; but these things are a matter of interpretation. To Bertha, whose hands were solid, whose body unitary, who had not doubted those things that constituted her \u2013her skin, her thoughts; the single object that was flesh housing mind \u2013nor sought to understand them, it had the chilly, soily smell of tombs. \u2014It is, she said \u2014like seeing my own death \u2014and she turned away, and refused to look again.'But for the more personal parts of the novel, it diminished the power rendering the experience dull: I felt the emotions had been fitted to the sentence, rather than the opposite. The comparison to the rawer more visceral prose of authors like Patty Yumi Cottrell, Gwendoline Riley or Ariana Harwicz is not to Sight's credit. Indeed, for a short (200 page) novel, it took me longer than normal to read, as I had to put it down frequently to avoid falling asleep.For a more generous take sees the reviews from Gumble's Yard (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) and Jonathan (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)But for me, disappointing. 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 due to the high expectations I had.---------------Some quotes and thoughts:'He liked to repeat experiments others had already performed, not so much to check the veracity of their results as because this careful reconstruction, the slow rhythm of test and repeat, brought with it that particular quality of understanding which is got only by having seen for oneself: a grasp which is something like illumination, the reframing of proposition to fact so that the truth of it is felt, immediate.....R\u00f6ntgen appears to have been baffled by [a] journalist\u2019s interest, his persistent attempts to force R\u00f6ntgen towards an account, not of the work that he had done, its procedures and its progress, but of the way it had felt to do it. What, the journalist asked, did you think when you saw the faint glow across the laboratory? To which R\u00f6ntgen answered, \u2018I didn\u2019t think; I investigated\u2014\u2019'Two excellent sentences explaining R\u00f6ntgen's approach to science, and which fits well with the approach of surgeon and anatomist John Hunter in the third part of the novel: 'In adulthood this dislike of academic study became a principle of sorts \u2013he distrusted that which might be learned from books, believing that it was always better to see for oneself with truth not proved until it had been performed.'Staring at the ceiling, the exposed skin of my abdomen filling the silence like an unacknowledged solecism, I wondered if this leaching of character or compassion on her part was intentional \u2013 if it were done in case, needing either later, she might find that she had squandered them on the ordinary amongst us, we whose unborn children leaped and flipped about , indistinguishable from each other; or if it were itself an act of compassion, pre-emptive and organised: a way of sparing those for whom this day would be a shattering, insulating them from her sudden change of tone, a tightening of the skin about her mouth or eyes, the lurch from friendliness to intercession.The sonographer in the pre-natal ultrasound department - here the sentence stays just the right side of the line, but as the narrator turns her attention on herself ...'It would be dreadful\u2014 meaning all the time that I knew what our decision would be but that I didn\u2019t know what degree of guilt or distress I might feel, all outcomes seeming to me so far entirely hypothetical, and I was worried I would feel nothing for this entity which was as yet more idea than child, which was in its own presumptive wellness experienced as the expectation of an unimaginably different future and as a combination of sickness and obligation, a requirement to regard my choices as circumscribed.'The anxiety of the first-time mother awaiting her fetal development ultrasound scan: lovely writing but the power is completely lost in the unnecessary words.'Revelation pended, the veil between myself and understanding was in a constant state of almost-rending, and I thought I could see shadows through it, the outlines of an as-yet uncomprehended truth, until all at once the mania crested and what came out of it, in place of elucidation, was agony, my head pinned in a vice, my body hanging limp below it, a disarticulated sack of bones and blood around which my limbs curled, stiff and liable to snap.'No. me neither.'Each evening when the library shut I walked home, an hour\u2019s steady, thoughtless progress through the evening streets with their clots of drinkers outside pubs, their newspaper sellers and fruit stalls, skirting north through the decaying Georgian streets above King\u2019s Cross towards the gentility of Islington\u2019s garden squares and then down onto the towpath to walk along the canal into Hackney.'Words that could have been lifted from Brookner's Look At Me, a comparison that doesn't flatter Sight.'Sometimes, when in the woods I watch my daughter with indefatigable hopefulness attempt to climb a tree whose first branch is five times her own height above the earth, tiny fingers thrust into crevasses or knots, red wellingtons scrabbling on curved bark for purchase, I feel myself winded by the desire to promise a protection that I cannot give; and if, then, I thought there was a way that I could make her life better than the ordinary \u2013if I thought that I could make it smoother, softer, less fraught with the sudden, troubled revelation that hidden motivation brings, or with the half-rotted-through desire for what will come to haunt or hurt her \u2013if I could give her clarity, self-knowledge, sight \u2013and if, telling her the secret now to stop her searching for it later, I could leave happiness to her like a legacy \u2013then I would; and if afterwards it turned out that she wasn\u2019t happy after all then how would it be possible to say it was my fault?'Perhaps the source of the novel's title."}, {"userName": "Britta B\u00f6hler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38530619-britta-b-hler", "userReview": "Not my kind of book.

She doesn't reflect on them in chronological order, but jumps around. We read about her first pregnancy, the death of her mother, her childhood holidays at her grandmother's house (her grandmother is a psychoanalyst), her relationship with her husband, her second pregnancy. She reflects on what it means to be a daughter and to have a daughter, on what it means to move from childhood to adulthood.But mixed in with these thoughts, we also read about three areas of scientific advancement. Wilhelm Rontgen's work on x-rays, Freud's work on psychoanalysis and Jan van Rymsdyk's work (alongside others) documenting discoveries about human anatomy, especially of pregnant women.To begin with, it feels rather random. But gradually themes emerge. In Part 1, we focus on Rontgen and read about the crowds rushing to have their x-rays taken at fairgrounds\"...and surely this is what bought them, all that summer, running to the fairground booths: the promise of the simplifying power of explanation, sight: that knowing the constitution of their bodies they might be granted understanding of their minds.\"And this links to Part 2 which uses our narrator\u2019s grandmother\u2019s profession as a link to Freud. And we read\"...; after all, what are we if not a totality of days, a sum of interactions; and a glimpse of what is underneath the surface, the skeleton on which the outer face is hung, cannot undo the knowledge of skin but only give it context, the way it rises and falls, its puckering, its flaws.\"which reflects back to Rontgen and the x-rays revealing what is hidden.In Part 1, we start to believe that physically, when the x-rays remove the surface layer, we are all the same: one skeleton looks like another. But Part 2 then shows us that what is invisible is what really makes us unique. We have an interlude that focuses on models of physical bodies followed by Part 3 which echoes Olga Tokarczuk's Flights by juxtaposing the travels of Huygen's probe with maps of human veins and anatomy.All around us as we read, there are images that force us to think about what we can know about our bodies, our minds, our relationships. And mixed in with this, our narrator thinks about her own body, her own mind, her own relationships. There is some wonderful writing about grief\"I had thought that loss would be dramatic, that it would be a kind of exercise, when instead it was the emptiness of everything going on as before and nothing working as it ought.\"And our narrator reflects on what it is to be a daughter, to be a parent, to be a spouse. What does it mean to move from childhood to adulthood? What does it mean to watch your own children take that journey?The only down side of this book is the sometimes over-cooked prose. And I recognise that that is a matter of personal taste. I am a great fan of poetic writing (e.g. Denis Johnson), but of the kind where a carefully chosen word explodes in your mind to become paragraphs or pages. I am less keen on the kind where paragraphs or pages have to implode to form a single sentence that means something and there were times when I wished Greengrass would just come out with it and not take several paragraphs to say what could be said in a word.It's taken me a long time to write a review of this book. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve written it several times and deleted it. It\u2019s a book that becomes more impressive when you stop to think about it, which is why I\u2019ve started again so many times before settling on this inadequate summary. My honest reaction whilst reading it was to wish that it would move a bit more quickly, although, strangely for someone who hardly ever reads non-fiction, I liked the historical bits far more than the rest of it when I was reading. But every time I wrote down what I thought, my thoughts changed and the book became more impressive and more cohesive. I found myself more and more willing to forgive the writing that wasn\u2019t quite to my personal taste and to acknowledge the strength of what is there.So, having set out thinking I would write a review that said \"2.5 stars rounded up to 3\", I find myself setting on 4 stars.Which is a surprise."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anne", "userReview": "I'm sure every new parent underestimates the overwhelming life-changing effects and the personal growth needed to cope, which is probably just as well when you eventually realise that your beloved offspring may be your hostage to fortune.Childbirth, death, unconditional love and parental fears are the themes here, interwoven with stories of the insights brought about by scientific and medical research.

Quite often her internal monologue borderlines with self-analysis (as it would be defined by clinical physiology). It is probably not a coincidence that her grandmother in the novel is a shrink, and she brings up Freud as part of the narrative. Predominantly, she reflects on her relationship with her grandmother and her mother, now both dead, and her own impending motherhood. Her thoughts are intermingled with the insets about certain historical figures who thrived to see inside the human being either physically or emotionally. She talks about Rotgen, Freud and his relationship with his daughter, and John Hunter, the surgeon in the 18th century. Her sentences are long and complex, fronted with length adverbials. But i like how smoothly she moves from one idea to another, how she mixes different periods of her life. I did not read a lot of books by English authors in such a style. Rachel Cusk is only one who comes to mind with her trilogy of \u201cOutline\u201d, \u201cTransit\u201d and what comes next. But Cusk writing is more directed outside, she writes down the encounters with others, she observes. This one is totally introvert of a novel. It is more like auto-fiction of Knaussguard, but less transgressional and more compact.The protagonist\u2019s reflections possess very philosophic undertones. It might be not surprising as the authour has got a degree in philosophy. For some people it might come across as pretentious, but I enjoyed it. For example, she considers the process of growing up \u201cas solitary process of disentanglement from those who made us and the reality of it cannot be avoided but only, perhaps, deferred\u2026\u201d . She even thinks about it while hugging her little daughter: \u201cI respond with agonising gratitude that I must hide from her in case feeling the heft of it, she might become encumbered and not do what she was born for which is to go away from me. It is a balance to show enough love that she is sure of me but not so much that she stays close: the fact but not the size of it - and it is an effort, as I encourage her to disentangle herself from my gaze..\u201d Whilst \u201cdisentanglement\u201d is certainly a fact, I was a bit saddened by her stance to limit her closeness to her child for the sake of philosophy, what it seems\u2026Following the necessity of \u201cdisentanglement\u201d she has got quite interesting view of knowing the family history: \u201cTo pick through dusty boxes. to sift through memories which fray and tear like ageing paper in an effort to find out who we are , is to avoid the responsibility of choice, since when it comes to it we have only ourselves , now and the ever-narrowing cone of what we might enact.\u201d Respectively she discards everything which is left of her mum into the skip. This seems to me very radical view, totally different from the book which I\u2019ve finished before this one \u201cAlone in the classroom\u201d by Elizabeth Hay, where a bit older protagonist is actively searching knowledge of her past which ended up affecting her present\u2026While I enjoyed the main monologue, I found the historical insets less successful. They are really well researched - the author even provides the bibliography at the end of the book. They contain very interesting observations such as the low value of life in the18th century or the impact of phychoanalysis on small children. But overall I found these insets too lengthy to integrate into the narrative. The overwhelmingly strongest theme for me was how she describes the state of pregnancy, the emotional and philosophic transformations which take place during this period in a woman, the insecurities involved in the process of deciding to have a child. Sadly, this phenomena do not have sufficient representation in the literature. Normally the maximum what is mentioned is physical symptoms and them the child pops up and a novel moves on from there. But those 9 moths and the following birth are the one of the most powerful emotional experience any woman (and the affected partner) are going through. I know only one another book which is dealing with this - \u201cThe Argonauts\u201d by Meggie Nelson. There, the impact is substantially stronger than in this book. You feel immediacy of the experience, its transformative power. Here, it is more reflective and detached, but still good.This novel would not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but enjoyed it and found a lot to think about. The writer to watch.Quotes:\u201cOur understanding of the past we did not inhabit will always be a fiction.\u201d\u201cI had thought that loss would be dramatic, that it would be kind of exercise, when instead it was the emptiness of everything going on as before and nothing working as it ought.\u201d\u201cWithout reflection we do little more than drift upon the surface of things and self-determination is illusion.

To say that I have conflicting feelings about this novel would be an understatement; it's like every singular element of this novel draws two completely contradictory reactions from me. I both admire it and find it insufferable at the exact same time.Let's start with the prose, which is what everyone is going to be talking about when they talk about Sight, and rightfully so. It feels like Jessie Greengrass's sentences go on for days, each one carefully crafted to show very evident technical skill. Some of these sentences are striking, with poignant, meaningful commentary on the human condition:\n\n\"I want only what I think we all must want: to come off as better than I ought, more generous, more sure--kinder than I know myself to be; but I want also to be known, to be counted and to be excused. I can't have both.\"\n\nSome, not so much:\n\n\"All morning, caught up in the business of appointments, I had forgotten to feel sick, but now it returned, the constant queasy ostinato over which rose exhaustion's disharmonious cadence, a progression paused before the point of resolution, aching forwards.\"\n\nI mean, 'I had morning sickness' would have sufficed, but okay.After a while of immersing yourself in this prose, what first feels lush and fresh begins to feel methodical and calculated - even the variances of syntax have a very distinct rhythm to them. At times I would get lulled into it, and at others, it would feel like it was written by a particularly verbose robot. The interesting thing about Sight is that while it endeavors to reflect on the human condition, it does so in such a measured way it's almost as if it's devoid of all humanity. This is a book and a character that wants to be able to reduce the human experience to a series of elements which can be scientifically categorized, made evident by the heavy integration of medical history into the narrative.That brings me to my next point, which is that Sight is very light on the narrative. This entire book is driven by the narrator's fixation on her relationship with her mother, on whether or not she wants to have a child, on her ownership of her own body - and while I'd take character-driven novels over plot-driven novels any day, I hesitate to even call this character-driven, because by the end of it, we still know hardly anything about this person. For all the navel-gazing in this novel, we don't even know where this character works. Does she even have a job? No, this isn't the point, but it also makes it harder to fully immerse yourself in this character's world.There's another line, \n\"but the price of sight is wonder's diminishment\"\n which I think not only sums up this character's introspective journey, but also, for me sort of characterizes the book as a whole. This is a book which dives into themes which I ordinarily find interesting - how well can we truly know other people, how well can we know ourselves - and examines them so thoroughly, it leaves almost no room for the reader to actively engage. I feel like this is one of those novels which attempts to ask questions of its readers without being particularly interested in their answers, because you can find all of the answers in its pages. I mean, maybe that's not even a bad thing. It just doesn't get me particularly excited.I admire the technical skill that went into this novel, but it ultimately didn't leave as strong of an impression on me as I had hoped it would.

We follow an unnamed narrator grappling with feelings of inadequacy on her journey to becoming a parent, caring for her dying mother and recounting early memories of her psychoanalyst grandmother. These narrative pieces are interlaced with historical accounts of scientific developments, such as the discovery of x-rays, the founding of psychoanalysis and 18th century investigations into human anatomy. The author weds these seemingly disconnected pieces into an examination of big themes \u2013 growing up as a gradual umbilical disentanglement from our past, the moment of (scientific) discovery when sight tips into insight, and ultimately the quest for self-knowledge as a process of peeling back of the obscuring layers (in the same way that x-rays, psychoanalysis and anatomical dissection make the hidden manifest). Thus, scientific discovery becomes the lens through which to examine the personal, and vice versa.Greengrass\u2019 writing style is particularly striking and combines the cerebral lyricism of Sarah Moss with the incisive memoir-ish intimacy of Maggie Nelson. Occasionally, the author\u2019s lyrical virtuosity works against itself, thwarting the pace of the story.Despite its fascinating themes and beguiling prose, the novel does have some issues. Ultimately, it feels more like an essay collection than a coherent work of fiction. The characters themselves are mere shadows, props against which to bounce the neurotic musings of the narrator, and there is no plot or development to speak of. The book takes itself very seriously \u2013 each narrated moment subject to micro-analysis and imbued with existential gravity \u2013 and as a result, there is no ease and lightness to contrast the severity.

She also explores different scientific events that weave into the story with poignancy and skill.

If it doesn\u2019t come naturally, leave it.\u201d So said Al Stewart in 1976. Forty-two years later, this is a message that still resonates. Sight is a text that is undoubtedly clever. Our narrator, a young pregnant and oh-so-artistically nameless woman considers the female generations of her family. In the first of three parts, she considers her mother who has passed away some time ago. This is interwoven with the story of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, the discoverer of x-rays. Then we consider the grandmother, a psychoanalyst known universally as Doctor K. This is juxtaposed with the story of Sigmund Freud and his family. Finally, we consider our narrator\u2019s unborn daughter, told alongside the story of John Hunter, a pioneer of modern surgery. The compartmentalising of the story into three sections, each with its medical counterpoint, feels heavily contrived. The counterpoint stories add little; they are not told in enough depth to be interesting, they just seem to add padding. But in truth, the main story itself is not much of a story. Mostly it is philosophising on the nature of love and life. By the time we get to the ultra-sounds in Part 3 we feel we have already been navel-gazing for quite a while. The language is convoluted and when the reader unpicks the complexity to expose the meaning, there isn\u2019t always very much to find. Sight is an interesting compare/contrast with David Park\u2019s Travelling in a Strange Land, also a meditation on life, familial generations and grief; also essentially an interior monologue; but done without the padding, contrived parallel stories, or cod-philosophy. Basically, David Park writes with more power using simple, clear language. That\u2019s why I would refer Jessie Greengrass back to the sage advice of Al Stewart."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11277865-jessica", "userReview": "Edit: I read the entire Women's Prize Longlist last year (don't think I shall read them ALL this year, but a fair few for sure), and it's interesting to me that this is on there. I felt similarly about this as I did with 'First Love' by Gwendoline Riley, which made the shortlist last year, but I ended up enjoying every other book picked. We shall see!If you like either Rachel Cusk or Gwendoline Riley, I'd take a punt that you'd enjoy this. I don't particularly like Cusk from what I've read, and I certainly didn't like 'First Love' by Riley, so this is unfortunate. This is at times insightful, and the writing is consistently 'good' - it just isn't my type of novel. I felt a instant disconnect from our nameless narrator, and whilst I feel this is intentional, it made it hard for me to see the point in this book. Our narrator ruminates over different times in her life where she is a young child with a strange relationship with Grandmother 'Doctor K', a young woman caring for her ailing mother, a nervous expectant mother and a cautious first time mother. Interspersed throughout her musings of her life, our narrator also ponders on the lives of Freud and his daughter Anna, x-ray pioneer Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen and distinguished surgeon John Hunter. The inclusion of these real life'characters' are intended to serve the narrative, but for me just highlight how week the real bones of this story are.Thank you to John Murray and Netgalley for providing an eBook of this for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Matthias", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55179103-matthias", "userReview": "The narrator is the second time pregnant. In a language both concise and poetic we learn about herpregnancy, her parents and children, and the mystery of becoming a person. This is interwoven with reflections about scientific discoveries that helped to understand the human body and soul. Amazingly, the author succeeds in interweaving these narratives so that both success and failure in what we can know about ourselves remain in a balance: Discoveries can be exciting or sobering, remaining mysteries inspiring or frightening.This is one of these rare books that make me happy that I still read books. If I could, I would take a star or two away from every other book I have read last year and add it to this one."}, {"userName": "Tundra Morscheck", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43990165-tundra-morscheck", "userReview": "I think I read most of this book on the verge of tears and I\u2019m not feeling much better now. The atmosphere and language are exquisite.This is an extraordinary portrayal of a woman trying to make sense of her role as a daughter and granddaughter to two women (both deceased). It is full of regret for the inadequacy of her understanding of them and the questions she didn\u2019t ask. It is now her own time to weigh up the option of whether to become a mother and this decision is accompanied by a fear of being inadequate and the certainty that this child must be nurtured and raised to be their own person.\u201cOur lives are possibility reduced to rough particularity by contact, touch, and out of it the specificity of each of us come, so that to ask if we might have been better otherwise is to wish ourselves undone\u201dInterspersed within our narrators personal reflection she reveals three fascinating scientific stories of humans attempting to see and understand the human body.

Sight, very simplistically, is a pregnant woman\u2019s ambivalence towards motherhood rising from her own unconventional upbringing. It slides seamlessly between the narrator\u2019s life and the lives of historical figures responsible for the discovery of X-rays, the emergence of psychoanalysis and the birth of modern surgery for reasons that gradually become apparent. A smooth sinusoid - alternating between fact & fiction. The writing is incredibly fluid, poetic and stylised - long form sentences that flow like uninterrupted thoughts.~The 1st section delves into the life of Rontgen who discovered the X-Rays. Mirroring that, Jessie Greengrass creates an X-ray vision of her character. You\u2019re privy to her most intimate, personal thoughts without actually understanding her as a person (you don\u2019t even know her name). And this creates a very interesting juxtaposition between 'not knowing' the character and \u2018knowing' them. The discovery of X-Rays, a play on the \u2018Sight\u2019 of what is within - the sense of wonder in revealing what\u2019s beneath the surface.~The 2nd part explores the development of the theory of psychoanalysis. The personal link to the narrator being the fact that her grandmother was a practitioner herself. The relationship between the narrator and her grandmother, Dr. K, feels incredibly detached and impersonal. The dynamics between her mother, Dr. K and herself feel almost like 3 planetary bodies that exert a gravitational pull on one another but have their own distinct orbits. The impact of this experience on the narrator\u2019s own perception of motherhood made apparent.\u00a0~The third and final part, feels most personal and emotionally resonant of all. You flip between John Hunter\u2019s attempts to set modern surgery on a scientific footing, and the feelings the narrator harbours towards her unborn child. Her ambiguity that pans the entire book gains its much needed exposition toward the end, where she lays bear all her impending anxieties, vulnerabilities, her fears. The epiphany when she holds her newborn for the first time, and all the built-up dilemma dissolving in that intimately innocuous instant.~Sight isn\u2019t for everyone. There is barely any character development, and there\u2019s only a slim thread of a narrative. But it\u2019s one of the finest pieces of experimental literary fiction I\u2019ve ever read."}, {"userName": "Cassidy (Reminders of the Changing Time)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71490874-cassidy-reminders-of-the-changing-time", "userReview": "To see all of my book-related content, check out my blog @ http://bit.ly/2zzVt0RJessie Greengrass\u2019 Sight is completely introspective. It is plotless, and this may be a deal-breaker for some, but the just-under-200-pages are written in such a way that I honestly didn't even realise that, for the most part, nothing is actually happening. The dichotomy between the history of medicine (X-Rays, the birth of psychoanalysis, Victorian medical procedures) and the ruminations of the unnamed narrator around grief, motherhood and pregnancy are absolutely fascinating and made for a truly thought-provoking (and rather educational) read. The narrator debates arduously over the prospect of becoming a mother, an aspect of life that is often seen as an inevitability - women are told near-constantly that they should want to have children and this book made me feel comforted by the fact that doubts and fears in the face of the humongous life change are not completely alien.Head on over to http://bit.ly/2y7JSWV for this book, as well as all of the others featured in my reviews, complete with the added bonuses of free worldwide shipping and bringing a little joy to my life."}, {"userName": "Emily Louise Smith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5832744-emily-louise-smith", "userReview": "I really struggled to finish this book, and was so close to just DNFing and moving on with my life. The main draw for me was the fact that it was long listed for this years Women\u2019s Prize. I went in knowing little about it, which I thought would benefit my reading, as it seemed to be a tale of more a character driven point, rather than plot. I honestly thought it had neither.I found the writing to be over the top and self indulgent to the point of irritation. What Jessie Greengrass has written seems to be more a stream of sub conscience rather than a story in any format. The descriptions dragged on for lines and made it too much to be enjoyable and just came across as pretentious.I didn\u2019t like the use of a named narrator as in this case I felt complete disconnect to her and therefor lost interest in what she had to say. The passages I did enjoy the most were in part two and they were those concerning her relationship to her grandmother. However they were continually interrupted by backstory on Freud which totally threw me out of the narrative that I was finally getting sucked in to and made it unbearable to read, I eventually just started skipping these portions of the book as it added nothing for me personally and just made me more and more disenchanted with the whole thing.For such a short story (under 200 pages) it seemed to drag on as though it were 1000 page long. I liked the idea of the story going into in, however I feel like it needed a lot more editing as it reads a stream of inane ramblings, none that I personally felt were connected at all.*free copy received from Netgalley in exchange for honest review*"}, {"userName": "Anne Goodwin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23649662-anne-goodwin", "userReview": "How do we see inside ourselves and is it beneficial to do so?
