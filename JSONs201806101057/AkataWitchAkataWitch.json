Sunny is albino, which is just her luck since she wishes she could play soccer. But when Sunny is introduced to a secret society of \u2018\u2018juju\u2019\u2019 users, she realizes there might be a reason why she looks so different from her peers\u2014she possess powers that need developing. I simply adore the world-building. Unlike the summary lets on, Sunny and her new friends spend quite a small amount of time tracking the serial killer, seeing that as Leopard People, they are juggling two schools and they each must learn to understand their abilities and put them to good use, especially the new member\u2014Sunny. There is a beautiful sense of community when it comes to the Leopard People. It is original, because the author relies mainly on culture + magic to tell this tale. Without these two elements, there would be no story, and when beliefs are introduced, I, for one, pay great attention. Since this is fiction, the author does take liberties with the culture and the idea of ''juju'' or black magic, but Nnedi Okorafor sure has kindled in me a newfound interest in Africa.I\u2019ve seen many label this a \u2018\u2018young adult\u2019\u2019 book and perhaps they are right to do so, but I want to warn you that Sunny is twelve and the story has a juvenile vibe, although the tone is more serious than is the case with the majority of middle grade stories.

As you can guess, I\u2019m a sucker for all kinds of mythology, and this middle grade/YA fantasy is steeped in the myth and magic of Nigeria.Our main character is Sunny, a twelve-year-old girl born in the U.S. but recently moved to her parents\u2019 homeland of Nigeria. Sunny stands out in more ways than one \u2013 she\u2019s albino, she\u2019s a prodigy at soccer, and she\u2019s teased at school for being an akata (literally a \u2018wild animal\u2019) because she is from America. Sunny also has to deal with her family\u2019s complicated past. Her grandmother, whom Sunny never met, was a mysterious figure that Sunny\u2019s mother refuses to talk about, and Sunny\u2019s parents aren\u2019t exactly clear about why they decided to move Sunny back to Nigeria.Then one night during a blackout, Sunny stares into a candle\u2019s flame and sees a horrifying vision of the end of the world. This is the first sign that Sunny is not like other kids. Her powers have begun to awaken.Soon, Sunny makes three new friends who introduce her to the secret world of magic. There is Orlu, her classmate, a kind-hearted boy who has a natural talent for undoing juju spells. There is Chichi, a girl with a smart mouth and a quick wit, who doesn\u2019t go to school and lives in a tiny hut with her strange mother and hundreds of books. Then there is Sasha, an African American boy from Chicago, who was sent to Nigeria for corrective education after terrorizing his classmates back home with an evil spirit \u2013 a masquerade.Sunny learns that she is one of the Leopard People, a subset of humans who have strong links to the spirit world. The Leopards (as opposed to the Lambs, regular people) have their own society, with centers of juju learning throughout the world. In Nigeria, their town is called Leopard Knocks, and can only be reached by crossing an invisible bridge over a magical river.As Sunny begins to master her own powers, she realizes the world is a much more incredible and dangerous place than she imagined. Even the simplest lesson \u2013 like visiting a teacher\u2019s house in a forest \u2013 could be fatal \u2013 and Sunny quickly realizes that she and her three friends are being trained to work as a team for a vital mission. A serial killer is on the loose: Black Hat Otokoto, who is stealing and killing children, often removing their eyes in the process. If that\u2019s not creepy enough, Black Hat is secretly a powerful magician working the most evil kind of juju with human sacrifices. If Sunny and her friends can\u2019t stop him, Sunny\u2019s apocalyptic vision will come true. Can four young Leopard People master enough magic and learn to work together to stop a killer? The answer is by no means certain.The book\u2019s premise may sound familiar \u2013 a secret society of magic practitioners in the modern world, a group of friends who must master their powers to stop a terrible evil sorcerer. But don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that Leopard People vs. Lambs is just a takeoff on Wizards vs. Muggles, or Demigods vs. Mortals, or any number of other fantasies in which the heroes find they are special and magical. Sure, Akata Witch has some structural similarities (I particularly loved the fact that ADHD and dyslexia may be signs that you are a Leopard Person \u2013 great minds think alike, etc.) but Okorafor\u2019s book is firmly rooted in West African myth, which opens up a world as wondrous as Hogwarts but as different as pepper soup is from tea and crumpets.There are too many wonders in this book to describe them all: an artist wasp that builds sculptures out of crumbs and will sting you unless you praise its skill; a juju-powered bus called the funky train, driven by a fast-cussing man named Jesus\u2019s General; a sorceress who lives in a hut at the top of a palm tree; juju knives that can cut pockets out of the air, summon music or carve force fields; and horrible spirits called masquerades, who appear from termite mounds and wield powers so terrible they will kill you or drive you insane if not summoned properly.In the world of Leopard People, money is called chittim, and can only be gained by learning. Whenever you cast a new spell or find out something important about your powers, magic money literally falls from the sky \u2013 copper the most valuable, gold the least valuable. Any video game fan will appreciate the idea of coins appearing when you defeat an enemy, and personally I felt like chittim fell at my feet whenever I learned about a new monster, spirit or god from Nigerian myth \u2013 which happened a lot.I used to teach a unit on African folklore in my classroom, but it\u2019s such a huge subject I never really got to do it justice. We would read the animal fables of the Ashanti from Ghana and learn the adinkra symbols. We would read Yoruba myths from Nigeria and learn about the ancient gold-rich kingdoms. We would eventually work our way down to the DR Congo and I would tell the heroic epic of Mwindo from the Nyanga people (Nkuba the lightning hedgehog \u2013 best character ever). Still, there are so many cultures in West Africa alone, one could spend a whole year learning stories of gods and heroes and only scratch the surface.If you\u2019re tiring of knights, dragons and Merlin-type wizards and are interested in exploring a fresh and different world of magic, try Akata Witch. It\u2019s jam-packed with mythological wonders. Because it is so rich and so different from standard Euro-fantasy fare, some readers may take a little time getting oriented and keeping all the details straight, but it\u2019s well worth the journey. Best of all, the book hints at future adventures for Sunny and her friends. I can\u2019t wait to read more!"}, {"userName": "J.L.

Okorafor draws from Nigerian folk beliefs and rituals, and lets us into this world little by little as our protagonist discovers her own unique abilities. Some reviewers have compared the novel to J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book and (in terms of the plot) that doesn't seem so far off the mark.

It felt very much like book one of Harry Potter in terms of plot and situation, only milder and set in Nigeria.It shouldn't have felt milder. Objectively, there were child mutilations and a serial murderer on the loose. And there wasn't some gigantic castle with enchantments up to protect the students. So theoretically, if I were one of these four kids, I'd be creaming my pants.Brushing that aside, the setting is deeply fascinating to me, with magics very tied to the place and culture, with masks and masquerades and local spirits and demons and angels. The magic system was solid and cool, as were all the magical beasties.I didn't even mind the mirroring of HP elements popping up like clockwork... like everywhere... I just let myself enjoy the magic, the discovery, and the coming of age.Sometimes that's all you need to do. :) I think I might like to continue with the series.

Akata Witch soon pulled itself ahead of the other books in my tbr pile. If you like books about magic, particularly teens finding out they have special abilities, learning to use them, and building a community with others like them, this is the book for you. Added to those well-loved tropes is a new landscape with new traditions and rules. Setting it in Nigeria, with Igbo people but also Efik, allows for new magic, new histories, and more possibilities. I loved the character of Sunny, who starts out as an outsider for two reasons - she is albino, and while this is a noticeable character trait it also prevents her from social activities like football; she also was born in America and lived there most of her childhood. That is where the word \"akata\" comes from, it is a word that means something very negative.

Also, it goes the Percy Jackson route of explaining that what we call \"learning disabilities\" like ADD and dyslexia, are just bi-products of their uniqueness as magicians. The world building is fantastic. We often see magic from a European point of view and it was really cool to see this fresh take.Cons: When I was told that this story staring an Albino, Nigerian girl was a Harry Potter read alike, I didn't believe it until I started reading. Outsider to the magical community looking in. Juju knives instead of wands. Leopard Knocks instead of Diagion Alley. Lambs instead of Muggles. Etc. Etc. There's nothing wrong with being a Harry Potter read alike, except it suffers in the same place I think HP does. The climax is a show down with a final bad guy. We know its coming but that's basically all the build up for it. Mainly the story is about enjoying the novelty of Sunny's new magical life and the final conflict is jarringly thrown in at the end. We don't see how they were prepared for the final showdown and why it was them who had to do it. For me, the ending felt like it ran up and smacked me in the face.Still, I think I would recommend it overall. It's nice to see a unique female protagonist in a unique setting."}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "Born in New York City, but living in Nigeria, twelve-year-old Sunny feels like she\u2019s straddling two worlds.

One of the things I love about Okorafor's writing is the unique voice she brings to her stories. Her characters come alive easily for the reader, and they are all so individual and unique. Aside from anything else, this book does a great job delving into questions of identity. Although this is a typical theme for YA stories, it is also one that seems particularly important here. Sunny is confronted with understanding herself from many sides: her place as an American born Nigerian, a Leopard (or magically inclined) person born into a Lamb (or non-magical) family, a girl in a male dominated culture, and an albino on top of everything else.

I certainly remember returning from America to Nigeria at the age of ten, after seven years abroad, and encountering hostility and ridicule as an outsider, feeling as if I didn't really belong on any of the three continents I'd called home at one time or another, and finding my way mostly in the company of fellow misfits.\u00a0Akata Witch integrates these experiences neatly into a greater framework, ultimately grounding itself in the age-old storyline clash between earnest goodness and utter evil. Reading the book is a transporting experience but with a good deal of shocks and jolts that bring the narrative suddenly near at hand. I suspect I gained much particular enjoyment from the familiar flashes of tradition and language, but I suspect other less\u00a0familiar\u00a0readers would enjoy the same bits as flashes of exotic wonder without losing the story. No less an august commentator than\u00a0Ursula K. Le Guin said\u00a0\"There's more vivid imagination in a page of Nnedi Okorafor's work than in whole volumes of ordinary fantasy epics.\" \u00a0If you want a fresh take on novels about children immersed in a magical world, in a colorful and engaging setting, I highly recommend\u00a0Akata Witch."}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29336696-arlene", "userReview": "5 Damn Stars!THIS WAS SOOO GOOD!!!Honestly I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked this up, but it didn't take me long to realize what a gem I had stumbled upon. Okay so Sunny is an albino girl, of 12-ish, and she gets a glimpse of what is to happen in her world, but she isn't all the way sure of what she saw in the flames that night (not a spoiler, it's in the prologue). Normally she is reduced to name calling, being left out, picked on all because, kids are cruel, and albinism is not looked upon in the best of light but one day she meets Orlu and Chichi and they see something in her that she never knew existed. They take to her soon to be teacher, and initiate her into their world and there was no turning back. She finds out that she is part of a magical world that consists of Leopard people (magical folk) and that it has been passed down in her family to her. On the flip side of all this discovery, there is a problem happening in her village, where kids are being taken and are being killed, and it's not until later that a connection is made and Sunny and her friends (Chichi, Orlu and Sasha) are put on a path to stop him (Black Hat). This book is very reminiscent to that of Harry Potter, expect it takes place in Nigeria instead of the UK. There is a magic system, magical people, no wands (just juju knives), spells, and levels of mastery. This book is so visual that it would be a FANTASTIC movie or television series. It would blow people minds on all the imagery that Dr. Okorafor has put in this book. Sunny, as a main character is a wonderful girl!! She's smart, tough, athletic, and she doesn't let people get away with treating her like she doesn't belong just because she is a girl or an albino.

If you're looking for a good plot and sound characterisation, you can probably find better.In terms of setting, this book is fantastic: it's interesting, different and a nice change from the super-Euro default setting of most urban fantasy novels. The world-building, although we're not shown much outside of the character's immediate area, is fantastic and gives a good impression of what the global situation is in this universe, not just the local one.The novel also focuses on female characters, and their families play an important (if background) role to the story. The characters themselves are fairly diverse, with Igbo as well as other tribes represented, and physical traits like albinism appearing alongside mental ones like dyslexia. So that was nice! As someone with dyslexia, I found the depiction of it to be a little baffling, but the fact it is even shown was nice.However, while the world-building is great, I found the plot weak and the characters unbelievable. The adult characters are all alternatively useless and terrible, and the children are placed with an absurd amount of responsibility for no discernible reason - although the older characters consistently say they'll explain later, you'll never get an explanation worth the suspension of belief. Even a pokey explanation would have been better, because the alternative is that all the adult characters come across as mildly psychopathic, and/or possibly trying to kill and/or tramuatise these kids in the weirdest, most off-handed way.The child protagonists aren't much better. Their personalities are not very well defined - apart from his casual sexism, it's hard for me to think of ways that Sunny, the protagonist, is different from her young schoolmate Orlu. Part of this is because the characters don't really grow throughout the novel. They undergo a number of different tramuatising events, but they never actually experience consequences - for example, although a man is killed directly in front of them and the children are all horrified, they get over it in a handful of pages and it is never mentioned again. This is a consistent theme throughout the book, and is exemplified in the final scenes. Things may happen to the characters, but if they're not affected by them, then what's the point?Finally, as the most minor issue, I found the book's handling of American blacks to be slightly strange. The primary protagonist is from America, but identifies primarily as Nigerian throughout the book, which is not the issue. The problem is that the only American who identifies as such is Sasha, who is a juvenile delinquent who refers to himself \"as a descendent of slaves and such\", cracks jokes about soul food, \"cornbread, fried chicken and collared greens\" and whom other characters constantly talk about his weird, girly name. Any of those traits by themselves would be fine, but when he is also the only character that continuously brings up racism and those are all his defining characteristics, it gets weird."}, {"userName": "TheSkepticalReader", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-theskepticalreader", "userReview": "3.5 starsThere\u2019s something about Nnedi Okorafor\u2019s writing that is extremely engrossing.

Let's discuss the elephant in the room. Akata Witch has been nicknamed the African (Nigerian) Harry Potter. While there are some influences, overall this story respects the cultural magic realism hailing from Nigeria and other African countries. Hate to break this truth to some readers, but J.K. Rowling doesn't hold the copyright to magical realism in books, particularly when you see cultural aspects she nicked for her stories. But, we'll save that pot of tea for another discussion.As the blurb states, 12-year Sunny is a Nigerian-American, living in Nigeria with her parents after living in the U.S. for nine years. She's an outcast - an Akata or \"wild animal\" - not only because of her ethnicity and birth country, but because of her albinism. Deep down, she's a normal kid, enjoying soccer (football), getting good grades and suffering from school bullies. But, as she reaches deeper into her soul, there's a calling within her soul she cannot tag.\u00a0She meets to fellow kids, Orlu and Chichi (another kid, Sasha, an African-American, joins the group) and they discover their souls are intertwined for greater roles some of they knew, but still couldn't imagine. They form a leopard coven (lambs equate to muggles, if you insist on following the HP world) and with training, find themselves battling an evil rogue using children and ritual killing to bring on a vicious spirit.Will she accept her gifted fate? Or, will she cower and decide being ordinary's not so bad?Nnedi Okorafor clearly writes with love as she showcases rich and varied Nigerian traditions within magical realism. I'm not Nigerian. In fact, I do not know where my African heritage descends (Another story for another day). Okorafor schools me on foods, language, and aspects of her culture better than any documentary.\u00a0Furthermore, she paints the landscape strong. I see the dust, mud, and urbane landscapes with Leopard Knocks (Okay, her version of Diagon Alley. Give it a rest!). Yet, while the latter's fictional, those markets described in Akata Witch are real with a magical spin.Additional, each kid she created holds their own personality. None of them blur. They stand distinct (although Sasha worked a nerve or two for me). They are spirited and melancholic, joyous and angry. They realize the hardcore job ahead and all encompassing it.While rough in some areas (mainly, reading about the ritual killing and maiming), this story presents fantasy, a genre which I tend to shy from, in a palatable manner and I cannot wait to read the next book in her series, Akata Warrior.However, while I highly recommend this story, AW has one glitch: the ending. The battle's way too short for the amount of build-up presented. But, given Okorafor's series, my inpatient self will have to move on the next book. While fantasy's lack of diversity speaks volumes - I mean, you can create blue fairies but not people based on real folks - this is a story worthy of reading.\u00a0Adapt this book into a movie...stat.Verdict: 4.5/5 Chittems (Read the book to get the reference)\u00a0*Thanks to Penguin's First Reads Program for an honest and unbiased review*"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123475-jim", "userReview": "I finished reading Nnedi Okorafor's YA fantasy Akata Witch on the flight to Colorado last week.

But none of these elements are new or unique to Harry Potter, and Okorafor\u2019s story and worldbuilding are a refreshing change from most \u201cmagical teenager\u201d stories.I loved the characters, all of whom have distinctive personalities and voices, from Chichi\u2019s bluntness to Sasha\u2019s rebelliousness and American sensibilities to the different mentors and teachers Sunny meets. I also appreciated the excerpts from Fast Facts for Free Agents, a rather condescending but informative book about people like Sunny, who have non-magical parents. The book-in-a-book does a nice job of helping orient the reader while doing the same for Sunny.It\u2019s not all magic and soccer and fun, of course. Sunny\u2019s world is harsh and unforgiving. The artistic wasp who creates a new sculpture each day will also sting you if you\u2019re not suitably appreciative. Sunny risks being caned for disobeying the rules of magic, and her lessons are potentially deadly. At home, Sunny lives with an abusive father (making this the second YA book in a row I\u2019ve read with an abusive father.) And then there\u2019s Black Hat, a man who\u2019s been murdering children, and whose magic is far stronger than that of Sunny or her friends\u2026The book is steeped in Nigerian culture and folklore, and recognizes real-world tensions and conflicts without ever feeling preachy. There\u2019s a brief reference to 419 scams, acknowledgement of racism and prejudice in Nigeria and the U.S., and more.My only nitpicks would be that the final confrontation with Black Hat felt a little quick, and I was disappointed to not see more of a resolution between Sunny and her father. But neither of these things took away from my enjoyment.Like I said at the beginning of this review, I recommended this book a number of times over the weekend, and I\u2019ll recommend it again. It\u2019s a good story, well-written, with great characters and magic. And I\u2019m happy to say that Okorafor has confirmed there will be additional books in this series.Also recommended: A review of Akata Witch that discusses the cultural context and references in ways I\u2019m not able to do, at http://igbocybershrine.com/2011/03/02..."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/642041-sarah", "userReview": "This is a lovely YA novel. It contains some similarities to the author's adult novel, Who Fears Death: a strong female protagonist who is just coming into her own power; a band of young friends who need to take on a larger evil; an African setting (far-future Sudan in that case, present day Nigeria in this one). If I remember correctly, both also begin with first-person sequences in which the protagonist gets a hint of her own power, and then segue into third-person for the remainder of the book. In both cases I get the impression that the story may have been written in first person and then changed to third in a subsequent draft.There are a lot of similarities to Harry Potter as well, which is just to say that the book uses the touchstones of the YA-fantasy genre to tell a story that is entirely its own. A young girl named Sunny plays the role of the child who discovers that she has access to a magical world that goes unseen by the mundane majority. She is Harry Potter and Hermione rolled into one: smart, good at sports, self-conscious about her appearance, the child of two non-magical parents. She's an American-Nigerian, a Free Agent, and an albino, traits which combine to make her an outsider wherever she goes. Sunny is a great character and role model for young readers. The modern Nigerian setting and the infusions of West African folklore and culture are a welcome change from Europe and dragons and magic wands."}, {"userName": "Becky Schneider", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky-schneider", "userReview": "So, first of all, holy crap, a fantasy novel about an albino girl in Nigeria that doesn't spend its time exoticizing albinism or Africa! (I could have simply written, holy crap, a fantasy novel about an albino girl in Nigeria, but the fact that it was done right made me really happy.)This book's greatest strength is definitely the worldbuilding. I loved the magic and magical community in this book; Harry Potter comparisons can be made simply because both authors have a flair for inventing vivid details that make their worlds come alive.Its plot is run-of-the-mill - girl on the cusp of adolescence discovers she's a witch and saves the world with her best friends. However, the author is aware of the tropes with which she's working, and she really does sell the coming-of-age story by making us appreciate how much the protagonist still does not know about her world by the end of the novel, and how much lies before her.Along with the worldbuilding, the book's scope was probably my favorite thing about this novel - Okorafor's wisdom in realizing that a story about a twelve-year-old girl should not have a closed ending but should feel like there's so much more to come, even if there will be no sequels."}, {"userName": "Dani - Perspective of a Writer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7476091-dani---perspective-of-a-writer", "userReview": "Check out more reviews @ Perspective of a Writer...I found Sunny really easy to follow... her voice was readable and likable. And I especially enjoyed her friendship with Orlu who tried to defend her as well as introduced her to his neighbor Chichi.The beginning was a little slow but got going once Leopard juju magic became involved. I was quite enthralled with the development of the magic and the little rituals that made up the juju. The idea of leopard spirits and spirit faces was a fascinating one and I really felt like I was getting to know some of the African culture, which, incidentally, is really cool.Not a big fan of the large info dumps to give us facts... BUT the plot was decently done and showcased the details that the author created. And it was a huge plus that the magic had real explanations! Not necessarily well written or well plotted she is gifted at giving the right detail from the right character!

They can't exist in the spirit world.\"Sunny lives in Nigeria, but she was born in America. She is both Nigerian and American. An outsider who belongs. Sunny is different from her family in more ways than one. She\u2019s albino, but she has also seen the end of the world in the flame of a candle. She\u2019s a free agent\u2014 a Leopard Person who is not from a family of Leopard People. She has no knowledge of the magic that flows within her or the spirit world that is both her friend and enemy. There\u2019s a serial killer pillaging the streets and killing kids and it\u2019s up to her and three new friends to stop him. This is unique. When I requested this novel, I hadn\u2019t realized that Nnedi Okorafor was the author of Binti, a hugely popular scifi that has been sweeping the book world by storm. This is my first time reading Okorafor\u2019s work and it will not be my last. The writing is beautiful and the storytelling is rich. Okorafor merges the world of Nigeria with the hidden world of Leopard Knocks seamlessly. The imagery is stunning and one of my favorite things about Akata Witch was the excerpts from the book about Free Agents. We learned about Leopard People as Sunny does and it puts the reader on equal footing with Sunny. It makes the story more intimate because the reader develops relationships and knowledge as the main protagonist does. It\u2019s a wonderful, well-developed story full of magic, mischief, and innocence.Whimsical Writing Scale: 4.75The main female character is Sunny. Sunny is a very young protagonist; she\u2019s only twelve-years-old. She doesn\u2019t know much about the world and her thoughts can feel a little silly, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that Sunny is experiencing a world that is unfamiliar to her. This is a world that children know about since birth if they are born into it and this world is also brutal. There\u2019s a scene towards the end where Sunny and her friends attend a wrestling match that results in someone dying. It\u2019s very brutal for a child to see this, but her teacher was teaching them a valuable lesson\u2014 a lesson that becomes important to their task of defeating Black Hat. I really enjoyed Sunny as a character and I guess I have developed a maternal affection for her. I want to see her succeed in learning about and navigating this new world, but I also want her to be safe. If this series follows Sunny throughout her teen years, I know she\u2019ll grow into a badass woman.Kick-Butt Heroine Scale: 4.5The other characters in Sunny\u2019s friend group are integral to this story. Without her friends, Sunny wouldn\u2019t know of her true self or be able to embrace who she really is. There\u2019s ChiChi, Orlo, and Sasha. ChiChi is a wonderful character with a lot of spunk and heavy doses of snark. She\u2019s fierce, but reckless. She\u2019s very bright for her age (whatever that age may be), but she\u2019s also too cocky. It puts her and others at danger, but this characterization makes ChiChi authentic and feel real. Orlo is Sunny\u2019s classmate at the Lamb school (Lambs are outsiders who are not Leopard People, non-magic folk) and he comes to her aid after several fights. He has the unique talent of mending things that are undone and he\u2019s reserved. Orlo calculates situations and doesn\u2019t make rash decisions without thinking about them. He adheres to the rules of the Leopard People and doesn\u2019t believe they should be pushed or broken. Sasha is from the United States and is outsider in Nigeria, but a Leopard Person through and through. He has a lot of power for being young, but he is reckless and has a vendetta against authority figures. He doesn\u2019t respect those with power and believes that rules are meant to broken. He\u2019s definitely rebellious, but he isn\u2019t a bad person. He just makes a lot of foolish and bad decisions, but most young kids do. Together the four children have a strong bond and they are definite friendship goals. Anatov is their mentor and teacher. He\u2019s wise and does a lot questionable things, but the lessons always outweigh the risks. Messing with juju is dangerous and it can lead to death; Anatov doesn\u2019t let the kids forget it and leads them to many missions that can harm them. I also really enjoyed the balancing of Sunny\u2019s family life with her new life. Her relationship with her mother, especially towards the end, takes a new shift and brought a smile upon my face.Character Scale: 5The Villain- Black Hat is a serial killer who targets children. He takes limbs and seems to be practicing some type of ritual sacrifice. It is revealed later on that he has a role in the Leopard Knocks society and an even bigger part to the end of the world that Sunny has seen.Villain Scale: 4My only problem, and it\u2019s a bit of a big one, is the ending. The ending felt rushed and the big battle showdown wasn\u2019t as climactic as the novel kept building it up to be. It felt a little too convenient and everything just worked out so well. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t give this novel a full 5 stars, but I\u2019m really excited about the sequel to Akata Witch and I know that this will be a series I don\u2019t want to miss.Plotastic Scale: 4.5Cover Thoughts: This cover is fierce. It\u2019s intense and I really like it. Although I must admit I love and prefer the hardcover because it captures Sunny\u2019s innocence. This girl on the cover isn\u2019t Sunny until the end of the novel. It feels a little too mature, but it\u2019s still a well-done cover.Thank you, First to Read and Speak, for chance to read this novel in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "For a fantasy set in Nigeria, involving not only magic but violent serial murders, this book was remarkably dull. There was a lot of walking and expositing, and the setting, which could have been excitingly different from the genre-fallbacks, was oddly blank. Except for specific things which were described, I didn't get much sense of place. But my main complaint was the characters. I vaguely disliked most of them, but overall found them flat. Even when a teacher puts them in mortal danger they come across as slightly annoyed rather than frightened or furious. I gave up at the scene where the kids are remarking with no perceptible emotion (fear, pity, disgust, give me something) on the kidnapping, torture and mutilation of a seven-year-old."}, {"userName": "Sue (Hollywood News Source)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6511257-sue-hollywood-news-source", "userReview": "I feel like it\u2019s been forever since I read a non-romance book that I heartily devoured. Akata Witch is an enchanting introduction to a series that has great potential to be mainstream. Okorafor swiftly establishes an expansive world-building in a way the reader could easily follow. This is why a lot of fantasy novels have been hit or miss for me lately; it\u2019s difficult to follow the semantics of a story when an author just casually info dumps you. I always strive for gradual and natural build up. Akata Witch perfectly fits my standard.The story follows Sunny, a twelve-year-old albino girl who grew up in New York, but migrated to her parent\u2019s homeland in Nigeria. She suddenly discovers, she\u2019s part of a secret society of Leopard, which are the western\u2019s contemporary version of witches. There, she\u2019ll meet Orlu, Chichi, and Sasha who\u2019ll help her settle in with her newfound abilities.My favorite is Sunny\u2019s camaraderie with her new friends. They\u2019re group of four with clashing personalities; It\u2019s fun to see them grow closer with one another other. Another delightful part is to see the heroine discover this magical society. Okorafor sculpted an exquisite terrifying world that I, too, would love to visit. We get to see Sunny becomes stronger. I love the dialogue, the magical plot. Akata Witch would be a fantastic movie franchise or TV series. I can\u2019t wait to see how the story would unfold for Sunny and her friends.

And yet almost none of that appears. This book was written appropriately. Sunny's albinoism is important only in that it makes her special amongst the Leopard people, or juju (magic) -wielders. Nnedi doesn't preach about what it means to be a Nigerian woman, albino, or an American in Nigeria in a world where these things are often looked down upon. Instead, these are aspects of Sunny's life and only brought up when it mattered. I love the world building in Akata Witch. Nnedi knows her Nigerian culture and folklore inside and out. I have relatively little experience with Nigerian culture aside from what I have gleaned from reading Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's works. But Nnedi's characters and their experiences parallel those so closely, I feel like I am starting to better understand the culture. While I don't agree with the male supremacy over women and the idea of caning poorly behaved children, it's obvious this is part of the Nigerian culture. Also, the world building involving juju and the Leopard People feels natural. As Sunny and her peers are learning about juju from the Scholars so it the reader. It doesn't feel preachy. As much of the learning is done through explanation as experience. The characters are a ton of fun. Our quartet of students all bring their own unique qualities. Chichi is blunt and aggressive, steeped in Leopard People culture and Nigerian traditions. Sasha is rebellious and unabashed, as only someone who grew up in America should be. Orlu is the quiet, soft-spoken peacemaker and well-respected leader. All in all, this was an incredibly enjoyable book. I could have had another 150-200 pages of Sunny's learning and worldbuilding and still been happy. I recently learned that this originally stand-alone novel will become a duology in late 2017, and that's pretty exciting to me. There is so much left unexplored in this world. I can't wait to explore it more and see what else Nnedi has in store for us."}, {"userName": "Donalyn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/829035-donalyn", "userReview": "So much fun!
