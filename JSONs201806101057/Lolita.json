He\u2019s a paedophile.\u201dA bit taken aback, I enquired further, \u201cWho? The author or the character?\u201dFortunately, she replied, \u201cThe character.\u201dFor me, this exchange showed how much \u201cLolita\u201d can still sharply divide opinion, even within lovers of fiction.This wasn\u2019t the conversation I had been hoping for.I had read \u201cLolita\u201d in a couple of days, less time than my work commitments normally allow me, but I found it incredibly easy to read.Even though I was taking notes, even though I was conscious that Nabokov was playing games (even if I didn\u2019t always know what game), even though there were unfamiliar words I should have looked up, I was constantly drawn towards the conclusion.I wanted to talk to someone about my experience straight away.My cheeks were still flushed, my nerve endings were still tingling, I had experienced the \u201cspine thrill of delight\u201d, I felt like I had just had sex with a book.Now, not being a smoker, all I needed was some post-coital conversation.And there was no one around to converse with.And the book wasn\u2019t giving away any more of its secrets than it already had.Nor was it going to tell me I had been a Good Reader or that it had appreciated my attentiveness.It was back between the covers, challenging me to start again.Three Act Word PlayAt a superficial level, \u201cLolita\u201d is a relatively straight-forward novel.Once you know that it concerns sexual relations between 37 year old Humbert Humbert and 12 year old Dolores \u201cLolita\u201d Hayes, you just about know the plot.There\u2019s a beginning, a middle and an end.A grooming, a consummation, an aftermath.Nabokov makes of his material a three act play.And he does so playfully, seductively, lyrically, charmingly, amusingly, dangerously.To this day, I cannot look at Humbert\u2019s initials \u201cH.H.\u201d without pronouncing them in German, \u201cHa Ha\u201d, and wondering whether the joke is on us.Beneath the skin of the novel, there is much more.There is a whole complex living organism.You can lose yourself within its arms for days, weeks, months, a lifetime.As long as your love of wordplay, your love of words and play, will permit you.Again, at a superficial level, there is an almighty conflict between morality and aesthetics happening between the pages.Whether or not Nabokov deliberately put the conflict there, he put the subject matter there.We, the readers, can supply our own conflict in the way we read his novel.Nabokov knew the subject matter would inflame us, if not our desires, then at least our morals, our sense of righteousness.Morality and aesthetics are intertwined within the fabric of the novel.They embrace each other in one long death roll, just like Humbert Humbert and Clare Quilty.We watch their interaction, open-mouthed, open-minded, but ultimately they have to be pulled apart or separated.When they are together, they are one.When they are apart, they are each other\u2019s double.The Morality of the StoryThere is no doubt that sexual relations between an adult and a minor are not just immoral, but criminal as well.That is an unquestionable fact.From a legal point of view, the motive of the adult is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.The consent of the minor is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.If Humbert had been charged with an offence of sexual relations with a minor, he would have had no legal defence.Any question as to whether Lolita really seduced Humbert would have been irrelevant.In fact, the evidence might not even have been admissible, except potentially as part of the determination of the penalty.In other words, even if it was relevant to penalty, it was not relevant to guilt.Because morality is a social construct that depends on collective endorsement, he had no moral defence either.The personal views of the individual are not really that relevant to society\u2019s determination that an act is immoral.The choice of the individual is to comply or offend.Of Traps and CagesHumbert offended not just once, but untold numerous times over two years.He carefully planned his seduction, he set his trap, he caught his prey, even if someone might want to argue that this 12 year old seductress walked voluntarily into the trap.Having freed Lolita from the trap, he imprisoned her in a cage, and repeated his crime.Again, someone could argue that she had plenty of opportunities to flee the cage (which she eventually did).But Humbert surrounded Lolita with an elaborate system of self-doubt that convinced her that she would become a ward of the state if they were found out.The Legality of the Confession\u201cLolita\u201d is written from Humbert\u2019s point of view.It is not just a recollection in his mind, it is a formal, written document.He sat down and wrote it in 56 days between his capture in 1952 (charged only with the crime of murdering Clare Quilty) and his death in prison before his trial could occur.For me, the written document is a fascinating choice of literary device to tell the story.The document becomes a book within a book.While Nabokov obviously wrote it, all that he purports to do is sandwich it between a Foreword and a (much later) Afterword.This device sets up an interesting relationship between Humbert and the reader.For Humbert, it is akin to a confession or a witness statement.To this extent, what he confesses to is clearly enough to convict him of the crime of murder.However, in it, he also sets out details of crimes that, for whatever reason, he was never charged with.If his lawyer had read the document while he was still alive, he would probably have excised all of the other confessions, because they would have prejudiced his client\u2019s case (at least with respect to penalty).The Role of the JuryFor the reader, the confession defines our relationship to the events that are described.We are cast in the role of a member of the Jury.This device allows heinous moral and criminal acts to be described and read and examined within a legal and therefore legitimate framework.In a sense, the book becomes a report of sorts on legal proceedings.We become legitimate observers and listeners to something that might otherwise have been prurient and offensive and illegal.Yet, we have to do our duty and participate in the legal process, because it is an important part of the justice system.Even though we have a legitimate interest in participating, I wonder whether we are still voyeuristic.Nabokov has trapped us in a game that persuades us that it is serious, but ends up being just as playful and perverse as the subject matter of the crime.In a way, Nabokov makes us complicit in a crime, if not Humbert\u2019s crime, then perhaps our own thought crime.It is also material that, by the time Humbert\u2019s confession is read, both Humbert and Lolita have died of natural causes.Humbert speaks from the other side of death.Nobody is alive, nobody can be hurt any more than they already have.The Confessions of an Unreliable Narrator (The Fox and the Peacock)I explored these issues, because I wanted to understand Humbert\u2019s motivation for his confession.He is effectively pleading guilty.I don\u2019t see any prospect for an insanity defence, even though he seemed to have been in and out of sanatoria at times of crisis.Equally, I don\u2019t think that anything he reveals would reduce the penalty for the murder.To do so, he only needed to focus on his concern that Quilty had wronged Lolita in some way even worse than his own actions.But to confess all of these other crimes seems to be counter-productive.Similarly, I don\u2019t think he was lying about the detail, I think that he was telling the truth, and that he was telling the truth, so that he could be understood, no more, no less.Humbert\u2019s confession is not just the fiction of a dirty old man, it is not false or fabricated, it is not a mirage.No matter how immoral, no matter how deluded, no matter how selfish and narcissistic, it is his fact, his reality, his truth, his burden, his shame.His actions were the pursuit of a rational man, not an insane one.He was film-star handsome, educated, intellectual, talented, witty, charming, calculating, calculated, dangerous.There is no doubt that he was a talented performer, an exceptional player.However, Humbert is not an actor wearing a mask, performing some other fictional character or version of himself.I believe that we are seeing him for what he really is.He is as cunning, tricky, sly as a fox and as refined, elaborate, attractive as a peacock.His decoration, his ornamentation is part of him, his life, his loins, his sin, his soul.In pursuit of Lolita, he was prepared to lie and deceive in order to achieve his goal.I don\u2019t believe that he was prepared to lie to us, if only because there was no point in lying.When occasionally he questions the veracity of his own account, it is solely to question the accuracy of his memory.However, he didn\u2019t need to tell lies to achieve leniency, he didn\u2019t need to tell the truth for some ulterior motive.By confessing to anything, he would only be found guilty of crimes he hadn\u2019t been charged with in addition to the charge of murder he had been accused of.There was no point in confessing to anything extra, other than to tell the truth as he saw it.It wasn\u2019t going to get him any sympathy or reduce his penalty, if anything, his disclosures would aggravate his penalty.To this extent, I don\u2019t consider Humbert an \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d.I realise that some might respond that paedophiles are habitual liars and can\u2019t help themselves.That might well be the case, but I think it is our horror at his crime, our moral judgment affecting our assessment of the whole of the person and shaping our (aesthetic) response to the book and the character.Perhaps naively, I want to find some good in him.Ultimately, whether or not Humbert\u2019s love was morally wrong, I believe that he wanted us to understand his love and what he learned about his love by the end of his story.What We Talk about When We Talk about Humbert\u2019s LoveTechnically, the sexual relations between Humbert and Lolita are not an example of \u201cpaedophilia\u201d (which is a sexual preference for a pre-pubescent).While nothing moral or legal turns on the distinction, the sexual relations constitute \u201chebephilia\u201d (which is a sexual preference for a person in the early stage of puberty).The name derives from \u201cHebe\u201d, the Greek goddess of youth.Her name means youth or prime of life, and she personified both youth and immortality.She was the cup bearer who served nectar to the Olympian Gods to give them everlasting youth.First Part (Obsessive Love)For me, during the first part of the book, Humbert\u2019s love was forbidden, but genuine.It was a transgressive love, in that it was a love of the particular aesthetic form that youth takes between the ages of ten and fifteen.The body is at its most perfect, it has not started to age, to wrinkle, to fill out, to droop, to deteriorate.After that age, the body starts to age, and he finds that physically unattractive (as in the case of his first wife and Lolita's mother).OK, we all make choices about our love objects.How can we account for our choices?There\u2019s no accounting for love.Still, at the heart of this aesthetic approach to love is a fear or disgust at aging and mortality.There is an unreality, a lack of understanding and acceptance of the cycle of life and death, a Peter Pan desire to stay forever young, forever immortal.I also think there is a self-love or narcissism inherent in this aesthetic view.I love the young, because I love the perfect form of my own youth.Since my youth, I have fallen, morally and physically.I therefore have to preserve the visage of my own youth.I wonder whether it is only possible to have this view if you have never had your own biological child.Parenthood is an education in the reality of aging.It is an illusion to believe that you can live and defeat it.But tell that to the cosmetics industry.So far I have talked of love in the abstract.In the first part of the book, I struggled to understand Humbert\u2019s love and the above is what I came up with.I won\u2019t say I had a sympathy for him, but I think I understood him and his love.I even understood his obsessiveness.How many of us, during the first throes of love, trap and oppress our love object, so much so that we are not able to see how oppressive we were, until after the relationship has been consummated, or morphed into something more mature or ended?However, things started to change at the end of the first part (the consummation) and into the second part (the imprisonment).Of course the love had to be consummated, but as unexceptional as the description of the event was, it highlighted the reality that the first part was a trap for Lolita to walk into.As playful and lyrical as the language might have been, it was sinister in intent.Second Part (Captivating Love)During the second part, having captured Lo, Humbert makes it clear that his love will last no more than three years, to be precise, 1 January, 1947 to 1 January, 1950, which are effectively her 12th to 15th birthdays.After this, statistically at least, Lo will morph out of her nymphet form.So Humbert's love is solely for a definitive phase of her entire life, after which he expects and intends to abandon her.During this phase, Humbert\u2019s goal is to maintain Lolita in captivity, to ensure her availability for him alone. There is no fairy tale promise of \u201chappily ever after\u201d or \u201c\u2019til death do us part\u201d in this love action.There is no love or concern for the other, only selfishness and narcissism.I have tried to view the definition of beauty that appeals to Humbert as an aesthetic issue.I have tried to divorce it from morality, so I can understand it better.However, whether I think of it in terms of aesthetics or morality, obsession or love, the fact that it could be switched on and off at such identifiable times turned me against Humbert.He is in control of this feeling called love, at least, he knows with clinical precision when he will return to \u201cnormality\u201d or a state of not loving.His love was a drug that he took too knowingly, he knew precisely when the feeling of the drug would wear off.So, I started to believe that there was no loss of self in his love.Instead, it was a heightened or gross act of narcissism.By extension, there was no sense in which he tried to \"satisfy\" Lo personally or sexually.There was no sense of a mutually satisfying relationship or intercourse (although to be fair, he doesn't go into the sexual detail, except in terms of physical exertion).However, I got the sense that, when it came to consummating his love, it was just about sticking his dick into his love object.OK, lots of sexual relationships can be reduced to this fundamental penetrative act.Some men see femaleness as no more than a receptacle for maleness and its fluid manifestation, the cup into which they spill their seed.However, I started to feel in the second part that Humbert's aim was to defile or despoil the beauty that had appealed to him in the first part (even if it was transgressive).And the three year zone of enchantment highlighted to me that Humbert would just go in search of the next beautiful nymphet to stick his dick into.So it became increasingly apparent to me that he was a serial despoiler of beauty, not a genuine lover or admirer of beauty.There is a hatred or disgust hotwired into this love.You don't normally hate the flowers in your vase when it comes time to remove them and throw them in the dustbin.But you get the sense that Humbert would have been disgusted by his former love objects, his objet d'obsession, the moment that calendar clicked over.Obviously, this same disgust or loss of interest appears in more traditional relationships.It could lie behind the mid-life crisis when the guy runs away with the younger woman.It could explain the inability to accept the inevitability of aging, at least in our partner.It could explain we males who still picture ourselves as the immutable 20 year old who deserves a young and nubile partner (no matter how soft or old or fat or ugly we have become).So Humbert\u2019s love can teach the rest of us something about our own love.Last Part (Adult Love Denied)I wrote most of my comments about the second part before I had finished reading the last part of the novel.I have to emphasise that most of what turned me against Humbert came from my reaction to his own words.Neither he nor Nabokov held back the material that would make me hate him.Still, I read on, firmly in their constrictive embrace, until chapter 29, when Humbert and the seventeen year old, married and pregnant Dolores meet again.What you think of Humbert and his love, whether or not you think he is lying, depends on your interpretation of the confessions in this chapter:\u201c\u2026there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, rope-veined narrow hands and her gooseflesh white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was (my Lolita!), hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby\u2026 and I looked and I looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else\u2026\u201cWhat I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart\u2026had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, all that I cancelled and cursed\u2026\u201cYou may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until I am gagged and half-throttled, I will shout my poor truth.\u201cI insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale and polluted, and big with another\u2019s child, but still gray-eyed, still sooty-lashed, still auburn and almond, still Carmencita, still mine.\u201dThis is just one part of Humbert\u2019s journey.He realised that he still loved her outside the hebephile zone.However, he still clung to \u201chis\u201d Lolita, the Lolita of his deluded version of love.Obviously, Dolores is and never was \u201chis\u201d version of reality, she was her own person, and she declines his love a second time.Only then does he recognise that he \u201cdid not know a thing about [his] darling\u2019s mind\u201d or that \u201ca North American girl-child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac\u201d.Then he quotes \u201can old poet\u201d (presumably Nabokov himself):\u201cThe moral sense in mortals is the duty\u201cWe have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.\u201dIn other words, you can\u2019t just indulge an aesthetic sense of beauty at the expense of a real human being, it comes attached to and constrained by morality.Morality, taboo and the law work together to protect innocence and beauty from those who would defile and despoil it.He was not above the law, he was no Nietzschian Superman.He was the fool in his own play.The TragedyThere are suggestions that Nabokov saw Humbert\u2019s story as a tragedy, that Humbert only realised that he genuinely loved Dolores by conventional standards when it was too late.That might be so, but Humbert only had himself to blame.He was a victim of his own hand, and his tragedy was nothing compared with the one he made Dolores endure, so that he, too selfishly for love, could have his \u201cLolita\u201d."}, {"userName": "Stepheny", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7091879-stepheny", "userReview": "Once, a long time ago I was an 11 year old girl. I did not always appear my age, nor act it. I was long and lean and blonde and full of the confidence that only a young child can exude. Me, circa 1998. A ripe 11 years old thinking I was to be America\u2019s Next Top Model. Ha!It was around this time that my body began raging with hormones and ideas about boys and love. I was introduced to sex at a young age. My sister being 4 years my elder thought she should show me the ways of the world. And boy did she introduce me to a whole lot. Beer, cigarettes, make-up, older boys and of course the birds and the bees. But I was a weird kid. (I know, I\u2019m a weird adult too. Funny how that works..) I was always just outside the social realms of the cool kids. I wasn't quite nerdy enough for the nerds either. I fell somewhere in the middle and made a lot of people uncomfortable. There were a select few who understood me and my slightly-off personality. Me circa 2000 at the age of 13.One thing that can be said is that I was always willing to laugh and to make others laugh. I was wild and free. I cared little what others thought and went wholly into every endeavor.Me around the age 13 still. And yes, I am riding a sled down a slide in the middle of summer because why not?It was when I was 14 that a lot in my life changed. There was an older guy who hung around my house with my sister\u2019s friends and who paid a lot of attention to yours truly. He laughed at my corny jokes, smiled at me frequently and I noticed how often he was caught staring at me. The long story of it is far too long and complicated.What I will tell you is this: he was 22 I was 14. Not quite the age gap that Lolita and Humbert shared but enough of one to piss a lot of people off. Growing up in a small town everyone knows everyone and this guy knew my family for a while. Nothing but the best intentions. We had something special and my parents did what a lot of parents do- they tried to advise and deter me. They saw they weren't getting anywhere and decided to let it play out for a bit thinking he would get bored and move on.He changed from the sweet and charming guy he was around everyone else to a controlling and abusive asshole when we were on our own. He manipulated me into thinking it was my fault; that I caused him to react that way. That I was flirtatious with that clerk, or hanging out with guys at my sister\u2019s house, or putting on a show for everyone as a cheerleader. He demeaned me every chance he got and a few times things did get physical. It was after he broke my heart by breaking up with me that his true colors really came through. He attacked my male best friend who was helping me through the devastation of my first real heartbreak. He called me all hours of the night convincing me to sneak off and have sex with him again. Which, of course I did because I was completely head over heels in love with him and I thought that maybe, just maybe this would be the time he would take me back. Then he broke my soul. He took something from me that can never truly be restored. The absolute worst night of my life happened at the age of 15 when he was 23. My screams for help and my sobs of pain went unheard that night. It is a night I don\u2019t talk about, nor will I divulge the details of that night to you. What I will tell you is that my spark went out that night. Only now, almost 15 years later, have I started to get some of my spark back with the love of a man who deserves it.  And one who is just as odd as I am. Lolita was a tough read for me. I read the book with myself in mind. What a difficult process that was. But it was also cathartic. (Thanks for giving me that word, Dan!). I found a tiny bit of solace in this book. While Lolita may have thought she knew what she was doing and getting herself into I think it is safe to say she had no understanding of the impact her actions would have. I think she sought the love and affection of a father without realizing that sex is not how you love- nor how you receive it. At first, it may have been a bit of a game for her; a conquest of sorts. And Humbert, vile bastard that he was, did love her. His views and expectations of love and what it means were completely skewed. He manipulated every situation to his benefit, ignored her tears, and defiled her at every turn.This book, subject matter aside, is completely brilliant. It gives us a view into the mind of a disturbed man. One day, I would like to write Lolita\u2019s tale and offer her a voice that understands who she is and what she endured.It took a lot of strength and courage to put myself out here as much as I have. I\u2019d like to thank you all in advance for taking the time to read a small but important chapter in my life. It\u2019s all a step in the long process of healing."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Now, this is going to be embarrassing to admit.As we all should know, reading and enjoying a book is largely about interpretation. People are not the same and we all view things differently, one individual might see a relationship in a book as \"passionate\" while another could see it as \"damaging\". When characters make bad decisions, some will view it as stupidity and others will view it as an accurate representation of humanity's imperfections. Not only that, but time often changes the way one person sees things. A teenager does not usually have the same outlook on life and relationships that someone of thirty does, and neither of them have the same outlook as someone of seventy does.So it's time that I admit, when reading this at thirteen, my younger brain actually romanticised Humbert's depravity and saw the relationship between him and Lolita as some tragic love affair that could never work out for the obvious reasons. It was (surprise, surprise) Tatiana's review that made me wonder if I'd had a screw loose when reading this years ago, her interpretation was so far from what I remembered that I simply had to find time for a re-read. This summer, I did just that. I am going to point my shameful finger of blame at my age when I first read it, I was as fooled by Humbert as the young Lolita was.Humbert is not a reliable narrator, his declaration that Lolita was responsible for seducing him is repulsive and wrong. Because, in the end, an adult has no excuse for having sex with a child, even if they're walking around half-naked and offering it up - adults have a responsibility not to take advantage of children, and I now realise how this case is no exception. This is not some tragic romantic tale about forbidden love, it is the story of how a grown man repeatedly raped a young girl. The fact that it is so easy to be taken in by him either says something about how brilliant a writer Nabokov is (which he is), or how much society still loves to blame the victim.I don't know whether to feel better about my original feelings or be horrified that even the description for the audiobook describes the novel as: \"a love story almost shocking in its beauty and tenderness.\" And I also know that I have no right to criticise other people who saw it in such a way, but I would ask you to read it again, to look beyond Humbert's snivelling and self-pity, to see the man who considers murdering a woman so he can be free to have sex with her twelve year old daughter, the man who feels sorry for himself when a young girl doesn't want to have sex with him because she's still hurt from the last time. Is that love? Maybe it was for a thirteen year old looking through Humbert's perverted eyes, but I'm glad I understand it better now.Nabokov has written a brilliant and disturbing novel, my opinion of it hasn't changed in that respect. I found it surprisingly easy to read and became absorbed quickly - even all those years ago. His portrayal of Humbert's perverted mind is scarily good, perhaps even too good if people can so easily be convinced to side with a paedophile - which is often regarded as the ultimate crime of all, isn't it? Even cold-blooded murderers go after prisoners who've messed with kids. And, as much as I feel ashamed for being so taken in by Humbert, I know that it's not just me who was fooled. Hell, even the GR description proves it. But, believe me, Lolita is a victim and no amount of saddening flashbacks to Humbert's past can change that.

That is, until I started pocking around and reading what others have to say about it. Many reactions to this book are puzzling to me. In this world of Jerry Sanduskys and such, there are still people who find this \"erotic,\" who in the end feel compassionate towards the narrator, who think that Lolita was the one who seduced and manipulated poor Humbert? Well, I beg to differ. Lolita is as erotic as Speak is pornographic. As for favorable opinions of Humbert, I guess it is possible this effect can be attributed to Nabokov's mastery of deception. Clearly, Humbert still, half a century after the novel's publication, manages to fool readers, and himself, into believing that he is a dedicated, caring lover, wounded and changed by an early tragic romance. Only occasionally does the truth bleed through his self-delusion - Lolita's wistful glance at a child sitting on his father's lap, a simple act that is forever sallied by Humbert's filth, her disinterest in life, her resignation to satisfy him for pocket money and permission to participate in a school play. No, Humbert did not fool me into feeling sorry for him. On a technical level, Lolita deserves full 5 stars - the language, the wit, the world play! - I don't think I've ever read anything like this before. But emotionally this look into a pedophile's psyche is so disgusting, I can't quite bring myself to rate it so. Humbert is so sickly real to me, with his apologies, justifications of his behavior, cowardice, sob stories and bending of reality, how does an author create someone like this? How did Nabokov get such an intimate knowledge of someone so despicable?"}, {"userName": "Rolls", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18657-rolls", "userReview": "An old friend used to say that \"Ulysses\" was a good book to read but not a good book to \"read\". After reading \"Lolita\" I understand what he meant.Nabokov was a man obsessed with word games and this book is crammed cover to cover with many brilliant examples. Language delighted the man and that certainly comes across. What makes this acheivement even more amazing was that English was his third or fourth language. It is mind blowing that he or anyone could write so fluidly in a \"foreign\" tongue. If this was enough to make a novel great then this would be one of my top ten.But what if, as a reader, you demand that an author make his characters compelling and the narrative involving? I would say then that this book is not for you. Humbert and Dolores Haze (Lolita) only ever (to my mind) become three dimensional at odd moments here and there. He comes off as a mincing, foppish but ultimately unbelievable sort. I never bought into him until very near the end when for a few sentences Nabokov makes his remorse credible. But it is too late for that. I was already annoyed as hell by his rococo narration. The character of Lolita as well is shrill and one note through out. Only intermittently does she come across as worthy of compassion. As for the story, once the seduction takes place it loses a lot of its forward momentum. It begins to feel repetitive and only comes alive again when Humbert reaches the very end of his self control and attempts to lash out at one he believes wronged him. All in all I think this is a book that could stand to lose about fifty pages. There is much to love about it though. It could have been truly replusive. Nabokov knew that his concept was already off putting and that the execution need not be so. Rather than serving up spewing fluids and hungry orifices he treats us to healthy doses of wit and charm. Bravo!\"Lolita\" is obviously literature with a capital \"L.\" It is a work by a man of letters who happened to be a genius - for that reason alone it deserves reading. Just don't be surprised that once you're done you don't feel like recommending it to anyone."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason", "userReview": "Nymph. Nymphet. Nymphetiquette. Nymphology. Nymphism. I will never think of 12 year old girls the same way. There\u2019s a stain on my brain. The power of this book is that it\u2019s creepy and taboo, but the pedophilia and incest is so damn plausible. There\u2019s a criminal, upsetting proclivity of the subject matter, but the whole thing is oiled with reason--SAY IT AINT SO. It\u2019s deviant, queer, puerile, and yet ever so human, darkly human, perverted in the corner.Lolita lingers in my mind, like an accidental glance at the mid-day sun. I believe this book will have a permanent effect on me. I\u2019m thankful, but cautious. It\u2019s a book that I experienced, not so much as read. There are 2 components to this book that radically affected me, the writing and the subject matter.The WritingI have never read another book written quite like Lolita. The writing has depth, layer upon layer, strata against strata, texture among texture. It\u2019s a palimpsest of clues and anagrams and reference. The author has absolute command of the English and French and Latin language. And yet, among the $4 dollar words and bourgeoisie lit crit, Nabakov plays with the language. He invents words. He hyphenates them. He nymphorizes them. It\u2019s a gamboling and frolicking story in the rarefied air of an unrestrained, unapologetic and unadulterated polyhistoric writer. It\u2019s subtle and raw at the same time; it\u2019s pure. Pure, like what happens in your neighborhood behind closed doors, just before an arrest. He incorporates a dry, brittle sense of humor--even a bit of sass. He taunts the reader to follow. He dares the reader to like and enjoy Humbert Humbert. He pokes you in the eye. He scandalizes you, but with a pen that is at once brutal and sensitive, but always careful. There are echoes of Joyce and Poe.The story is a retrospective from...from...from where? What? Prison. Ostensibly. And yet, there hasn\u2019t been a trial yet--no judgement. Nabakov tantalizes you, \u201cladies and gentlemen of the jury,\u201d to pass judgement on Humbert Humbert yourself. Are you willing? Or will you just turn your head, wincing?The writing is breathless, eloquent, exacting, alluring, inventive, sexy, pleading, conceited, lurid, savory, languid, and slyly self-deprecating. The author is flagrant, unapologetic, a dandy even. He whiffles the writing in so many little stylistic flourishes. He writes sentences and paragraphs in ways that I would never have guessed to try. It\u2019s insanely periodic writing; I grab my head akimbo in pure awe of the sentences. I peeked at an annotated version for 20 pages at a local big-box book store. Wow, there\u2019s so many levels to this writing, of so much I was ignorant. Did you know that under the shocking story of pedophilia, Nabakov is carrying on a paper chase with clues on almost every page? Yes, there\u2019s a whole other plane of conversation hidden below the written words--grammatically, semantically, nymphatically. They\u2019re buried in the french words, the double entendres, the onomatopoeia, the puns, the metonymy, the symbols, the rhyming, the nymphventions. Palimpsest \u201cladies and gentlemen.\u201dThe Subject MatterWe all know Lolita is supposed to be shocking, revolting even, many people not able to finish it. Titillating, serious fiction about pedophilia is the clear edge of the literary envelope, something banned in many different communities, even today. At this particular time in our democracy, as one of the freest countries in the world, and the most progressive, we champion human rights and place a huge penalty on crimes against minors. In this spirit, we are supposed to decry and detest the subject matter in this book, and lambast the author. People are arrested and put on community rosters for crimes against minors. This 300+ page book chronicles a crime against a minor. Nabakov makes this an even more difficult sexual arrangement for his readers to contemplate, because the 12 year old is an eager, compliant and willing partner to the crime.In Lolita the protagonist is a criminal and his actions unforgivable. BUT, if there was any method to his madness, it would have to be this:Humans share a cephalization process in common with most vertebrates. We developed cerebral hemispheres several million years ago (progressing beyond our closest ancestors), and more recently than that, humans learned how to use the cerebral cortex to reason, judge, cognate, and intuit. But, hundreds of millions of years ago, way down the taxonomic branch, we shared with other vertebrates a common mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, the midbrain and hindbrain. Tucked up under our marvelous, modern cortex, the midbrain and hindbrain, called the brain stem, are comprised of the pons, cerebellum, and yes, the MEDULLA OBLONGATA! These are ancient, compact organs. They are the most \u2018animal\u2019 part of our brains. They are in control of the lower order mental functions, the basic mechanistic functions upon which everything else depends. You can lose part of your cortex and still function as a human. You cannot, however, lose any of your brain stem without losing basic animal function. The brain stem is innately integral to life.It\u2019s from this midbrain we get reflex, instinct, coordinated movement, sex drive, fight-or-flight, and a whole range of metabolic regulation for all organs in the rest of the body. The impulses (the input, the direction, the priority) originating in these Mesozoic Era brain organs are powerful. The cerebral cortex would be remiss to block an impulse from this deep, ancient brain--even if it could stop the impulse in time. It\u2019s difficult for our human cortex to constrain an electrical input from the animal brain stem. What comes from the stem is automatically life-sustaining, life-preserving, and high priority. The cortex usually plays catch-up to brain stem messaging.But humans do it all the time. It\u2019s called reason, judgement, cognition, and conscience. It\u2019s called being civilized. It\u2019s keeping in check our vertebrate impulses.Enter Humbert Humbert. He suffers an atavistic urge to procreate with young nymphets. This is a social problem driven and turbocharged by the midbrain. He understands (his cortex understands) that the culture of the late 1940s and early 1950s find this taboo and perverse, definitely criminal. But our poor Humberto doesn\u2019t care. He reasons with his midbrain, and pleads to us, \"the jury.\" In the not too distant past within our own Western culture, and certainly in modern cultures of tribal peoples, 12 year old girls are ready to mate. Lolita has already menstruated and had sex with a boy her age. In many cultures of the world, Lolita would be given up as a wife in exchange for dowries of cattle, land, political favor. The whole story, then, brings this American taboo to a moral question. And its a question that you--modern citizen--find uncomfortable, like I do.Even more disturbing, Nabakov makes Humby Humberty a caring, loving, protective paternal figure that wishes Lolita the best in life. There is no direct, lewd reference to the act of sex; nothing salacious; nothing pornographic. No, that would be too easy to damn Humbo to the devil. Instead, Nabakov explores the possibility that real love may exist betwain the tween.I\u2019m not too happy to report a phenomenon that happens to men of sexual capacity, always and forever. It\u2019s an impulse from the midbrain, and it pushes through all that civilization-ing. It\u2019s happened to all men (I know because it\u2019s been a topic of conversation in many different social settings to which I was eye-witness). Take for example a young woman of 16 or 17 years. From afar I see a body in bikini, I see a tight, athletic form, I see a bronzed body wearing clothes much too revealing, and immediately the midbrain excites the male sex drive. Upon closer approach, I\u2019m horrified to see that this nubile figure is much too young for me. Am I perverted? Criminal thoughts? I don\u2019t think so. The midbrain wants to ensure successful mating, and for hundreds of millions of years, sexual mating, to be maximally effective, and to outlast environmental exigencies, was driven down to the earliest age that could conceive offspring. So that dastardly urge men experience around cheerleaders, or girls at the beach that look as healthy and trim as fresh gazelles--it\u2019s not right dammit, and most of us keep it in check, but there it is and it\u2019s nagging, and I wish it away. But no, I think it will remain and haunt me at times like it haunts all men--your men--your brothers and your fathers and your lovers. I look away in disgust of myself, call myself a \u2018dirty old man,\u2019 whatever it takes to recalibrate my thoughts. It happens occasionally--that oogling--but I keep it in check. But if you think society has civilized itself away from this midbrain urge, type into google the words: \u201clist of sexual predators in my area.\u201d You will see a Mesozoic characteristic come alive. {note to self, this paragraph may need to be reworded...a very good chance most people will misconstrue it...as if I was pardoning the midbrain urge...or worse, that I pardon Humbert Humbert...not the case at all}So that\u2019s why at the beginning I said this story was so damn plausible and upsetting and \u2018oiled with reason,\u2019 and darkly human. Pedophilia and incest has occurred, is occurring, and will always occur.

For many years I kept hearing about this book, the content sounding disturbing and perhaps even slightly fascinating. It\u2019s a book that\u2019s central theme is one of the darkest elements of mankind: paedophilia. And although such a thing is beyond revolting, it is used to tell the tale of a very lost and very lonely man. Humbert is a man to be pitted, pitted because he actually exists. A child in a man\u2019s body, unable to move on from what was to him the most perfect memory; Humbert\u2019s obsession with youth takes on the form of paedophilia: he becomes attracted to this idea of purity and develops strong sexual feelings towards it. Humbert knows he is a monster, but he just doesn\u2019t care. To him his feelings are perfectly justifiable, natural even. He has an incredibly distorted view of the world; thus, we see the world through the eyes of an extremely unreliable narrator. Perhaps unreliable is the wrong word. He reports what he sees with utmost honesty; however, his perceptions of these experiences are, well, just wrong. As a character study, he is a very worthy subject. In the wake of Freudian psychoanalysis, Nabokov\u2019s novel is aware of the rising field of psychology. Humbert is a walking contradiction. He is at times unbelievably arrogant, and at other times he is timid and weak; he is passive yet manipulative; he derides nothing from life other than a person sense of sexual gratification: it\u2019s all he lives for. He has an exceedingly narrow range of interests; he scrutinises everything and remembers the most minor of details. He is charming, but at other times completely socially awkward. I think it wouldn\u2019t be too far a thing to suggest that there are elements of Autism within his personality. He is obsessive about things, about his work and \u201chis\u201d Lolita. Ironically, at one point, he expresses succinct knowledge of Freud and at another he demonstrates complete ignorance towards Freud\u2019s psychosexual stages of development. So who exactly is this Humbert?Humbert is lost; he is lost in life, and he is lost within himself: he is hopeless, looking for any sense of light in his life. Unfortunately, this projection of desperation takes on the form of a child. He falls in love with Lolita, and what she represents to him. But of course it\u2019s not real love; Lolita is just a sexual object to him not a person. So what follows is a story of a man who has convinced himself that his actions are perfectly justified. When he takes a twelve year old child in his arms; it is perfectly fine to his mind because she comes willing. Never mind the fact that he has crafted a situation so that she responds to his advances. She is vulnerable and completely alone in the world; she has no one to turn to in her moment of grief, and the snake is ready to lunge.Nabokov describes some truly disturbing scenes, though he does so with eloquence bordering on the genius. Sounds odd, considering what I have just described. The content of the book is vile, Humbert is vile, but in a fictionalised world we have to look beyond that. The world is seen through the eyes of Humbert, so everything we see is what he sees and what he experiences. Nabokov uses free-indirect style to narrate some harrowing scenes, the content is vile but the language is beautiful. Again, this is what Humbert experiences. As troubling as this book may be, I argue that this has very strong place in the literary world. Nabokov explores the mind of a sexual predator and I think as readers we can learn a great deal in the process. We can see how the psychological make up of such an individual is formed and we can see what they think and they feel. To understand such a man is the first step towards stopping him and recognising this behaviour in other men. As a reviewer, I find it of vital importance to read the reviews of others. There\u2019s a quote on the back of my book from one such review; it says, and I quote \u201cThere\u2019s no funnier monster in modern literature than poor, doomed Humbert Humbert.\u201d I cannot quite describe how angry that quote makes me. There is nothing funny about Lolita.This book is terribly serious in content, and Humbert is not a man to be laughed at. What we have is a deeply disturbed individual, one confused and drifting through life, cold and utterly broken inside, and he is about to ruin the life of a young girl. I don\u2019t laugh at this book, I weep at its brilliance."}, {"userName": "Huda Yahya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7878381-huda-yahya",

been accused of statutory rape and sexual exploitation of a minor. I did it because it is my job and I fundamentally believe that everyone, no matter how heinous the crime alleged, deserves a fair trial.That said, it was the single most unpleasant experience of my legal career and high in the running for most unpleasant all time.In popular culture we are inundated with scenes of crime and violence, we live in a morally relative landscape where \u201cto each his own\u201d is taken to Bohemian extremes.But sexual attention towards children, in any context, is universally reviled and vilified.Lo. Lee. Ta.Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s 1955 novel is masterful prose. Like Joseph Conrad before him, it is understatement to say that his virtuosity in English (not his first language) literature is impressive.Yes, it is about a pervert, a sex offender, a child rapist. A brute. A monster.Humbert Humbert names himself such. Whether sympathetic chronicler or unreliable narrator I will leave for each reader\u2019s interpretation, but either way Nabokov has demonstrated his consummate skill with a character as enigmatic and iconoclastically established in modern literature as to be a shadowy lurker in the black alleys of our most maligned society.Nabokov\u2019s narration, told from the prison diary of HH, is erudite, witty and humorous. The author\u2019s stylish ability is incomparable. In spite of the subject matter I had to laugh many times at the way he crafted his narrative, especially his droll word play and numerous double entendres.This is presented as a first person letter, recommended by his lawyer, of his unfortunate attraction to \u201cnymphets\u201d (a girl child between the ages of 9 and 14) and to his particular seduction of his erstwhile step-daughter Dolores, whom he affectionately calls Lolita. Several times throughout the chronicle the tragi-comic protagonist entreats the attention of the \u201cgentlemen of the jury\u201d. He describes his yearlong affair with the child in words that are at times repentant and remorseful, and at other times attempting a justification and explanation of his acts.Humburt, a European \u00e9migr\u00e9 to our shores, also fills his account, \u201cjoyriding\u201d as they do across America, with an ongoing ironic observation of our culture. Nabakov could use this all as an extended allegory for old world attraction with our new world mores and customs. Lolita, then, would be the central focus of this fascination and a living metaphor for America, at once childlike and alluring.Brilliantly written with a shamefully outrageous subject, once the reader recovers from the shock quotient (if the reader recovers) this is a wealth of literary genius and style."}, {"userName": "Namrirru", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188169-namrirru", "userReview": "Nabokov often writes his novels in the perspective of detestable villains. You never like them, you're never supposed to like them, and Nabokov doesn't like them either. He slaps them around and humiliates them. And in the end, they pay the price for their sins. Readers never seem to realize this. They become immersed in the psychology of the book and feel defiled by it all. Instead, they should sit back and watch the bastards suffer. The stories are written in their own view so that makes the punishment all the more sweet. The reader knows exactly what the scheisemeister is feeling - pain, pain, pain. That's one of the reasons I like Nabokov so much. The bad guys really get it. It's not just getting killed or caught at the end, you really feel their anguish. Mmm... schadenfreude.\" I sort of believe the reason why most of the characters are 2 dimensional is precisely because of who is potraying them, a depraved person. A depraved person who commits terrible, unforgivable crimes against people. How could he commit those crimes if he saw them as the human beings that they are? It's easier for a crook to swindle if he dehumanizes his victims. At the end of Lolita, Lolita transfigures. She's a sensitive, care-worn woman, but only because HH realizes her as such. That's why he can murder the man who betrayed her at the end. He was a filthy mongrel that deserved to die for what he did to her. \"She groped for words. I supplied them mentally (\"He broke my heart. You merely broke my life\").\" I don't remember, but this could be the first time he \"supplied [words] mentally\" in a way that's true and unselfish. He finally understood her as a person and sacrificed himself to revenge her. Perhaps, HH's only redeeming quality. In Nabokov's books where the villain is the protagonist, the only other charachter with real depth or psychology is a character who the protagonists loves. The little daughter in Laughter in the Dark, Lolita at the end the novel, Despair? The protagonist in that one is a sociopath and doesn't give his novel-mates anything, but their personalities pop out. You can feel them from the distance. Other novels I've read by him don't exactly fit this mold. In Pnin, everyone is a little characterized but still quite real, Pale Fire is written by an almost-villain and you love everyone but him, especially the wife of the poet, Invitation to a Beheading, not even the main protagonist was very real. He had the same consciousness and feelings that a \"K\" would have in one of Kafka's novels. But he had no believable history, it's all just a dreamscape that doesn't have half the terror as Kafka's novels have. I never finished Ada or Ador. It's Lolita x 10 in smuttiness. \"Is this really necessary??\" And it wasn't believable either. Just a fantasy. Of course, not all his novels are going to follow the same formula, but they are written by the same writer, the same mind. So I'm still working on him. I really think he's one of the best writers of the 20th century. He doesn't just tell a story, he explores the psyche and human perceptions, how a certain person feels, sees, or reacts to things. If they were normal people, it wouldn't be interesting, but he picks villains or eccentrics."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733629-chris", "userReview": "*Ranked as one of the Top 100 Fiction of the 20th Century*I\u2019m not quite sure how to put this in words. Hell, I\u2019m not sure what I intend to say, so this is going to be ugly. If you want to sit in on this exercise be my guest, you\u2019ve probably got more important things to do, such as organizing your cassette tapes and LPs before shoving them in a box destined for the attic, believe me, your time will be better spent, especially when you take that stroll down memory lane and consider how killer it would be to rock out to Depeche Mode and A-Ha all afternoon (it\u2019s possible you\u2019re one of those badasses with some Dead Kennedys on cassette, more power to you, feel free to tear off your shirt and bathe with a 40oz of Big Bear). You might want to clean your bong while you\u2019re at it; you never know how immersed you\u2019ll get in the hazy recollections of your exploits during the New Wave or burgeoning Hardcore era and might prefer a soundtrack to complement your deranged thoughts.\tAs for Lolita, maybe this tangential bullshit will help get my point across\u2026 I\u2019ve recently taken a keen interest in watching \u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d, but as soon as the show concludes I wonder \u201cWhat have I walked away with, after investing 50 minutes and 4 rum & cokes to the accompaniment of these awe-inspiring images of man battling the elements to strike bepincered gold?\u201d Not much, appears to be the answer; it\u2019s just a bunch of crabs, crabs, crabs, and master-baiting, the simple ingredients of all my friendships and relationships. Sure, it\u2019s awesome to watch sea-faring maniacs risk life and limb to haul in the nasty creatures that pay their bills, but there\u2019s nothing else to it, just dudes getting stoked over a huge haul of crabs, or lamenting some element of the life they\u2019ve chosen. Then you get to thinking how these dudes\u2019 wives manage without them at sea for 20+ days at a time; obviously they are in the crab-catching business as well. And the real kick in the ass is that I don\u2019t even eat crab, hell, I\u2019ve never even tried a dish that incorporates any crab. When I consider the ridiculousness of it all, it seems pretty disheartening. This sort of pointless introspection is probably how Des Esseintes got his start, so I\u2019ll leave it at that before it becomes habit-forming.\tI can\u2019t say that my opinion of Lolita is much different. It\u2019s just Humbert Humbert endlessly rhapsodizing about nymphettes, most substantially, his nymphette, Lolita. And that\u2019s it; I\u2019ve probably never read anything so one-dimensional in my life. I\u2019m sure the upper echelons of literary critics found myriad reasons beyond my primitive sensibilities for including this in the Top 100 works of 20th century fiction, I just don\u2019t happen to see it. One of these qualifiers might be this absurd statement on the back cover, \u2018Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America\u2019. Now, when we consider the social climate at the time of publication, with book-banning and obscenity trials recently being all the rage, and you know that in order to somehow foist upon the public a tale concerning a grown man\u2019s obsession and fornication with a 12 year old girl the defenders of this thinly-veiled smut have to somehow show that there is something above and beyond mere prurient interest hidden between the covers of the book, so statements like the one above are thrown out there to mind-f#ck all. I don\u2019t even know what the hell that statement on the cover is supposed to mean, but \u2018postwar America\u2019 were powerful buzzwords at the time, and truly, what else could you possibly use as a thematic defense for this book, seeing as the book has nothing to offer except the ridiculous tale of a weathered old pervert ogling young girls on the hopscotch courts, finding one that epitomizes his unacceptable desires, and eventually having his way with her before attempting to completely control her young body and mind during a trek that can only be considered kidnapping on the grandest scale. Let\u2019s not forget that when his precious nymphette is purloined by an unknown fiend, he goes off to ambush the guy and shoot his ass; this is not the behavior of the \u2018hypercivilized\u2019; my own rather sloppy upbringing declares that anyone with a shred of civility offers his adversary a duel rather than attack him unawares, Humbert is a lowly coward of the worst disposition. The \u2018hypercivilized\u2019 don\u2019t go around bagging 85 pound kids sporting skinned knees from spills at the roller-rink, real men fish for those awesome and voluptuous Amazonians, the women who proudly stand 5\u201910\u201d or more and have generous curves that modern fabrics fruitlessly struggle to contain from spilling forth in all their fully-developed glory. Our man Humbert has no such redeeming qualities; he\u2019s a scoundrel of the lowest and basest rank. Let\u2019s not forget that he weeps, and when I conjure a mental image of the elusive \u2018hypercivilized European\u2019, weeping like a bitch and throwing a tantrum doesn\u2019t enter the picture.\tWhile the frauds who compiled the Top 100 Fiction list and I might diverge in our estimations of Lolita, I will agree with our man John Updike when he states \u201cNabokov writes prose the only way it should be written, that is, ecstatically.\u201d There is no denying that the book is phenomenally written, but the repetition of nymphette-this and nymphette-that simply overwhelmed me; I was left with an indelible image of Nabokov sitting there alternately referencing his thesaurus and a collection of kiddie porn for inspiration while hammering this out. I\u2019d have enjoyed this book a thousand times more had it been about turtles, or walnuts, or my mother's first communion, hell, anything else. Nymphettes suck: there is a reason I don\u2019t go trolling for trim at the nearest bus station, who the hell wants to put up with the behavior of a pubescent trollop? \tThere isn\u2019t a whole hell of a lot that I know, but I do know this; if my choices were either read Lolita again or spend a day crabbing in the arctic, I\u2019d better be prepared to get some frostbite on my beanbag."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Other formerly shocking novels of previous centuries have lost their power, batteries quite flat (Madame Bovary, Ulysses, Lady Chatterly\u2019s Lover) \u2013 we love them still but we wince no more, we may be quite amused at the idea that this word or that idea was not allowed in polite society \u2013 we may, indeed, be vastly amused at the very idea of polite society because society is just not very polite at all these days. But uniquely, Lolita, this great and appalling novel, only gets more shocking and more dangerous as the years go by, as more and more paedophilia is uncovered every other day in the news, in nurseries, in hard drives, in the highest of churches, as the paranoia spreads. I found myself quite nervous about even being seen reading Lolita at work. And very glad the cover was an awful grey with a hideous attempt at a butterfly in the corner, and not the suggestive white-socks-and-short-school-skirt of some editions.Lolita is the blackest of all comedies, the blackness of a deep mine of human corruption with all the canaries long dead in the poisonous atmosphere. It\u2019s a comedy about depravity. You want to know what depravity is? These days, that\u2019s a quaint word. Reminds me of that risible phrase of the censors \u201ca tendency to deprave and corrupt\u201d. Here is depravity :This was an orphan. This was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a heavy limbed, foul-smelling adult had had strenuous intercourse three times that very morning. (p140)When, during our longer stops, I would relax after a particularly violent morning in bed, and out of the goodness of my lulled heart allow her \u2013 indulgent Hum! \u2013 to visit the rose garden or the children\u2019s library\u2026 (p160)Thrusting my fatherly fingers deep into Lo\u2019s hair from behind, and then gently clasping them around the nape of her neck, I would lead my reluctant pet to our small home for a quick connection before dinner. (p164)\u2026 and her sobs in the night \u2013 every night, every night \u2013 the moment I feigned sleep. (p176)Depraved is when you don\u2019t wish to acknowledge the pain you\u2019re doling out as you feast and guzzle, or, yes, you do acknowledge it, with a sad shrug, oh la, alas, it is sad but that is how it is, or perhaps it\u2019s when these tears, this misery, makes your pleasure even more piquant and delectable. I think Humbert bounces gently between the three. Yes, poor little Lo. As he says himself:I entered a plane of being where nothing mattered, save the infusion of joy brewed within my body. As you read Lolita the uncomfortable feeling steals over you that whilst VN had no direct knowledge of his grisly subject, nevertheless he\u2019d thought about it a bit too much. In HH\u2019s mind, and we are never out of it, we go fumbling, frolicking, frottaging and frothing in paroxysms of nympholepsy, we hang over his shoulder the whole time, we\u2019re with him during every bated glimpse of little Lo\u2019s long languid limbs, drooling, always drooling, and of course, we're with him from first spurt to last. VN didn\u2019t have to write about a highly intelligent, highly cultured paedophile. That was his big fat choice. WHY PAEDOPHILIA?I stumbled upon this quote from the wonderfully named Leland de la Durantaye in the Village Voice:To search for the experiences leading to a work of art is as natural as not finding them.I\u2019m not altogether sure what VN was up to. Yes, Lolita is a case study, but VN hated Freud and psychoanalysis. Yes, it\u2019s a criminal confession, but VN was a writer obsessed with self-reflecting introverted solipsistic linguistic game-playing, those are the novels he wrote, from Ada to Pnin to Pale Fire \u2013 parodies all, and he really wasn\u2019t much interested in realism. If you were picking your team of realistic novelists, Vlad the Impaler wouldn\u2019t even be a substitute. So it\u2019s ironic that his one and only famous \u2013 I mean, really famous \u2013 novel is about a giant social problem which is always as fresh as today\u2019s headlines, and never gets old, just like those nymphets.LOVE IS THE SWEETEST THINGPerhaps Lolita is VN\u2019s meditation on love. Because Humbert loves little Lo. He tells us so in such gorgeous sentences that you would have to have a heart of stone not to believe him. That must be it.This nymphet thing, it\u2019s an idea, an erotic ideal, not a person. VN\u2019s Humbert is constantly in search of a human being who most closely embodies this ideal. He\u2019s actually not interested in little girls at all, finds them unpleasant \u2013 except insofar at they personify the nymphet idea. At that point he turns into a sick junkie whose connection has just arrived. But the girl will only be desirable for two, maybe three years. As soon as the girl in question grows up & passes into adolescence the poor paedophile turns away in disgust. And of course there can be very little connection between the two interested parties except on the level of carnality because one of the parties is a middle-aged male and the other is a 12 year old child. Humbert\u2019s obsession condemns both of them to profound loneliness, as well as morbid co-dependency \u2013 he can\u2019t allow either of them to have any normal friendships. This whole hideous situation is laid out for our bug-eyed perusal \u2013 the fulfillment which can only ever be coercive, the love which can only ever be rape, the relationship which can only ever be damaging. Humbert loves his little Lo. We know because he tells us so.Don\u2019t think I can go on. Heart, head \u2013 everything. Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, . Repeat till the page is full, printer. (p109)And I looked and looked at her and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else. (p277)Even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish, and her nipples swell and crack, and her lovely young velvety delta be tainted and torn \u2013 even then would I go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face, at the mere sound of your raccous young voice, my Lolita. (p278)In 1963 Phil Spector put out a single by The Crystals written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King called \u201cHe Hit Me (And it Felt Like a Kiss)\u201d \u2013 it took them a week or so to realize that their audience found the song repulsive and it was withdrawn. But that idea of what love is can be found in every other courtroom. I found her in bed with another man so naturally I shot her. I loved her so much but she told me she was leaving so of course I killed her. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her leaving. She died because I loved her. I loved her to death. Day in, day out, this is the love in many men\u2019s minds. This is the cold polar opposite of If You Love Somebody Set Them Free. That happy sentiment is thought to be Not Love At All by many people. Possession is nine tenths of the conjugal domain. HH owns Lolita, she can\u2019t go anywhere. He glories in how much his she is. Oh Lolita, you are my girl, as Vee was Poe\u2019s and Bea Dante\u2019s, and what little girl would not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties?  (p107)Maybe that nasty Nabokov is suggesting that the nature of love is that love does not care about the loved one, not really, it says it does, but when you look at the thing closely, it doesn\u2019t. The weddings, the honeymoons, the diamonds, the sweet words, all of it, maybe that\u2019s just for your benefit, all bribes. Could even Vlad be that cynical? Maybe.HUMBERT HUMBERT WAS GAYI think this theory is reductive, demeaning and wrong. But he was very camp.THOUSANDS OF LOLITASChildhood for girls didn\u2019t used to be as protected as it is now in the west, and it still isn\u2019t, of course, for many girls in many countries in 2011. Humbert\u2019s crimes against Lolita would not be seen as crimes at all in many places. There are plenty of tour guides who will assist you if you want to be Humbert for a week or two in Vietman or Cambodia. There\u2019s thousands of Lolitas out there if that\u2019s your cup of tea. In the West the Victorians invented childhood* and their earnest reformers tried and eventually succeeded in sweeping away the crowds of child prostitutes which thronged Hyde Park and the other thoroughfares of London as they did in the time of Samuel Johnson. Liberal Western culture has re-engineered the whole notion of childhood but it\u2019s perpetually under attackFrom the Lancashire telegraph\u2018Don\u2019t take away their childhood\u2019 say East Lancashire mums2:40pm Wednesday 22nd June 2011PUSH up bras for nine-year-olds, \u2018WAG\u2019 slogan T-shirts for pre-schoolers and high heeled shoes for toddlers. These might sound like ludicrous concepts, but over the past year a string of high street retailers have been criticised for selling such items.VERY ODDLolita is a strange book. After grinding away in the literary undergrowth for decades, catching butterflies and dodging Nazis, VN spent 5 years writing it and a couple more years finding a publisher, and then WHAM! Number one best-seller. Fame, notoriety, and heaps of crisp dollar notes came raining down. He quit his job and left America, lived a swish life in Switzerland. He was in his late 50s and he\u2019s written a novel everyone wanted to read and \u2013 I am going to guess \u2013 few people actually finished. Lolita displaced Anatomy of a Murder as the No 1 bestseller, and was replaced in turn by Doctor Zhivago. Those first eager purchasers, they were looking for a shocking frolick, and they got a second James Joyce, brilliant, wild, too clever by half, terrifying, witty, revolting and, of course, ferociously cultivated. Was that what they wanted?You read novels and you think well, this was good, but that plot there or this conclusion or that style could have been improved, you know, so, only 3.5 stars. But Lolita is a novel which writes its own rules, a mesmerising mashup of horror, beauty, wildness, syntactical dexterity and adventures in extreme obsession and extreme vocabulary, a novel that I am amazed exists at all. *http://engl212fc.wordpress.com/2010/1..."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "Astoundingly beautiful prose, a self-aware psychotic narrator who is both unapologetic and yet disgusted by his crime...so many themes in this book, so much symmetry (342). Humbert Humbert knows he is both brilliant and insanely obsessed with pre-pubescent girls. He tortures his psychiatrists \"cunningly leading them on; never letting them see [he] knew every trick of the trade\" (P. 34). He becomes a lodger with Ms. Haze, a widow, and sees his nymphet in her yard, \"a blue sea-wave swelled under [his] heart and, from a mat in a pool of sun, half-naked, kneeling, turning about on her knees, there was my Riviera love peering at me over dark glasses.\" (P. 39) He obsesses over Lo listening - in his fateful diary - to details as minor as \"the staccato sound [a toilet paper roll makes] as it turns.\" (P. 49). The text is both reprehensible and hilarious, the writing always being of a sublimely dreamy quality. Was Roth inspired by this scene when he wrote of Nathan Zuckerman hunting around the room of Amy Bellette in The Ghost Writer?Fate throws HH and his Lo together (no spoilers, I promise). HH holds a reformatory existence over her as ransom for the naughtiness he extracts. There are a few epic road trips:\"As we pushed westward, patches of what the garbage-man called \"sage brush\" appeared, and then the mysterious outlines of table-like hills, and then red bluffs ink-blotted with junipers, and then a mountain range, dun grading into blue, and blue into dream, and the desert would meet us with a steady gale, dust, gray thorn bushes, and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking pale flowers among the prickles of wind-tortured withered stalks all along the highway; in the middle of which there sometimes stood simple cows, immobilized in a position (tail left, eyelashes right) cutting across all human rules of traffic.\" (P. 153)How did Nabokov pull this off? He arrived in the US in 1941 and conceived Lolita during a drive out in the Western US in 1955 (otherwise how could you explain the precision and realism of the above sentence?) This being his third work in a non-native English language (translated by him back to Russian in 1965 - parenthetically are there any russophones reading this post that have read both the English and Russian Lolitas? What is the Russian one like?)I love this description of an otherwise nondescript gas station in the middle of nowhere: \"I stared in such dull discomfort of mind at those stationary trivialities that looked almost surprised, like staring rustics, to find themselves in the stranded traveller's field of vision: that green garbage can, those very black, very whitewalled tires for sale, those bright cans of motor oil, that red icebox with assorted drinks, the four, five, seven discarded bottles within the incomplete crossword puzzle of their wooden cells, that bug patiently walking up the inside of the window of the office.\" (P. 211)I could only dream of aspiring to write descriptions like that, and English is my native language. Pure genius. There is a lot of tennis in the novel, particularly towards the end leading me to wonder if DFW was a huge Nabakov fan (being similarly obsessed with thr sport.) Here is a description of chess that certainly must have given DFW some inspiration:\"I saw the board as a square as of limpid water with rare shells and stratagems rosily visible upon the smooth tessellated bottom, which to my confused adversary was all ooze and squid-cloud.\" (P. 233)There is a wonderful little poem near the end:\"The moral sense in mortals is the dutyWe have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.\" (P. 283)The central problem in the novel is of course HH's seduction of Lo and her sometimes complicity (rebelling against the mother who never loved her). But both he and Lo are aware that he is a sham:\"It had become gradually clear to my conventional Lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitation that even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest, which, in the long run, was the best I could offer the waif.\" (P. 287)Nabokov insisted that there is no moral to this novel - it is neither a condoning or condemnation of incest. That kind of judgmental attitude would clearly have ruined the text. That being said, we clearly see that HH is a hopeless pervert and a predator a father's worst nightmare- and we see how Lo ends up - lost, but defiant to the end. This is a novel of extraordinary power and beauty in which Nabokov challenges us to read beyond our disgust and fear and live uncomfortably in HH's mind for 300 beautifully written pages. Hard forget and impossible to ignore, it is Nabokov's greatest contribution to literature imho."}, {"userName": "Luca Ambrosino", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino", "userReview": "ENGLISH (Lolita) / ITALIANOAfter dusty years in my bookshelf, finally I decided to read \"Lolita\". I am blown away by this Vladimir Nabokov's work, ironic and dramatic at the same time. I am not shocked, nor I have found those disastrous tones of an announced tragedy that I was expecting from this book. Indeed Nabokov tells us that this work:\"... brings along no moral. For me a work of fiction exists only if it gives me what I frankly shall call aesthetic pleasure.\"The main character, Humbert, describes in a precise and often sarcastic way his syndrome, i.e. the uncontrollable attraction towards those he defines \"nymphets\" based on a rigorous combination of age, attitude and style of dress, a lethal mix that can catapult him into an abyss of irrationality. Some \"normal\" dalliances had in adolescence or adulthood are worthless. Something is wrong in our antihero, which plans convenience marriages or improbable assassinations just to satisfy his ecstatic passion. Playing the dual role of fugitive and pursuer in a long road trip, the wretched fate of a grotesque man takes place. A man that until the end is unable to control his insane and delirious love.But still love.Vote: 8Dopo anni di polverosa presenza nel mio scaffale, decido con moderato entusiasmo di leggere questo libro. Ironico e drammatico al contempo, quest'opera di Vladimir Nabokov mi ha spiazzato. Non mi sono scandalizzato, n\u00e9 ho ritrovato quei toni funesti da tragedia annunciata che il titolo \"Lolita\" sempre suscitava in me. D'altronde ci dice Nabokov che la sua opera:\"... non si porta dietro nessuna morale. Per me un'opera di narrativa esiste solo se mi procura quella che chiamer\u00f2 francamente volutt\u00e0 estetica\".Il protagonista, Humbert, descrive in maniera precisa e spesso sarcastica la sua sindrome, l'attrazione irrefrenabile verso coloro che definisce \"ninfette\" sulla base di una rigorosa combinazione di et\u00e0, atteggiamento e modo di vestire, un mix letale in grado di scaraventarlo in un abisso di irrazionalit\u00e0. A nulla valgono esperienze relazionali \"normali\" avute in adolescenza o in et\u00e0 adulta. Qualcosa non quadra nel bell'Humbert, che progetta matrimoni di convenienza o improbabili assassinii pur di soddisfare la sua estatica passione. Rivestendo il duplice ruolo di fuggiasco ed inseguitore in un lungo viaggio on the road, si compie il gramo destino di un uomo grottesco, incapace fino all'ultimo di dominare il suo amore insano e delirante.Ma pur sempre amore.Voto: 8"}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af \u0395\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2   Vernus Portitor Arcanus

interview with Nabokov, where he was asked what long-term effect he thought Lolita had had. I suppose the interviewer was looking for some comment on the liberalization of censorship laws, or something like that. Nabokov didn't want to play - as you can see in Look at the Harlequins, he was pretty tired of these questions. So he said well, as far as he could make out, there had only been one effect. Mothers of young girls named Dolores no longer affectionately called them Lolita. I loved this reply for its magnificent unhelpfulness. In a very narrow sense, Nabokov was surely right. I challenge anyone to prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Lolita has had any effect over and above the one he named. And in principle I also approve of Nabokov's attitude towards critics, and the way he loved teasing them. Pale Fire is another long joke at the critics' expense (how many other books are there where most of the action takes place in the footnotes?), and, like John Shade, he burned his rough drafts to make sure that posterity had as little material as possible to work with. But, if one wants to go against Nabokov's stated wishes and indulge in a small amount of speculation, it does seem to me that Lolita has had a substantial effect in terms of popularizing the narrative technique where a character is initially presented in sympathetic terms, and then gradually revealed as a monster. Two examples that immediately spring to mind are Martin Amis and Ruth Rendell. In Lolita, Nabokov cunningly introduces Humbert as a rather engaging personality, and fabricates all sorts of extenuating circumstances. To start off with, there's the tragic story of his childhood romance with poor Annabel Leigh. Then Lo is far from innocent, and, as Humbert points out, she seduces him. But the fact remains that, whatever excuses you may come up with, it's just wrong for an adult male to have sex with a twelve year old girl. After a while Humbert, and the reader, is forced to admit that he has turned her into a whore who fellates him for small change, and then cries herself to sleep every night. You feel disgusted with yourself for ever being dumb enough to fall for this slick con artist.Hopefully, the controversial opinions I've just expressed won't result in some overzealous Iranian cleric putting a fatwa on me - one of the first things the Ayatollah Khomeini did on gaining power was to lower the age of consent to 9, on the grounds that the Prophet's youngest wife was that age when she married him. You see how dangerous this speculative analysis can be?____________________________________While making dinner (turkey fajitas), I thought about the question Paul raised, whether we can believe what Humbert is telling us. I was wondering what evidence I could present to support my point of view, which is that he only distorts the truth and omits things, rather than simply lying outright.I would say that my basic argument is that Humbert isn't really writing for us, he's writing for himself, so any lies he tells are going to be the kind of lies one tells to oneself, rather than those one tells to other people. It's true that people do sometimes plain flat-out lie to themselves. But Humbert is a smart, educated guy who thinks a lot, and he doesn't seem delusional; I find it plausible that he is more telling the story his way, and working hard to find an interpretation that makes his actions pardonable. But this involves greater and greater distortion of the facts, and in the end there are things he can no longer explain away. It hits so hard because he's previously done a good job of making the reader identify with him; the reader almost feels that he has been lying to himself.I came up with a couple more books to which I'd had similar reactions. One is Agatha Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, where it turns out that the murderer is the person narrating the story. I remember a friend saying that nothing had ever creeped him out quite as badly: he felt for a second that he, himself, was the murderer! Less obviously, there's Sartre's L'\u00e2ge de raison. Mathieu doesn't seem like such a bad guy, even though he's a bit of a dope, and nothing he does really comes across as particularly evil. Yet, somewhere near the end, you're forced to admit that he is in fact a person who will steal a substantial amount of money from a friend in order to pay for his mistress's abortion. You wonder why you previously felt sympathetic.A final thought I had while preparing dinner. One of the very scariest things about Lolita is that Humbert, in a real sense, loves Lo. However, this results in him raping her and turning her into a child prostitute. A couple of years ago, I watched the movie Mysterious Skin, which takes the same theme even further: it's one of the most disquieting films I've ever seen. Has anyone else come across it? Would be interested to get reactions."}, {"userName": "s.penkevich", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich", "userReview": "Human life is but a series of footnotes to a vast obscure unfinished masterpiece.Opening a book is a unique conversation with another, the chance to enter and occupy the headspace of a writer, a character, a voice screaming out into the void. We see life\u2014our own world or fantastic realities that function as elaborate metaphors for our own\u2014through another\u2019s eyes, walk a mile in another\u2019s skin as Atticus Finch would say, and learn that despite the differences between individuals, we are all part of the same chorus of humanity. There has been much research into showing that reading assists the building of empathy in children, and many fine publications such as articles inThe Guardian or a similar one in Scientific American. Reading is a fresh perspective that helps us to shape our own. Lolita, a masterpiece by Vladimir Nabokov, takes us into the mind, heart and soul of a man none of us wish to become, yet Humbert Humbert\u2019s voice is as important to the human comedy as is anyone else\u2019s voice. Nabokov is a master of literary games and jokes, and Lolita is a work of art that often evokes knee-jerk reactions even just by mention of the title, which is precisely what Nabokov loves Nabokov has a fascination with literary games, detail and jokes, and Lolita is a gorgeously complex work that touches on taboo subjects to force our reaction and is loaded with allusions and important details and clues that invite us to play his game and learn. Vanity Fair called Lolita \u2018The only convincing love story of our century,\u2019 yet is it the relationship between Hubert and Dolores that is the love story (and tomes could be written debating the topic), or the love of literature? Lolita is a love story to language that soars through the stratosphere with some of the finest attention to detail in prose and plotting to seduce the reader into Humbert\u2019s literary vision of events as justification of the horrors that transpire.I\u2019ve no ideas to exploit, I just like composing riddles with elegant solutions - Nabokov*Nabokov is a supreme maestro of language. Few authors since Joyce have such acute attention to the supreme specifications of each word choice to build the maximum potential of a sentence. \u2018I only have words to play with\u2019 insists Humbert, and Nabokov uses words like playthings with the very best of them. Each noun, verb and adjective are precisely picked to elevate the tone of a scene through connotative commentary as well as attention to poetic flow, puns and general atmosphere. Even the names are exquisitely invented, from Lolita chosen for \u2018the necessary note of archness and caress\u2019 and the last name Haze being a pun on the German word hase, meaning rabbit, which is suggestive of her as prey. There is also the music of the name Humbert Humbert: \nthe double rumble is, I think, very nasty and suggestive. It is a hateful name for a hateful person. It is also a kingly name, and I needed a royal vibration for Humbert the Fierce and Humbert the Humble.\n The double rumble also exists with couples like John and Jean or Leslie and Louise to denote a cohesion of two individuals into a cumulative force of The Couple. Nabokov often rejects any interpretation of his work, insisting that it is just sheer creative force with nothing undermining the themes and symbols, a mere game of words being projected onto the page. While this may be a shirking of any Freudian (which he so detested) or deconstructionist interpretation, it is comforting to know that an author would pay such attention to words to build the perfect game board for the reader to immerse themselves in. America comes alive in his words and descriptions as Humbert and his charge travel the nation seeking any excuse for a sightseeing adventure. Even in the author's afterword Nabokov rejects the notion that Lolita is a commentary on America, or an examination of \u2018young America debauching Old Europe or vice versa. As intention is often overshadowed by interpretation, the reader may find much to discuss in the matter, but what is most important is to see Nabokov constructing a linguistic America through the observations and experiences of Humbert as he travels. \u2018It had taken me some forty years to invent Russia and Western Europe, said Nabokov in an interview discussing the creation of the novel, \u2018and now I was faced with a similar task, with a lesser amount of time at my disposal.\u2019 Nabokov set about inventing America in prose in Lolita, drawing on his travels and hotel stays with his wife on a butterfly hunting quest through the states to color the world of Humbert and create a true-to-life game board for his literary puzzles.You can always count on a murder for a fancy prose style.While the scintillating cacophony of words are the invention of Nabokov\u2019s, they are also of and through the character of Humbert Humbert. The aforementioned affection towards naming is part of Humbert\u2019s method of pseudonyms that both protect the \u2018real\u2019 in-novel people but also nudge towards Humbert\u2019s own literary bent This is a character that quotes and alludes to an erudite array of fiction in order to seek an authorial immortality of his own by putting his deeds to paper in eloquent fashion, both his immortality and that of his relationship with Dolores: \u2018and this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita.\u2019 One is left to question the validity of truth\u2014truth of the assertion of the novel as a realistic portrayal of the Novel\u2019s reality\u2014as expressed by its narrator. Humbert is unquestionably an unreliable narrator, much like many of Poe\u2019s narrators such as in The Cask of Amontillado through which every undergrad writes their first essay on unreliable narration.In a kingdom by the sea. The allusions to Poe\u2019s work is highly critical to the understanding of Lolita. As Humbert would wish it to be understood, Humbert\u2019s nymphomania stems from a romance pruned by death with Annabel Leigh during his youthful years. The two star-crossed pre-teens shared a summer fling before her untimely death, leaving Humbert\u2019s sexual attraction stunted to those of similar budding maturity. The name and the constant references to a kingdom by the sea allude to the poem Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe, an author who married his 13 year old cousin. In fact, Humbert repeatedly reminds readers that romance with young girls is rampant in literature, such as Dante and his nine-year-old Beatrice or Lewis Carroll\u2019s (another author frequently alluded to in the text) fixation with young girls, and that many cultures historically saw no qualms with union between man and pre-teen girls. Humbert is attempting to justify his actions by seeking sanctuary in history. However, his history of amourous occasions with Annabel Leigh should be called into question for validity as the aptly named Annabel may only exist in Humbert\u2019s literary vision of how things \u2018should be\u2019. Funny how Ms Leigh is only captured in a photograph where she is blurred and indistinguishable, a photograph that Humbert is unable to produce. Perhaps she is merely a justification, a romanticised fantasy befitting of her name.She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.It must be questioned then as to what we can believe from Humbert. Lolita is a name given to Dolores by Humbert alone, her mother preferring the diminutive \u2018Lo\u2019 (ponderously parallel to \u2018Hum\u2019). We understand Dolores only through the filter of Humbert and rarely do we even see her dialogue other than summarized by him. He insists that she was the one to seduce and sexualize him, but we are not present for the scene. Perhaps the seductive Lolita only exists in the mind of Humbert to accommodate his rationality and distract us, and himself, from the grisly truth of his statutory rape\u00b9. It would be interesting on a re-read to note every time Humbert refers to his step-daughter as Dolores, Lo, Dolly, or Lolita, as she seems to be Lolita only in the sexual moments. While Humbert insists upon his love for Lolita, often to win the heart of the reader by asserting genuine love, his love lands solely upon physical elements. She is repeatedly eyed over for her physical and sexual traits, but never for her personality or intellectual qualities (the latter of which he tends to condescend). The Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u2018lolita\u2019 as a precociously seductive girl, though a more accurate definition would be a precociously sexual girl as affected by rape. Nabokov teases the knee-jerk reaction in the reader, and while many refuse to read the novel due to it\u2019s taboo sexuality, it is equally disquieting how many thrive on it.\u00b2If, as Nabokov insists, the novel is not about the intermingling of Europe and America, perhaps the generational gap is the true investigation. While Humbert and his Lolita may have a relationship, there is an emotional gap of maturation that is evident even to Humbert. He sees in her stories an assertion of maturity that seems comical to adults, and her experimentation with sexuality reeks of juvenility to him, yet he pounces upon it like a lion lurking in the tall weeds. Humbert is highly vain and egotistical, constantly reminding the reader of his good looks. He even tells the reader that he looks similar to a music icon of whom which Dolores has a crush, a Dolores that falls victim to believing every magazine and commercial advertisement that falls her way. While Humbert is much older, he reflects the youth culture of intellectual and physical attraction and uses this to his advantage.[W]e are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader\u2019s mind.If Lolita is a joke, then the reader is the butt of it. As Dolores is seduced by Humbert, so is the reader by his charismatic ways. We are drawn into his world. into his justifications, enamored by his prose and then held in sick bondage to his will. We know that his story is a manifestation, yet we cannot escape it, practically don\u2019t want to escape it as a sort of perverted Stockholm Syndrome. We are even made implicit in his crimes. \u2018I need you, the reader, to imagine us, for we don't really exist if you don't,\u2019 he tells us, bringing us into his first sexual experience with Lolita to make us a part of it. If we condemn him, then we must condemn ourselves since we complicit with the act. We are bonded to him and unable to escape by the time we realize he has wooed us with his words as he has wooed Dolores with his looks and intellect. We, the reader, are his judge and jury as he sits in prison with a fatal heart condition (he slips so far into his literary reenactment of his crimes that he writes himself to be literally dying of a broken heart), and he seduces us to both pardon him of his crimes and immortalize both himself and his love-lust for Lolita through our eternal reading and remembrance of him. Everything we read has been tweaked to literary perfection to accommodate his fantasy in our minds. Even Dolly's socks become a metaphor through his retelling. When she is his pure nymphet, her socks are pulled up and pure white. Yet as she fades in his eyes, her socks are always described as rumpled and soiled. Socks are a permeating motif of the novel that is both a indication of Humbert's literary assertions and a thermometer of his passion and opinion of his step-daughter.Nabokov was obsessed with detail. In teaching he insisted upon maps of Dublin or Samsa\u2019s apartment to understand Joyce and Kafka respectively. He made students visualize a train car to understand Anna Karenina. This is the sort of book to rub in the faces of anyone who insists that a blue chair can be a simple blue chair and not a symbol. Those sort of writers, if they are published, are not remembered because we have writers like Nabokov where every blessed word is another beautiful piece to the puzzle. Nabokov invented his literary America to give a map for his character\u2019s to race across, and filled their travels with allusions, names made of anagrams, puns, jokes, and moral investigations. We cannot help but be seduced by Humbert become a further victim in his fantasy of Lolita drawn from the sensuality stolen between the legs of Dolores. While Humbert is a clear villain in a comedy of moral errors\u00b3 we realize that his illness is just one facet of him. We must remember when we condemn someone that there are many other facets of their personality and lives that aren\u2019t that unlike our own. This is Nabokov\u2019s joke on us all. \u2018The rest is rust and stardust.\u2019100/100I loved you. I was a pentapod monster, but I loved you. I was despicable and brutal, and turpid, and everything, mais je t\u2019aimais, je t\u2019aimais! And there were times when I knew how you felt, and it was hell to know it, my little one. Lolita girl, brave Dolly Schiller.*All quotes from the author, unless otherwise indicated, are taken from the interviews and essays of Nabokov collected in Strong Opinions. Furthermore, biographical information on Nabokov is lifted from Speak, Memory.\u00b9 Later in the novel Humbert drops his guard and recalls the sexual relationship between Hum and Lo as her left with hollow, sad eyes.\nI recall certain moments, let us call them icebergs in paradise, when after having had my fill of her \u2013after fabulous, insane exertions that left me limp and azure-barred\u2013I would gather her in my arms with, at last, a mute moan of human tenderness (her skin glistening in the neon light coming from the paved court through the slits in the blind, her soot-black lashes matted, her grave gray eyes more vacant than ever\u2013for all the world a little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major operation)\u2013and the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair, and I would lull and rock my lone light Lolita in my marble arms, and moan in her warm hair, and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing, and at the peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness\nThere is a sense of remorse for his actions that sprout through his narrative in the later portion of the novel and ask us to rethink our earlier perceptions. This account of intercourse reveals one that is not as one of willful harmony but aggressive assertion of dominance over a passive partner. \u00b2 Perhaps more people thrive on the Humbert justification than we\u2019d like to admit, or at least have learned how to capitalize on it. The New Republic once ran a fascinating article highly worth reading that addresses the \u2018lolita culture\u2019 in today\u2019s world of pop icons like Brittany Spears posing with a teddy bear in the nude (we acknowledge that she is not underaged but invokes the image of a young girl) or Katy Perry singing about copulation in a living room blanket fort like a child. Also of interest in the article is the town of Lolita, Texas where officials considered changing the town name to distance themselves from the novel.\u00b3 This novel is essentially a comedy, and is quite funny when you let your guard down. However, it is also a tragedy. Martin Amis provides a wonderful introduction that points out that the tragedy is not Humbert\u2019s fate, which he deserves, or his murder of Quilty. Nobody seems to pass judgement on his murder, enacted in a sick yet hilariously slapstick scene. The true tragedy is Dolores in her role as Lolita. \u2018He broke my heart. You merely broke my life.\u2019"}, {"userName": "F", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f", "userReview": "Beautiful but disgusting.

A portrait of a child molestor, not necessarily a sanctioning of one.She held that whatever it was, it was still about a child molestor, and disgusting. To me, this is the same argument that Huck Finn is a racist book because it depicts racism. I don't think that portraying something is the same as condoning it.Plus, the way Nabakov manipulates language is chillingly beautiful. Chilling.

But I can't do that. Not when the core of the book concerns the main character's obsession with girl children of twelve years of age. Not when he is so particular in his categorising of those girl children that he begins to sound horribly like a lepidopterist. The 'nymphets' he searches out have to fit the classification he has drawn up: there are precise measurements listed; there are exact skin tones and hair colours described: honey, peach for the skin, russet for the hair; there is a focus on the exact shape of their wing-like shoulder-blades and the exact texture of the fine down on their limbs; there is even a description of the way they must move. He is so rigid in his selection process that only very few meet his requirements, and when he finally succeeds in capturing one, he pins her triumphantly to his bedsheets. Hmm.There was clearly no way to avoid referring to all of that.I know, of course, that I'm dealing with an author who likes layers. For that reason, I was wide awake while reading Lolita, all senses on alert. The previous Nabokov books had taught me to look out for the meanings that lie beneath the surface, but as I read through the first half of this book, my awareness of the captive orphan theme overrode the sense of pleasure I experienced in the turns of phrase, the literary treasure hunts, the wordplay and the games that the author likes to play with the reader. Speaking of games, the scene I found the most disturbing was one in which Nabokov cleverly allowed his narrator, Humbert Humbert, to draw me deeply into his mindset. The scene takes place in the early pages when the narrator describes visiting an apartment in Paris where a young girl is offered to him by a procuress. The girl is sitting on a bed, holding a bald-headed doll, but since the girl is older and more developed than the type of 'nymphet' Humbert is looking for, he tries to leave, and a tussle with the procuress ensues. Then, a door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. They were misshapen, bare-necked, very swarthy, and one of them wore dark glasses. A small boy and a begrimed, bow-legged toddler lurked behind them. With the insolent logic of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he had served in the police, 'lui', so I had better do as I was told. I went up to Marie\u2014for that was her stellar name\u2014who by now had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool by the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll. With a surge of pity dramatising my idiotic gesture, I thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. She surrendered my gift to the ex-detective, whereupon I was suffered to leave.That brief peep into the misery of one family\u2019s life stayed with me; it somehow seemed more horribly real than all of the rest of the book. And it was because of the details in the description, the bow-legged toddler reclaiming her precious doll, the reprieved girl stoically resuming her supper, that I was more moved by that scene than by anything that came afterwards. Nabokov had engineered the situation so that I was somehow sharing in Humbert's distorted sympathy and simultaneous revulsion for those people; the details he thought important to record were details that overwhelmed me with their hopelessness. As I read on, I was aware of Nabokov arranging things to both entertain and discomfit me by turns, and he succeeded - the updates provide the history of my alternating state of attraction and repulsion up to about the half way mark.Once beyond that point, I began to understand and better appreciate what Nabokov was up to, or at the very least, I understood that he was up to something artistically and lexically interesting, and that his text was not about morality or immorality, that it was outside such terrain just as Proust\u2019s La Prisonni\u00e8re, also about an imprisoned orphan, lies beyond it. In the end notes, Nabokov disowns the ethical justification that his fictional editor 'John Ray' seeks to convey in the foreword, a message of vigilance to parents, social workers and educators. Instead, he tells us that Lolita has no moral in tow. For me, a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm. In so far as I understand Nabokov's statement, it conforms to what I believe to have been Proust\u2019s motivation also: a constant searching after the aesthetic quality of experience so that everything in life, however unsavoury, becomes grist to the art-mill.Returning to the imprisoned Albertine theme, there are more parallels than the simple fact that she and Dolores Haze are captives. Proust and Nabokov give their 'captive' characters a serious preoccupation with clothes, and allow their narrators to take great pleasure in choosing elaborate garments for their 'darling' captives. Both narrators are exasperated by the lack of culture their darlings insist on presenting and try to interest them in books and music and art without much success. In the meantime the darlings dally with other partners behind their besotted captors' backs, the darlings being far cleverer than their captors, so that the notion of captive and captor is reversed in the end. While we're on the subject of Proust (and non-Proust fans might want to skip the next two paragraphs), Dolores reminded me not only of his famous Albertine but also of Gilberte Swann as we meet her in the last section of Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann, when she is about twelve. In the afterword of Lolita, Nabokov provides the opening paragraph of a story that is his original of Lolita. It was called The Enchanter, and he wrote it in 1939 more than fifteen years before he wrote Lolita. There is a girl described on roller skates in the Tuileries gardens in Paris who sounds exactly like Gilberte: A violet-clad girl of twelve (he never erred), was treading rapidly and firmly on skates that did not roll but crunched on the gravel as she raised and lowered them with little Japanese steps and approached his bench through the variable luck of the sunlight\u2026. The description goes on and the resemblance to Gilberte as Proust's narrator first described her becomes clearer. There are other parallels with Proust I could point out, especially with regard to how both he and Nabokov describe colour and landscape. This passage highlights the similarity - I almost said parody: Beyond the tilled plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow suffusion of inutile loveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm, peeled-peach tinge pervading the upper edge of a two-dimensional, dove-grey cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist. There might be a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot still noons above a wilderness of clover, and Claude Lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background. Or again, it might be a stern El Greco horizon, pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of some mummy-necked farmer, and all around alternating strips of quick-silverish water and harsh green corn, the whole arrangement opening like a fan, somewhere in Kansas.The 'somewhere in Kansas' reads like a joke at the end.As well as displaying his art credentials, Nabokov leads the reader on a blistering literary paper chase referencing many characters and literary works. I'm encouraged to indulge myself in the same way (self-indulgence is not foreign to Lolita), and recall here all the literary characters who came to mind while I was reading about Dolores Haze. Two of Raymond Queneau's characters remind me of her: Sally Mara from Les \u0153uvres compl\u00e8tes de Sally Mara, and the twelve year-old Annette from Un rude hiver, a perky little person who seduces the apparently helpless and harmless narrator! I also thought of Gerty McDowell from Ulysses, although she is older admittedly. Nabokov makes several reverential references to Ulysses so it's possible she is an inspiration. Issy from Finnegans Wake he doesn't mention, but I think she resembles Dolores Haze too. Alice Lidell comes to mind as well, and she is mentioned once or twice. I also thought of Jonathan Swift's Stella - she was very young when they first met, in fact he was her tutor. And of course Dante's Beatrice - the girl Dante claimed to have loved since he first saw her aged nine. Nabokov mentions Beatrice a couple of times, but his main inspiration is Poe's Annabel Lee: Humbert talks frequently of the Annabel whom he loved long ago in a kingdom by the sea, parodying Poe without the slightest blush.There is a lot of parody and even some outright farce in Lolita. Nabokov doesn't bother inventing names, for example, resorting instead to some hilarious excuses for names: Mrs Opposite (the woman who lived opposite), Miss Pratt (who lived up to her name), Mr Trapp, a detective figure, and lots more. He plays similar games with place names and it's fun figuring out the clues embedded in the names.The most farcical character is Clare Quilty, a kind of mirror image of the main character, Humbert (and Humbert comes from 'ombre' meaning shadow or shade in French, while Clare is pronounced similarly to 'claire', which means light or clear). The idea of characters having a mirror image was a theme I noticed in The Real Life of Sebastian Knight and was present in Pale Fire too, with Charles Kinbote mirroring John Shade, and in Pnin where the narrator is a kind of enhanced mirror image of the unfortunate Pnin. The mirror idea recalls a chess board too, another common metaphor in Nabokov's books, so it's not surprising that Lolita can be seen as a giant chess game where the United States of America is the actual board. Quilty and Humbert chase each other across the board and back again in an attempt by each to steal the other's Queen. The end of Lolita can be described as a perfect stalemate: nobody wins but nobody loses. My experience of the book was similar: I wasn't always super happy while reading it but nevertheless, I opened my fifth Nabokov as soon as I finished.."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395209-melissa", "userReview": "I feel like a mental midget in trying to explain my feelings about this book. I struggle to understand why it is considered such a classic piece of literature. Am I jaded by my own time? Have I heard too often the world \"lolita\" used in modern contexts to refer to young girls who are attractive to adult men who should know better? I had to delve into some literary criticism in order to help me understand, and I think what Lolita tries to do is tell a disguting story about a disgusting man using beautiful language. I think it also speaks to our modern day inclination to want to explain ourselves, as if we could absolve ourselves from the horrors of the crimes we commit if it is understood why we did it. Listening to the audiobook, although fabulously read by Jeremy Irons, probably meant that the language was lost on me for the most part. Instead I was left with the story of this self-described monster who destroys a child's life and feels remorse only at losing her. Perhaps revolutionary in its storytelling at the time it was published, but too gross to read today."}, {"userName": "Eli", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162638-eli", "userReview": "This book scared the living daylights out of me. As everyone says - its gorgeously written. The language is so rich that it somehow spills over the sentences - there's more to them than you can easily ingest. The writing makes the whole thing a pleasure to read, and in a lot of ways puts Nabakov in control from the start - there isn't a lot of room to imagine motives since Nabakov explains so much. I should point out that were a lesser writer spend any time at all writing in a language I can't read, I may have been tempted to put the whole thing down, but that here, despite entire passages in French, it never crossed my mind to do anything but read on. There is a recurring temptation to read this as a love story. Humbert Humbert is lovingly obsessed with Lolita. Since he's the narrator of the story, his passion is the lens through which everything is viewed. But Nabakov allows just enough of the unfiltered (fictional) reality through to make it pretty clear that this is a story about a frightened, terribly abused little hostage and her tormentor. The constant flips between seeing Humbert as unfortunately in love with the wrong person, and him as a monster sucking every bit of life out of his prisoner is what is so frightening. It begs the question - how much of reality could we all reconfigure to fit our obsession, or even our love? The characters, at least Lolita and Humbert are brilliant and true. Lolita is deeply sympathetic, and at points, so is Humbert. The place of the book is everywhere in motion, and little pinpoints across the country are written about with confidence and clarity. The settings precisely frame the story. There is enough disturbing erotisism that I felt a little strange reading it in broad public view, but it its certainly not explicit in any traditional sense. Brilliant, complex and extraordinarily readable, this is a book of such force and depth, that it seemed to me nearly impossible to get the whole picture on a single reading. It is definitely one I will pick up again."}, {"userName": "Franco  Santos", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29931457-franco-santos", "userReview": "Ay, Humbert Humbert, qu\u00e9 raro me hace sentir.

The character of Humbert Humbert has become a well-known and much-interpreted part of 20th century literature, and ever since its publication, Nabokov's novel has been banned for certain periods of time in France, England, Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa due to its difficult contents. Focusing on the life of highly intelligent and incalculable Humbert Humbert and his delusional sexual fascination with Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze, aged 12 at the beginning of this novel, Nabokov will take you on a journey you will not forget about.Even in spite of all the controversy surrounding its contents, Lolita has turned into one of the most influencial books from the last century, often referred to as a book everyone has to read once in their lifetime. Apparently, according to various internet sources, Nabokov was so disgusted by the character of Humbert himself that he almost burned the manuscript - which is understandable, as the nature of our protagonist's thoughts and deeds are difficult to understand and sometimes even painful to think about.First, let's take a look at Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert from the 1997 movie adaption:This is the man I have imagined Humbert to look like throughout the entire course of the novel. Because even though Humbert is a paedophile on the inside, he appears to be a friendly, charming and interesting man on the outside. Humbert is a man whose lies people easily fall for, whose intricate net of self-invented stories it is difficult to elude without having the ability to look inside his head, as Vladimir Nabokov allowed us to. As disgusting and repulsive as Humbert's deeds were, they were always confided inside his soul. He is a man who visits prostitutes and imagines them to be 13 or 14 years old in order to gain sexual pleasure from his visit, a man who tricks people into not realizing the real nature of his character, a man who marries Charlotte Haze only in order to be close to her daughter Lolita who he feels sexually attracted to. Humbert is a man who tricks even himself into thinking that no matter how severe the crime he committed, its performance has been inevitable as a result of his personality.Humbert pleads with the reader to understand his feelings of guilt and remorse, yet he never truly considers the possibility of accepting responsibility for the sickness of his behaviour. Nabokov masterfully explores the themes embedded in this novel, using word plays, elements of humor and beautiful descriptions to pull the reader into the story. Nabokov's prose is likely going to surprise you with its beauty, juxtaposing the ugliness of Humbert's character. Moreover, the author loves to play with language, sometimes even makes up new words; you will frequently see the narrator drifting off into the usage of French vocabulary. My French was good enough to understand the meaning of those parts, yet I can imagine how distracting and confusing they might be for a reader without knowledge of the French language.Ultimately, Humbert doesn't only seduce Lolita, he also seduces the reader with his words and thoughts. And yet, can the book really be described as a story about a guilty perpetrator and an innocent victim? In 1958, American writer Dorothy Parker wrote a review for this book, calling Lolita \"a dreadful little creature, selfish, hard, vulgar, and foul-tempered\" - and nobody could judge her for this characterization. Even now, after having finished the book and thought about it for more than a month, I don't know what to make of Lolita's character. I can only encourage everyone to read this novel and create an own image of Lolita, a girl who perhaps couldn't even tell you who she is herself.Interestingly, Nabokov wrote the novel while on butterfly-collection trips in the western United States, mirroring the cross-country journey of Lolita and Humbert which took place in the novel. Nabokov succeeded in painting an intriguing and stunning picture of the American 40's and early 50's, turning his novel not only into the journey through a human being's mind, but also into an epic trip across the United States. It should also be noted that Nabokov himself disagreed with all the different editions featuring a young girl on the cover as those images cause the general idea of Lolita being an erotica novel. Maybe I should be glad about owning a simple hardcover edition with a purely plain-coloured binding.The book made me extremely uncomfortable during parts of the story, but it has been written to do so. I don't believe any reader could be comfortable during the lecture of this novel, and thus I will recommend it only to people who are completely convinced of reading about the troubled and controversial life of Humbert Humbert. But if you can appreciate complex and intelligent stories, layered writing and beautiful prose, you should give it a chance to find out for yourself what this novel is actually about."}, {"userName": "Delee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168268-delee", "userReview": "4.5It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know By the name of Annabel Lee.
