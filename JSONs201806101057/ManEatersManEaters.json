I\u2019m a zombie apocalyptic fan and this was a straight up zombie busting adventure. This book was originally released as Man Eaters by Linda Kay Silva. It has been updated, re-edited and released under Alex Westmore who is Silva\u2019s pen name. I\u2019m a Silva/Westmore fan so I\u2019m not surprised I enjoyed this.This was one of the more entertaining zombie books I have read in a while. Yes you have to suspend disbelief a bit, but in what zombie book does that not happen. I just sat back and enjoyed the action. I could not put the book down until 6am, it was just that exciting. The main character Dallas, I like but she is a little too bleeding heart for a zombie apocalypse. She seems to be getting her edge more so I\u2019m hopeful she will make better decisions in the future. The cowgirl Roper I liked quite a bit, she is someone I would want around when the zombies came.The romance is slow burn, not a lot of time for romance with the USA crumbling around you. But I still enjoyed it and liked the two mains together. I\u2019m hoping for a little more romance in the next few books.One of the big zombie twists is actually pretty funny. It\u2019s a suspend disbelief moment, but I liked it anyway. When it comes to why the whole zombie attacked happened is a little ridiculous, but it leaves lots of plotlines open for the other books.If you are looking to read something that is Walking Dead-ish but with two kickass lesbians leading the way, give this book a shot. Don\u2019t take this book too seriously, than you can sit back and enjoy the ride. This series is available for free with Kindle Unlimited."}, {"userName": "M", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6152123-m", "userReview": "It's been a long time since I have written a review, for a combination of factors, but I'm back and hope to be more active in the coming months. Well what do I think of this book?Mixed bag, some things are very well realised and play out in a believable manner (within reason, this is a Zombie apocalypse story after all), while others fell flat for me. I know it's a familiar trope that very quickly large numbers of people become complete douche bags but the whole of the military and politicians as well as the majority of survivors?My belief in humanity was stretched thin. Writing was good, even if the storyline was plucked directly from an episode of the Walking Dead and the characters (other than Einstein) seemed two dimensional. On to the next in the series that promises to advance the plot beyond immediate survival."}, {"userName": "Thibaut Nicod\u00e8me", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22674620-thibaut-nicod-me", "userReview": "This review convinced me to read this."}, {"userName": "Sean C", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14089303-sean-c", "userReview": "Where do I begin,...- First of all, let me be clear that I have no problem with homosexuality. I have a close family member that is gay and to be frank, I don't care who you or anyone sleeps with. As long as it is a consenting adult, it's none of my business. It's your life, go live it, I support your right to do so. Screw who you want, marry who you want - none of my business. - That said, the author is clearly a heterophobe (hater of heterosexuals). All the heroes are gay and all the @ssholes are straight and SPOILER ALERT guess what, the zombies have been genetically programmed to only kill and eat heterosexuals. Really? You seriously want us to buy that? - The author is also a misandrist (hater of men). Again, almost all of the likable characters are women, children or gay men. All the @ssholes are, you guessed it, men. Wow - could you project just a little bit more for the cheap seats that can't hear you (in Siberia). The zombies in the book are called \"man eaters\" - not \"zombies\", not \"undead\", not \"walkers\", but \"man eaters\". Here is a quote from a gun battle late in the book: \"Man after man, she tore apart with one of the enormous rounds\" Note, she doesn't call them \"soldiers\" or \"hostiles\" or \"enemies\". She very specifically calls them men. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, chances are the author is definitely a misandrist. - As a zombie story, this is weak. The zombies appear, the government immediately goes into \"slaughter anything that moves\" mode and the story is a series typical zombie movie scenes: zombies chase main characters, main characters encounter hostile non-zombies, new members join and others leave, etc. Nothing all that original.- The author interjects completely inappropriate romance into the plot line. The two main characters fall in love within a few days of an END OF THE WORLD APOCALYPSE. Another one falls in love with another member of the military after spending a couple of days together and again just a couple of weeks into an APOCALYPSE. Clearly the author wanted to write a romance novel, but for some insane reason felt a zombie apocalypse was the perfect backdrop. Very weak.- The characters are ridiculous, especially the main ones. Dallas is introduced a Harley riding female firefighter that within days is reduced to a blubbering idiot whenever her new girlfriend appears to be in danger. WTF happened to her? Is she bi-polar? The two main characters have complete faith in a young man who's knowledge of zombies he admits comes from movies and video games. Despite these completely FICTIONAL sources, he is right about everything every single time. How is that even possible???- The conspiracy theories abound. The author pulls no punches in blaming the government and laying responsibility for all of this on them. It is after all run by men, right. And, of course the theories get confirmed in the end. No surprise there.- I will give her credit for making light of religion and the Christians (I am an atheist). Of course, the author can't just do that. She has to get a pro-gay rant in there: one of the main characters elects not to protect some other survivors who are Christian even though she could have because Christians gave gays a hard time in the past. Nice. When a kid gets torn apart moments later, all the characters are cool with it - he was straight and Christian after all, so it's all good.I read this entire book despite wanting to give up several times. There are just way to many things that come along that you say to yourself \"give me a break - even in a zombie apocalypse, that's just not believable\" when you add all of this together, I very quickly went from \"looking for things to like\" to \"looking for things I'd never like\" over the course of reading this book. Heterophobes and misandrists will love it - everyone else will accurately call it garbage. Thankfully, I did not pay any money for this book."}, {"userName": "P. Industry", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29398373-p-industry", "userReview": "Man Eaters is a good book - a very high three stars. It blends action, adventure, romance, and horror together in a fairly robust and coherent way; the decisions made along the way felt like they had real consequences down the track, and even if some of the character deaths felt forced, they still had real emotional impact.Dallas Barkley finds herself in a pickle; one day she's riding her motorbike to work, and the next she's dodging zombies (\u201cman-eaters\u201d) and military helicopters, trying to get across the country to relative zones of safety. Joined in her quest is Roper (the fearless, ruthless cowgirl), Einstein (the incredibly valuable video game nerd), Butcher (the former medic), and a host of other minor characters as they dodge, kill and survive the zombie apocalypse.The book is good. Although my willing suspension of disbelief was challenged on several occasion, and the explanation provided for the zombies at the end was totally bat-insane ridiculous, it was an enjoyable experience to watch Dallas mow through zombies. The feeling of barely controlled panic was palpable, and the reactions of the other survivors seemed believable and moderately realistic. Some plot elements \u2013 like the reason the zombies attack one person over another \u2013 ignore complex questions of identity and social pressure. Some other plot elements gloss over important geopolitical realities \u2013 like how financially dependant the rest of the world is on the American economy. Those parts of the book are dumber than a box of hair. But the remainder is a pretty fun ride, and it left me feeling pretty good about my decision to purchase it."}, {"userName": "P.

It happens from time to time and it usually takes a really great book to break the slump and get me back on the book wagon so to speak.This book - was just that book.It started right in the heart of the action and kept going at that pace throughout the book. The plot advanced quickly (and violently at times) without sacrificing character development or the relationships that form between the ever changing and evolving cast of characters.I loved this writer's take on how the zombie virus broke out and the why of certain populations not being effected.I won't lie. Parts of this book were sad and made me cry. It was an emotional roller-coaster, but I loved it."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12010905-diane", "userReview": "Well written and interesting storyThis book kept me engaged from the beginning to the end.

The main character Dallas upset me so much though out the book. Oh my godd the girl has too big a heart. It's the zombie apocalypse and she wants to pick up every stray dog along the way, my God she is the most annoying main character I've ever seen. I literally wanted to shoot her right in the face so many times when she either picked up some clearly questionable people or she surrendered to thugs who her group clearly outnumbered without a fight. Even down to the last part of the book when she learned her lesson like 50 times already, she was still out here tryna save people. Like girl ur humanity is great and all but definitely not for this apocalypse.Other than that, the book was great, I'll definitely be reading the others in the series"}, {"userName": "Riley T", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43044015-riley-t", "userReview": "I really wish I could give a better rating here, but it just constantly shoots itself in the foot. For a zombie man eater apocalypse, there's very little tension. A hummer gets shot with a missile? We already know who's in it. Someone gets kidnapped? Better end this scene and go check up on them. Uh oh, some bad men are about to teach our heroine- And she's rescued. So much of the dialogue is just blah blah blah the military blah blah blah the government blah blah blah... We get it. Big bad government is doing bad things. Talk about something else. Anything else."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16222426-kristen", "userReview": "Honestly, Alex Westmore is one of the most underrated authors I've read. Her books are just on point. They're full of adventures, they are written so well, they are face paced, they are filled with great characters. They might be written under the LBGT genre. But I read all of her books at this point and I'm a straight woman, telling you that they're THAT good. Some books have sex, some don't. I don't find them important, so I gloss over them. I focus on the stories themselves. And I love them.This series though is about zombies. Honestly I hate zombie books or the \"End of the World\" type of books. Even tv shows about zombies I'm not fond of. Although I loved \"Warm Bodies.\" That one was also an exception. Anyway, this series made me change my mind. I can't even explain it. It was incredible how Alex sucked me into this series. I just couldn't stop reading and wondering what will happen next?!As for the story, Dallas finds herself in a massive zombie outbreak in California. People are running. Army Helicopters are blowing up bridges and shooting down people. In the middle of a bridge that's falling apart in San Francisco, she meets Roper another woman who saves her life and \"Einstein\" who is a young but very smart boy who's obsessed with Zombie lore. With Einstein's knowledge, they are able to figure out how to make the best escape. The three run away from the massive disaster and figure out how to live in this new world where zombies were created from a biological weapon. They have to find safe harbor and avoid from being bitten. Not only that, they can't even trust the government who's killing people because they are super paranoid about who's affected or who's not.In the middle of all that, the former lesbian firefighter finds herself a leader as she falls in love, adds new people to her group along her journey, leading them to safety. She makes hard decisions, nothing is taken lightly in this new world. You have to really fight for your own survival. This is her journey through a country that isn't America anymore. And I'm telling you, it might be a long journey, but it sure is filled with action, zombies, love, friendship and adventures."}, {"userName": "Tammy K.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4626742-tammy-k", "userReview": "Have you ever had a book where you simply loved the beginning you were certain it would be a five star book? One where you couldn't find a \"good\" spot to end for the night? One that while you were reading it, you were also thinking of all the people who you would recommend it too?And then... It went horribly wrong?This was that book for me.I loved the plot twist, which for the sake of avoiding spoilers I will not reveal. Honestly I was smiling at the twist.I loved the main characters. They were both relatable and believable.I enjoyed the steady pace of the plot. There was never a dull moment.So what went wrong?Politics. Sadly this book went from a zombie apocalypse action packed thrill ride into a medium for the author to throw spears at \"the other\" side. *deep sigh*It started off slow and small with a jab at \"republicans\" then progressed with a blow towards Christians and spiraled out of control with a couple paragraphs of ranting about America, her \"place\" in the world, the \"damage\" that this author feels our nation and her military has caused and so on.I was so disgusted with the rant that I'm deducting two full stars for the lack of enjoyability this hostility produced in this book.It's really too bad too, because had it not been for these rants, this title would have received 5 stars and a full endorsement from me. :-( I'll end my review with this pleaI'm always looking for books with positively portrayed LGBT characters. However, I do not enjoy LGBT fiction which portrays the world as completely homophobic, nor ones where all republicans are painted as evil & all Christians as over-judgmental, these are stereotypes/exaggerations. We have rights now & Churches that accept us. There's no need to be divisive & hostile towards society as a whole. I love to read authors that \"show\" us change. By letting their stories teach through hope & painting for us a world of tolerance. So we all can envision the hopes & dreams of more accepting world. In short, be part of the solution not another spear thrower."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8207460-erin", "userReview": "What I think is most disconcerting about the zombie apocalypse is how real it can actually turn out to be. The thought of humans being infected with something that causes them to rise from the dead and feed on live humans is disturbingly possible and Linda Kay Silva brings this possibility to a whole new level of believability. The two main characters of Dallas and Roper are exactly the type of women I would want to emulate when the plague occurs. They are both strong in body as well as in heart. The plague leaves undead to wander the streets looking for their next meal but just as deadly are the other survivors with their kill or be killed mentality who are out to test their humanity. As Dallas and Roper navigate through all the dangers on their way to survival Silva does an incredible job of putting the reader on the edge of her seat as zombies moan up to windows looking for a meal, survivors turn on each other and the military proves it can't be trusted. There are spooks, adventure, love and honor all along the way. Silva brought all aspects of an escape to safety by this hodge podge group of women and children to a creepy level that I couldn't put down until I found all the answers. If you want a rush from reading a book with two strong women out to survive this is the one to read. Put it this way, I won't be sleeping well tonight and have already double checked all the locks on the door.
