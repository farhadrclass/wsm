It is only September (and not even chilly out yet!), but I'm already thinking about the winter holidays, frosting cookies, and warm mugs of chocolate and cider. If you bake and will have any small children at hand this winter, Amy Fellner Dominy and Nate Evans\u2019 picture book Cookiesaurus Rex, illustrated by A.G. Ford is a fun read-aloud pick. Cookiesaurus Rex is looking forward to be decorated, but that excitement quickly turns to frustration when he sees his fellow cookies decorated with stars and sprinkles while he only has simple green icing and a black top hat. So Cookiesaurus decides to go rogue \u2013 except he doesn't get quite the revenge he wanted. He's decorated as a dinosaur ballerina, a duck, a baby (complete with chocolate chip poo!) instead. In between those episodes he decorates himself as a ninja and a superhero, only for it all to be wiped away. In the end he goes hog wild with decorations and declares himself the King of All Cookies - but there's a catch!Cookiesaurus Rex is engaging and silly fun, with a cookie main character full of attitude. The dialogue will make kids laugh and adults smile, and the content (and ideas for decoration) would make it the perfect complement or preview to a cookie decorating session. In fact, I was inspired to buy a T. Rex cookie cutter myself and try my hand at recreating some of Cookiesaurus' looks. Unfortunately, I didn't use icing tools so it ended up a little sloppy!Of course, you don't have to wait for winter to have a cookie-baking and -decorating session, and there's no hint of holiday affiliation in the book itself, so this title works for everyone and year-round fun. Cookiesaurus' antics are sure to amuse and inspire all who read the book.In all, Cookiesaurus Rex is a fun, sassy picture book suitable for all ages, and especially for bakers and their minions.Recommended for: fans of baking, cookies, dinosaurs and dialogue-heavy picture books (the ones you do voices with!)."}, {"userName": "Gmr", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2699650-gmr", "userReview": "Readers of all ages will be ROARing with delight as we see our growly friend go from dignified top hat wearing dino to a ballerina, a clown, and a few things in-between. The funniest to me? The baby...and what the illustrator does with those requested chocolate chips, BAHAHAHAHA! As the story progresses, Cookisaurus Rex is determined to get exactly what he wishes...but, um, yeah...while it's filled to the brim with humor, it DOES remind us why we should always be ever so careful what we wish for...*gulp*...and always remember NOT to bite the hand that feeds us...or decorates us.**copy received for review"}, {"userName": "Vi (the Vi3tBabe)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4487246-vi-the-vi3tbabe", "userReview": "I thought this was a cute book, very simple and entertaining.

I will say that it ended kind of abruptly, so I didn't like that, but the kids didn't mind, so it all worked out. I mean, as soon as I was done reading it, they would want to read it again.

Ford bring this colorful and silly story to life. The story explores the creative designs of a cookie decorator and a determined dinosaur cookie. A back and forth battle begins when Rex realizes\u00a0other cookies are getting stars, gummies, and sprinkles. Giggles quickly ensued. Admittedly even Noona\u00a0laughed when a silly moment happened involving chocolate chips. I love that after a few reads, Sophia was able to read the story to me.Cookiesaurus Rex is the perfect read for a small group or merely cuddling with your child.Copy provided by the publisher.

I imagine that this story will elicit lots of baking and decorating desires after reading, as well! It's fun to think about a big, bad, bossy T-Rex wanting sprinkles and sparkles and struggling to stay in control as the decorator creates. Although we never really find out the gender of the decorator, I generalize to \"him\" because the illustrator is a male. A.G. Ford's illustrations are so much fun and I wondered how much hands-on cookie research he completed to create such realistic cookies. They really do look delicious and as if a he had studied a master-cookie-decorator! The all-dialogue text and use of speech bubbles will prompt some super fun writing at the early primary levels. It will be helpful for young students to dig deep into their schema and access past experiences that deal with the underlying themes of jealousy, dashed pre-conceived expectations, and greed. The story is written almost exclusively in the voice of T-Rex, with little character interaction. He reacts to what the hidden decorator is doing throughout the story and the other characters are bystanders. The illustrations show alternate cookie-character reactions (facial expressions) to T-Rex and it would be fun to discuss what the characters are thinking. Near the end of the story, T-Rex notices that the other cookies are looking at him. Two alternate cookies have one speech bubble each, which are colored the same as T-Rex's speech bubbles throughout the story. For young readers, a distinction in color would have been helpful, even as a read-aloud. But, the play on words cannot be denied and is an amusing way to end the story.This light tale greets the deeper theme of jealousy with humor and will be a fun read aloud.I received a review copy of this book from Disney-Hyperion in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36594604-bethany", "userReview": "I received and AR copy for an honest review.COOKIESAURUS REX is a light, comedic read for children that involves decorating cookies, like a dinosaur, a dog, and a horse.Cookiesaurus Rex is the self-proclaimed King of All Cookies. Therefore, he deserves the best decorations that are available. When he sees other cookies being decorated fancier than him with stars, sprinkles, and gum drops, he gets jealous and tries to take matters into his own hands.Cookiesaurus Rex turns himself into fun things, such as a superhero and a ninja. The child/decorator counters it by turning him into a clown and other funny things. It was entertaining to see what Cookiesaurus Rex would become next. It's the cookie form of dress up.Final Verdict: This was an original read all about cookie fun and decorating. It's perfect for children 4 and older and something I could see being read while baking cookies to make it more interesting. Parents and children can bake their own Cookiesaurus Rex after reading it. I give it an easy 4.5 stars for illustrations and plot."}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "3.5 stars. \"Cookiesaurus Rex\" is the story of the biggest, baddest cookie of them all. Cookiesaurus Rex is a cookie shaped like a t-rex. All Cookiesaurus wants is frosting befitting his self-styled moniker: king of all the cookies.
