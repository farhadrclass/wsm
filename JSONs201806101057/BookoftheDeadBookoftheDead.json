The premise was to write short fiction based on what happened after George Romero's The Night of The Living Dead. The authors had a field day with this. Most of them go for dark comedy laced with splatter-punk horror. Best stories? Stephen King's \"Home Delivery\". Joe R. Lansdale's \"On the Far side of the Cadillac Desert With Dead Folks\", Edward Bryant's \"A Sad Last Love at the Diner of the Damned\", and Robert McCammon's \"Eat Me\". May be a little hard to find but well worth hunting for if you're a zombie fan."}, {"userName": "Ken McKinley", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5919799-ken-mckinley", "userReview": "In the 1980s, the only person that was doing anything significant with zombies was the Godfather himself, George Romero. In horror fiction, zombie stories were as dead as the zombies themselves. Then, in 1989, this little gem of a collection came along and among it's pages were some heavy hitters from the horror and sci-fi genre. If you're looking for chills and scares, keep moving. You won't find them here. But, if you're looking for good, campy fun ala Tales from the Crypt types of zombie stories, by all means, sink your teeth into this perverted bag of goodies. And I mean perverted. Many of these stories have either zombie sex or the biting off of penises in there somewhere. Two stand out tales for me that left me crying laughing were On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks by Joe Lansdale and Jerry's Kids Meet Wormboy by David Schow. Those two alone were worth the price of admission. Here's my take on each one. Blossom - Chan McConnellThe dangers of hooking up with someone you don't know and having an exotic fetish all while the zombie apocalypse is beginning. Enjoyed the irony of this one. 4 out of 5 stars Mess Hall - Richard LaymonIt's never good to be a serial killer and be around your victims when the zombie apocalypse happens. I've had issues with the two Laymon novels that I've read being extremely juvenile with unbelievable characters or story lines. But, this short story was the exact opposite. In fact, I loved this short story so much that I'm going to give his novels another try. 5 out of 5 stars It Helps If You Sing - Ramsey CampbellDoor-to-door Jehovah's Witness zombies + Haiti voodoo = a bad day. Just ok. Not my favorite. 2 out of 5 stars Home Delivery - Stephen KingMaddie Pace is the most indecisive woman you'll ever meet. Trying to determine what can of soup to buy out of all those choices on the shelf will send her running from the store without buying anything. But when the dead begin to rise on Genneseault Island, Maddie has already forced herself to cope. Good characters but felt incomplete. It seemed more like a snippet from a longer story.  3 out of 5 stars Wet Work - Philip NutmanSoldiers are clearing out a school during the zombie apocalypse. These soldiers aren't doing what you think they are. Nice little twist. 4 out of 5 stars A Sad Last Love at the Diner of the Damned - Edward BryantThe small town of Fort Durham, Colorado is experiencing the days after the dead turned. Martha is a waitress at the local diner and the focus of many of the male residents lustful attention. But, pretty Martha only has eyes for the young deputy sheriff, Bobby Mack, and the other men don't like this. They don't like it at all. And when things go to hell, they come to take what they want. 5 out of 5 stars Bodies and Heads - Steve Rasnic TemEither I completely missed the point of this story or it's a mess. Elaine is the nurse in a hospital where they have patients that rapidly shake their heads back and forth (as if they're saying no, no, no) and they have to restrain them from shaking as they try to feed them. But, they don't eat or attack them and then the one rips his own head off at the end. Hey, if you \"get\" this story, please explain it to my dumb ass. 1 out of 5 stars Choices - Glen VaseyDawson writes his thoughts down in a spiral notebook as he's going through the trials and tribulations of the zombie apocalypse. It was little more than a boring set of philosophical ramblings. A slight twist at the end that was too little too late to turn this yawn-fest around. An absolute chore to get through. 1 out of 5 stars The Good Parts - Les DanielsZombie sex. Who would've thought? Pretty ridiculous even for a zombie story. But it had an interesting hypothesis on what happened to the zombies over time. 2 out of 5 stars Less Than Zombie - Douglas WinterA twisted spoof of Less Than Zero, zombie style. Totally rad. Totally. 3 out of 5 stars Like Pavlov's Dog - Steven R. BoyettAn assault on an Ecosphere project in the Arizona desert with trained zombies. Nice writing style and character development.  4 out of 5 stars Saxophone - Nicholas RoyleThe zombie apocalypse was started as a result of a war breaking out between old communist block Europe and the Allies (you have to remember this book was written in the late 1980s) when the Allies retaliated with chemical weapons. The zombies can think and begin to wage their own war. Lots of interesting ideas in a story of irony about a zombie who was previously a jazz saxophonist. Good stuff. 5 out of 5 stars On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks - Joe R. LansdaleA bounty hunter is bringing his fugitive across the desert when they run into a whacked out cult leader who also happened to have caused the zombie apocalypse. I Loved Lansdale's writing and it actually made me LOL at least a half dozen times. 5 out of 5 stars Dead Giveaway - Brian HodgeEven zombies enjoy game shows, but it's all about the ratings, baby. 4 out of 5 stars Jerry's Kids Meet Wormboy - David J. SchowThe morbidly obese kid that was the butt of all the jokes in high school squares off against a television evangelist and his army of disciple zombies. A piss-your-pants hilarious story.  5 out of 5 stars Eat Me - Robert McCammonTwo zombies find love in a singles bar. Warped fun. 4 out of 5 stars You can also follow my reviews at the following

Some of the stories took me really long to finish because I just wasn't interested in them, but I only finished because I hate leaving books half finished. The concept of the book was really cool & I like the idea of it, but I feel like some of the writers & stories should have been taken out & replaced by better ones. I like how everybody had there own concept of the zombie story, but it still was a little off for me.

Overall it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't over the top either."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10832609-c", "userReview": "I\u2019m starting to feel a little like the host on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d when the show\u2019s almost over and they have to introduce that week\u2019s music guest for the second time. \u201cOnce again, ZOMBIES.\u201dYawn.On the bright side, this zombie anthology, BOOK OF THE DEAD, is not only a mass market anthology, but it\u2019s pretty much the forerunner to just about every other zombie book out there. Published in 1989 and edited by John Skipp and Craig Spector, BOOK OF THE DEAD is a collection of zombie stories set in the world of George Romero\u2019s Living Dead movies. Authors include such notables as Ramsey Campbell, Douglas E. Winters, Joe R. Lansdale, Robert R. McCammon, and of course Stephen King. While I don\u2019t believe every story stuck to the idea of being set in the Romero universe, they certainly offered a plethora of original zombie fiction, stuff not even the current zombie anthologies are publishing.In Richard Laymon\u2019s \u201cMess Hall\u201d, a woman, Jean, and her lover Paul are confronted mid-coitus by a serial killer, the Reaper. Not the most original, I\u2019ll grant you. The Reaper gets Paul out of the way and hauls Jean to the \u201cmess hall\u201d where he stages his killings, leaving the bodies for the animals to do away with. Only this particular night, he discovers the animals don\u2019t always finish what\u2019s on their plates and when whatever it was that made the dead come back to life happens, the victims all return seeking vengeance.Steve Rasnic Tem offers \u201cBodies and Heads\u201d which finds nurse Elaine disturbed by the epidemic of shaking heads. People all over town are being admitted and confined in the hospital where Elaine works, having lost all mental capacity as well as control of their bodies. The patients are kept strapped down while their heads shake violently back and forth in a \u201cno no no\u201d gesture. Meanwhile outside of town the world is falling to pieces as the dead are walking the earth, feasting on the living. Elaine wonders if what\u2019s happening to the dead may be connected to what\u2019s happening to the patients, perhaps some form of airborne virus that doesn\u2019t need a bite to infect you. In the end, the secret to the shaking heads and what happens to them is, in standard Tem form, absolutely amazing and unexpected.Brian Hodge\u2019s \u201cDead Giveaway\u201d gives the walking dead new life as former TV host Monty plays to the masses every night on television as the star, and only living crew member, of the hit game show \u201cDead Giveaway\u201d. Living dead spin a wheel and win a prize.\u201cWho\u2019ll ever forget last May twenty-third?\u201d said the announcer, as cheerful and bouncy as ever. \u201cFlight nine-oh-one out of O\u2019Hare Airport?

Direct to you from cold storage in the Cook County Morgue, it\u2019s the last of flight nine-oh-one! Courtesy of DEAD GIVEAWAY.\u201dI was surprised in this anthology just how many stories featured living dead that thought, spoke, carried on as normal. \u201cA Sad Last Love at the Diner of the Damned\u201d by Edward Bryant featured a revenge-seeking deadhead. Steven R. Boyett\u2019s \u201cLike Pavlov\u2019s Dogs\u201d showed the dead being trained and herded (as did David J. Schow\u2019s \u201cJerry\u2019s Kids Meet Wormboy\u201d). In Robert McCammon\u2019s \u201cEat Me\u201d, two living dead meet up at a singles bar for a night of grotesque love.For diversity and style, BOOK OF THE DEAD is about as good a zombie anthology as you\u2019re likely to find. However, when you\u2019re talking ease, this book took way too long to read. 16 days for me, which is way longer than 390 pages should take, and I attribute part of that, surely, to this being the 4th or 5th zombie book I\u2019ve read in recent weeks, but part of it is also due to length. If I\u2019m reading an anthology, I\u2019m looking for short stories. They don\u2019t have to be 5 pages, I\u2019m not that wimpy, but Boyett\u2019s story is 64 pages and that is overkill. Another story was over 40, while still one more topped 50 pages. In a really good anthology, I can deal with one novella, but three stories of that length just kills my motivation to keep reading on a daily basis.And really, length is my only gripe with this one. All of the authors involved are recognizable names in the horror field, and these stories show why that is. None of the stories felt cobbled together just because there was a zombie anthology looking for stories, and none of them felt as if they were pre-existing stories with a little editing done in post to turn them into zombie stories, even though for all I know this was exactly the case in at least one or two instances. If it was, the authors hid it well.If BOOK OF THE DEAD is the precursor, the one that got the ball rolling on the whole zombie fiction phenomenon, I\u2019m not surprised so many hopefuls took up the mantle in an effort to produce something as original or interesting. Naturally, I wish those that followed had all been as talented as this group, but you can\u2019t have everything, right?While it took the longest of all the zombie books I\u2019ve read recently to work through, in the end BOOK OF THE DEAD was the one that was most worth the effort. Pay attention to this table of contents, folks. There\u2019s a reason these people are stars."}, {"userName": "Kynthos-the-Archer (Kyn)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9739117-kynthos-the-archer-kyn", "userReview": "Scary-shit.

I know that zombies aren't proper Christmas undead (ghosts are - just ask Charles Dickens), but what the hell?To be honest, I couldn't remember all of the stories, so I pulled the contents from Wikipedia and will make a note of what I remember about each of them. Like a lot of fiction from this genre, some were really good, but most weren't - and an attempt at social commentary was usually the deciding factor in either case.CoverI have to address the cover of this book: it's stupid. I know you can't judge a book by its cover, but I mean, really, it looks like a book about witchcraft, or ghosts, or demonic possession. I have no idea who picked the artwork, but he or she should be subjected to one of the gruesome endings that the characters within the book eventually meet!Foreword by George A. RomeroSupposedly, all of the stories in the book were either set in George Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" universe or were deeply inspired by it. I have no idea what George actually said in the forward, but I am sure sure it was a humble recognition of his own stature as the father of the genre. God bless you, George, you sick fuck!Introduction: On Going Too Far, or Flesh Eating Zombies: New Hope for the Future\" by Skipp and SpectorI have no idea what these guys had to say either; unlike Romero's forward, I probably didn't even read it, actually.\"Blossom\" by Chan McConnell (pseudonym for David J. Schow)This was the story of a man and his undead whore. She didn't start out that way, but apparently she didn't manage to say the safe word before choking to death on her own vomit, then tearing her jon's penis off with her zombie vagina.No, I'm not kidding.I didn't really care for this story, and the author has no one but himself to blame because when he went for subtlety instead of shock, his writing wasn't half bad. The last page of the story describes shocked hotel employees who had seen a good-looking, up-scale call girl (I like to think of Julie Roberts in \"Pretty Woman\") go into a room, and witness a blood-spattered undead corpse, bloated from consuming its patron come out. My advice: read the first and last pages of this story, and go rent \"Teeth\" rather than read the crap in between.\"Mess Hall\" by Richard LaymonI think this story is about a woman who is abducted by a serial killer, raped, and murdered who then reanimates and exacts revenge on her killer.Zombie short fiction writers seem to have a think for castration and penis mutilation - I'm almost positive the undead avenger (avengerette?) has enough wits about her that she deliberately bites her assailant's weenie off first, then his testicles, and actually savors his suffering for a bit before finishing him off.\"It Helps If You Sing\" by Ramsey CampbellSomething about Haitian voodoo and social commentary on Christian fundamentalism.Yawn.Next.\"Home Delivery\" by Stephen KingI have a love-hate relationship with Stephen King. I think as a whole the body of his work is overrated, and I'll be damned why it seems to be that his best books are awful movies.But I digress.\"Home Delivery\" may or may not be an attempt to explain what the Venus probe referenced in Romero's original \"Night of the Living Dead\" encountered on its way back to Earth. Whether it is or it isn't, the zombie plague is apparently an extra-terrestrial (un)life form that the press has dubbed \"Star Wormwood.\" And the worm-like things from said star infest living beings and turn them into zombies.\"Home Delivery\" is about a simpleton woman living alone on an island who, it is revealed, cleaved her zombiefied husband in two with an axe and threw his remains down the well.To be honest, I wish the story had been about the ill-fated astronauts who attempted to rendezvous with Star Wormwood.\"Wet Work\" by Phillip NutmanWhat if Jason Bourne was a zombie, but smart like Bub in \"Day of the Dead?\"What if he were even smarter, and pissed off at \"the establishment?\"And \"the establishment\" was also a bunch of zombies.That's pretty much this story.\"A Sad Last Love at the Diner of the Damned\" by Edward BryantRemember when I said that zombie fiction writers have a thing about genital mutilation? Well, it happens again in this story. There is a particularly graphic passage about what happens when you grab a man by his junk and disembowel him by jerking up really hard.Props to the author. It's hard to have an over-the-top gross-out scene in a zombie story that doesn't involve necrophilia, and this story has it.Oh, and it also has some necrophilia, too. Yuck...\"Bodies and Heads\" by Steve Rasnic TemI have no idea what the hell this story was doing in the book. It really didn't have anything to do with zombies, Romero-esque or otherwise.All around the world people are shaking their heads violently for no apparent reason. If you ask them why they're unresponsive. If you grab them by their head, then their body twists beneath them.Eventually, everyone's' heads come off, and it turns out that their abdomens have mutated into giant maws that eat them.The only thing missing from this story was someone's belly button moaning \"brains...!\"This story really made me said, because I realized it had consumed twenty minutes of my life I would never be able to get back...\"Choices\" by Glen VaseyFor the life of me, I cannot remember what this story was about.\"The Good Parts\" by Les Daniels Zombies dig porn! Zombies will act out the things they see in porn with each other! Incredibly, zombies breed healthy, cherubic little human babies and don't eat them, but feed them strained peas and carrots until their human offspring are mature enough to reanact porn on their own, thus perpetuating the cycle of living and undead sex.Les Daniels clearly needs to get laid, though I have to give him credit - the zombie birthing process made me laugh out loud and slightly nauseated all at the same time.\"Less Than Zombie\" by Douglas E. WinterWhat if \"Less Than Zero\" had been a zombie movie?Yeah, I still wouldn't have liked it much then, either.\"Like Pavlov's Dogs\" by Steven R. BoyettMy favorite story of the bunch, \"Like Pavlov's Dogs\" is set primarily in a biosphere whose inhabitants survive the zombie apocalypse unscathed. Much like the biker gang in the original \"Dawn of the Dead,\" this story teaches us that even in a world of ravenous, shambling corpses we have far more to fear from the living than the dead.\"Saxophone\" by Nicholas RoyleNope. I can't recall this story, either.\"On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert With Dead Folks\" by Joe R. LansdaleLots and lots of necrophilia and post-zombie-apocalypse depravity on the part of the surviving human beings.If you've ever wondered how you might go about staffing a brothel with zombie whores (I know I have!), the answer involves wiring their mouths shut and amputating their hands. However, if you get hold of a freshly dead hottie (again, I'm looking at you, Julie Roberts) and bolt the right electronic components to her noggin, you don't have to resort to dismemberment to enjoy her company, though you will have to work harder at getting into her pants.If you think my summary was painful to read, you should try the actual story. Joe R. Lansdale, shame on you!\"Dead Giveaway\" by Brian HodgeZombies like late morning television, specifically \"The Price is Right.\" A composite Wink Martindale/Chuck Woolery/Richard Dawson gives away fabulous living prizes to undead contestants under the watchful eye of his undead boss, who is all about the ratings.I hear Brian Hodge is working on a sequel for sweeps week.No, not really...\"Jerry's Kids Meet Wormboy\" by David J. SchowAnother \"the living are more dangerous than the living dead\" parable. The titular Wormboy is a stereotypical geek (fat, unhygienic, antisocial - probably plays Dungeons & Dragons) who indulges in cannibalism before the zombie apocalypse hits, so has no trouble fitting right in afterward.Pound for pound, this is the grossest story in the book. At the same time, it probably has given hope to dozens of lonely, obese, cannibalistic teens who are just waiting for the zombie apocalypse so they can have someone to relate to...\"Eat Me\" by Robert R. McCammon Not McCammon's finest work (\"Night Boat,\" which he oddly refuses to allow to be republished was an awesome zombie story).\"Eat Me\" answers the eternal question: in a world populated entirely by the living dead, can two people experience true intimacy?The answer, of course, is \"yes\" and - unsurprisingly - involves genital mutilation.Why do I give this book four stars? Well, for starters, it was a zombie anthology long before zombie anthologies were cool. Props for that.Secondly, it attempted to do for Romero's work what fanzines did for \"Star Trek\" during the 1970s and into the 1980s before the franchise was expanded and eventually bastardized beyond recognition. And just like some of the early published \"Star Trek\" stories were complete shit (cough... Sondra Marshak and Myrna Culbreath... cough), we the fans were forgiving because we love the genre.Thirdly, I really don't think that the current zombie-mania would have happened if it weren't for respected horror writers contributing to \"Book of the Dead.\" I just hope (now that I've ordered four new zombie anthologies) that what follows is better than what came before.And lastly, Goodreads doesn't allow you to give three-and-a-half-stars."}, {"userName": "John Reppion", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1676481-john-reppion", "userReview": "Right from the start Book of the Dead\u2019s credentials are impressive. Published in 1989, the anthology boasts a foreword from George A. Romero and features sixteen short stories, supposedly set in the aftermath of the same zombie plague seen in his original Dead trilogy (although it\u2019s debatable whether anyone actually stuck to that brief properly). With authors such as Steven King, Joe R, Lansdale, Ramsey Campbell and Richard Laymon contributing tales, this is an A-list affair, especially given that many of the featured writers were at the peak of their popularity at the time the book was first published.Following Romero\u2019s foreword, Skipp & Spector\u2019s introduction entitled \u201cOn Going Too Far\u201d sets the agenda for the book and it\u2019s a schema enchantingly rooted in its era of origin. Talking about Tipper Gore\u2019s crusade against violence in film, desensitization at the hands of video nasties, \u201can era of serial killers, Khmer Rouge, drive-by shooters and day-care rapists, hijackings and knee-cappings, death squads and body dumps\u201d, it\u2019s like a rough cut flashback to the nihilistic nineteen-eighties, recorded on fourth generation pirate VHS tape. It\u2019s a trip down memory lane to the bad old days when mutually assured destruction had many dreaming of a nuclear winter rather than a white Christmas, Mrs. Thatcher and Cowboy Ronnie sending out cards from their private underground bunkers. Truth be told, watching a Police Academy marathon, listening to Culture Club on a Sony Walkman, wearing roller boots, a Mr. T t-shirt and Deelie-Boppers whilst trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube and drinking Cherry Coke could not even come close to being as authentically eighties as this intro is. But alas, the fact that Book of the Dead was so culturally spot on when it was first published actually meant that some parts of the collection didn\u2019t quite work for me as a reader nearly twenty years later.Anthologies by their very nature are a mixed bag and Book of the Dead is no exception. There are some really enjoyable tales in the book: Steven King\u2019s Home Delivery, a gloriously gory EC comic book in short story form, somehow packs more plot into twenty seven pages than many people (King included) usually manage to squeeze into a hundred. Joe R. Lansdale\u2019s On The Far Side Of The Cadillac Desert With Dead Folks is a true to form bad taste B-Movie romp effortlessly executed. Ramsey Campbell\u2019s It Helps If You Sing, the only story set in Britain so far as I can make out, is a vision of a claustrophobic, grey-concreted place, and brought to mind Anthony Burgess\u2019s vision of a near future Albion from A Clockwork Orange. Campbell goes for discomfort and creeping menace, perhaps deliberately avoiding the no holds barred splatter which drips off the surrounding pages and I think it really pays off.Then there are the bad parts and these are more general, more to do with the book as a whole and the way things sort of add up from story to story. I\u2019m a little freaked out to realise that I really haven\u2019t read much modern horror; I\u2019m just getting into Joe Hill and I enjoy Max Brooks\u2019 writing, of course, but there\u2019s not really anyone writing horror at the moment whose books I feel I have to get hold of as soon as they appear. When I was first getting into horror in the early nineties James Herbert was the author whose work I was truly hungry for and raced through as fast as I could. Returning to his work years later I was actually quite shocked and disappointed by some of the material in there, especially when it came to sex. Book of the Dead suffers from the same problem; it\u2019s gratuitously littered with sex and rape for no real reason that I can make out. Of the sixteen stories in the book more than half of them feature the loss of at least one penis, which is both tragic and hilarious; these \u2018masters of horror\u2019 being asked to contribute to an anthology and all handing in stories that feature what is obviously the worse thing they can imagine. \u201cAh man, imagine if you lost your dick! That would suck!\u201d The general attitude to women is pretty dodgy for the most part too but the thing that bugged me the most was the sense of apathy that pervades much of the book. Douglas E. Winter\u2019s Less Than Zombie, supposedly a parody of Brett Easton Ellis\u2019 1985 novel Less Than Zero but which reads more like a mere appropriation of Ellis\u2019 style with a zombie or two (barely) crow-barred in, is perhaps the worst offender. There\u2019s this underlying sense that the zombie plague is an inevitable thing; just another fucked up part of fucked up life in the fucked up eighties. Culturally and historically interesting though that may be, in terms of horror storytelling it often doesn\u2019t really work. For me, there needs to be an \u2018us\u2019 and a \u2018them\u2019, even if those roles are swapped and re-swapped during the course of a story. Once an author starts saying \u201cdoes any of it really matter?\u201d and there\u2019s no one in the story prepared to stand up and say \u201cyes\u201d, the whole thing becomes rather futile. Is there any point in reading a horror story where you\u2019re not supposed to care who lives and who dies? Sometimes maybe, but you\u2019d have to be a masterful author to pull it off.All of that said, I really enjoyed the book generally. A real stand out story for me was Choices by Glen Vasey, whose work I have never encountered before. It\u2019s an intelligent, thoughtful piece telling the tale of a traumatised traveller, forever alone even when his journey brings him into contact with others. Choices manages to capture the right atmosphere and achieve a real sense of balance; lots of humanity, lots of pathos but still plenty of horror and action. Overall, Book of the Dead is a very enjoyable and important anthology, though you may have to take certain stories with a pinch of salt. Certainly it is well worth tracking down if you haven\u2019t done so already and the paperback edition is still pretty easy to get hold of."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6997740-margaret", "userReview": "This book belonged to my uncle (not sure if he still has it)and I remember reading this when I was about 12. \"A Sad Last Love At The Diner Of The Damned\" naturally got my attention by the title, alone.

It seems to me that many of the stories have been reprinted elsewhere, so perhaps there are now legal issues surrounding that?Inner workings of the publishing industry aside, this is one hell of a book. Heavy hitters like Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell, Robert McCammon (back when he still got his hands dirty writing horror), and Joe Lansdale serve up some really good reanimated corpse tales. Douglas Winter's \"Less Than Zombie\" is a hilarious Brett Easton Ellis parody that brings zombies and bored rich kids together in a very splatter-ific story. And that's the thing. The emphasis here is on splatter, which is not wholly surprising given that splatterpunk was still being hailed as the next big thing back when this book was published. I'd argue that not all zombie lit need be splatter oriented. Even Romero's Day of the Dead--when stripped of a few gory set pieces--had a heavy philosophical bent. Most of these stories just go for the throat, not necessarily a bad thing, just a little monotonous.Now that there are a million zombie anthologies out there, you could do worse than this one."}, {"userName": "Ricky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8299424-ricky", "userReview": "A good friend of mine recommended this book to me, said it was age old, and the copy I bought looks as though it's been around since the dawn of time.
