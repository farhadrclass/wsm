Fearing for the safety of her children, she makes a desperate trek to England where the rest of her family has successfully found asylum. Fereiba's family will meet many challenges along the way.. will they make it to England?Saleem, Fereiba\u2019s son, feels the need to become the man of the family and protect his mother and siblings from imminent danger. On this dangerous and desperate quest to England, Fereiba\u2019s family begins to run out of funds and options. In an attempt to solve this problem, Saleem separates from his family. Saleem did not know that this separation would be the last time he would see his family for a long, long time..This book tackles some hot button issues that are prevalent right now. Especially with what is happening in the White House and the Trump administration. I found it absolutely invigorating and intellectually stimulating on many levels. Human trafficking, immigration, and refugee camps are just some of the issues that were the foci of this book. This book shattered my soul. It was brilliant. Nadia Hashimi writes with a deft hand and effortless prose. She is a pediatrician in Washington, D.C. and she is running for congress. This woman is unstoppable! I have already read two of her books, and I am absolutely going to be reading her third.

Missing a right leg, a left hand, a child, or a mother. Everyone was missing something, as if a black hole had opened in the center of the country, sucking in bits and pieces of everyone into its hard belly. Somewhere under our khaki earth is everything we\u2019ve ever lost.\u201d \u2014Fereiba WaziriIndiebound.org put Hashimi on my radar, and while I knew that her books were about the Middle East, I didn\u2019t really know much about them. I started reading When the Moon is Low on a whim because it passed my first sentence rule, a tactic I employ when I\u2019m exceedingly listless and can\u2019t decide on what to read next. The first line was pretty compelling. I was intrigued.\u201cI am no longer a new bride or a young woman. I am a mother, farther from Kabul than I have ever been. My children and I have crossed mountains, deserts, and oceans to reach this dank hotel room, utterly unsophisticated and unfragrant.\u201dWhen the Moon is Low is the story of an Afghani family that is forced to leave their homeland when the violence and madness of a new regime put the family welfare in jeopardy. Now among the countless refugees seeking asylum in sympathetic European countries, Hashimi splits the narrative between Fereiba, the matriarch of the family, and Saleem, the eldest son. Hashimi is a poet; I underlined countless beautiful passages that made me contemplate my own situation, and how our comfortable lives can change at the drop of a dime.What did confuse me was the objective of the book, which caused me to wonder: where is this going? Is this a story about getting out of Afghanistan and how wonderful things were before madness ensued, or is it about a journey to find safety? The author\u2019s afterword tied everything in, and more than made up for the ambiguous ending (which FYI many people hated but I did not because it was reality). I leave you with her parting words. I cannot stress enough how timely this book is. Definitely not perfect, but a must-read for our day in time.\n\u201cThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that roughly half of all refugees are under the age of eighteen. Alarmingly, the crisis has continued to grow while the world\u2019s sympathies have ebbed and flowed. We cry when we see a photograph of three-year-old Alan Kurdi\u2019s lifeless body, his family\u2019s hopes for a new life taken by the rough waters they were trying to cross to safety. We make dinner while the news anchor reports another fifty men, women, and children were lost in the Mediterranean to a capsized boat. We change the channel, afraid our first grader\u2019s innocence will be spoiled by graphic images. We breathe a sigh of relief when pictures of rescue volunteers handing out warm blankets appear on our Facebook scroll. Our minds are on work deadlines while NPR reports on the violence in Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia that continues to drive desperate people to risk their lives. It feels hopeless. It feels like this is no longer \u2018news.\u2019 At some point, the ongoing desperation of millions has become background noise.\u201d\u2014Nadia Hashimi"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "Another heart wrenching novel from Hashimi. I've not read a book that has explored so closely the flight of individuals from war torn countries. Really startling how emotionally and physically difficult this is for them to do... first, they have to leave their beloved homes behind then they have to endure disdain from the countries they are fleeing to. Very, very sad... yet another harrowing example of the strength of the human spirit. I didn't feel as connected to these characters as in The Pearl That Broke Its Shell, but still a very emotionally riveting novel."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630646-carole", "userReview": "Nadia Hashimi is a very gifted writer. I loved her first novel, The Pearl That Broke It's Shell.This is a story of a brave young mother, who flees her home in Afganistan with her 3 children after her husband is killed. The story is told from her point of view, and her son, Saleem's. As I sit comfortably in my safe, American home, my heart breaks for Mothers in the world who want better lives and oppurtunities for their children, and are willing to do anything for the chance. That road is unbelievably hard, and scary. Living on the streets with no food, no medicine, cold, afraid, and not knowing who to trust, is one I cannot imagine. Hope is found however, and the kindness of strangers, aid them in their journey. If you have read any of Khaled Hossani's books and enjoyed them, I think you'll like Nadia Hashimi's as well. I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20625013-liz", "userReview": "There is so much that I wanted to say about this book but I will try to stay on point and be brief. Sort of.This is the first I\u2019ve read of Nadia Hashimi and I found it to be simply but elegantly written. In certain places the emotion leaps right off the page and manages to pack a bigger a punch with fewer words. Descriptions of countries and living conditions are succinct and clear. I find this to be more a more engaging style for me than something with long, flowery prose or extensive descriptions of the landscape. This story is about a woman who is fleeing Afghanistan with her three children, trying to escape the war-torn country and the inhumane rule of the Taliban. Hashimi gives us an eye-opening view into the lives of this family, once happy, turned refugee. The picture she paints is not one of nameless refugees but real human beings who are no different than the rest of us except that their home suddenly became their prison under the threat of death. Families broken apart. Lives turned upside down. Nowhere else to go. Sadly, they are often treated no better than vermin in the countries where they seek refuge.I can\u2019t help but feel that this book came to me at a significant time when there is currently so much debate over the how the U.S. and rest of the world should \u201cdeal with these Syrian refugees.\u201d To me, it\u2019s not complicated. They need our help. Period. I enjoyed this book and I learned from it. I\u2019ll be looking for more from this author and more books on this subject."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758987-becky", "userReview": "Truly a 4.5 stars. What a current & relevant story this is. There are so many opinions on anything to do with refugees & immigrants ( illlegal or not), whether it is here in the US & closing our borders or in many other foreign countries where people are fleeing for many reasons- war, poverty, religious freedom, etc.This story starts with a young Afghan girl, named Ferebia. We follow her life as a young girl & teenager into her married life. She & her husband are educated, professional people but times have changed & their lives in Kabul take a dramatic turn.The rest of the book focuses on the journey a family must make to stay alive, to be fed, to be safe. At times I had to stop & think- what would I have done, what would I have done for my children & our safety. This is just one of many refugee/immigrant stories out there & even though this was a tale of fiction, I am sure we could find many true, compelling stories each & every day.....I would highly recommend this book. Very moving."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4186821-nancy", "userReview": "Ahh.....I was so very enjoying reading this book and was ready for a five star rating....until the end. I am a person that needs beginnings and endings to my stories. I don't want to create my own version of an ending and I don't like sequels.

I wasn't moved or touched. I felt that a distance remained for me as a reader and I didn't want that remoteness.The book had too many tropes. The mean stepmother and the evil Taliban figured prominently. But thank goodness for the kindly neighbors and the few compassionate figures along the way. They included the kind man and his wife who took in the lodgers, the caring, pretty aid worker, the cocky Afghani male compatriots, etc.The story is intriguing and picks up especially once the family escapes from Afghanistan. And I think the most wrenching pieces are the based-on-reality depictions of fleeing refugees and migrants trying to survive in Turkey, Greece, Italy, France, etc. They are en route or stuck, scratching out an existence as their initial dreams of a better life fade.I must add here that the repeated or common themes specific to Afghanistan's recent history may be due to my reading too much (if that's possible) about the country. Those stories must be told, I feel, but I struggle with how to view them after a certain point."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "This is once again a soulfoul book. The first part of the book in Afghanistan read like The Pearl That Broke Its Shell - the debut novel of this author. Absolutely brilliant. Pearl was one of the best books I have ever read. When I started out with this book I got hyper excited again. The quality of writing was just phenominal. When the Moon is Low lost me around two thirds into the book. The magic was lost. Too much emotional extortion, a weak predictable plot and a change to a cramped memoir of a journey from Afghanistan to England. The ending was left to the reader's imagination, which is exciting, but sometimes bland. It is quite clear that the intention was to document this family's unimaginable journey and introduce the plight of refugees to the outside world. A documentary in novel form. Nevertheless, the rich cultural experience for the reader made up for anything else that bothered me. The vulnerability of Fereiba Waziri and her children was heartwrenching. I got lost in the poetic prose in motion. The atmosphere gripped me.The last third of the book changed into something else. I want to rate this book 3.5 stars, but will go for 4. Nadia Hashimi is a fantastic author with a talent for music in her prose. Quotes from the book:\"Fereiba-jan. In the darkness, when you cannot see the ground under your feet and when your fingers touch nothing but night, you are not alone. I will stay with you as moonlight stays on water.\u201d\u201cEven your brother has found his way, without obligation to anyone. I do not know who is to blame. He has the body of a horse but the mind of an ass.\u201dKokoGul\u2019s heart was a fixed space, a container with finite dimensions, and every inch of it had been spoken for by my sisters and my father. I stared at her and through her. Once again and even more unexpectedly this time, I was motherless.Fereiba: I imagined my home without me\u2014my sisters laughing in the hallways, my brother at my father\u2019s side, and KokoGul, hands on her hips, proudly presiding over it all. Why did my mother have to die? Nothing exceptional happened on this afternoon. It was a few words, not much different from any other day but it was a private, cataclysmic moment when I saw the woman before me through unclouded eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re coming back sooner than I expected,\u201d KokoGul said, thinking out loud. \u201cBut I\u2019ll find a way to keep them baited.\u201d KokoGul made her own mouth water. I saw the peaks of a hundred mountains rising before me.Mother. All my life I had called KokoGul by this radiant and hopeful name, wishing for the touch of lamb\u2019s wool on my cheek and too often getting nothing but a cool draft.History has so many tales to tell. This one should be heard. And Nadia Hashimi should keep on writing. Historical fiction is her fort\u00e9, I would say."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2880730-debbie", "userReview": "Two sad, moving books back to back for me was almost too much.The subject of immigrants is such a hot bed right now here in our country.

So much in this book touched my heart.Ferebia when thru so much - from her birth to the point she flees with her children. Saleem had to grow up so quickly and deal with things no child should have to deal with.A great book!"}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica", "userReview": "I give this three weak and and flimsy stars. It could easily have been two.Typically, my privilege and I love stories about people who endure immense suffering and come out better in the end. I know why I like these tales, I know it makes me a horrible person but also a normal person. I'm sure not loving this book also makes me a horrible person but, in this case, not a normal person.I've shelved this story under YA because it pulls its punches, like it's made for the delicate sensibilities of fragile not-yet-adult readers. Horrors and atrocities are not voiced but are, instead, glossed-over or are examined in hindsight. The feelings I should have felt were conspicuously absent or perhaps they were being carefully spared. I never felt involved with the characters, rather, I was annoyed with Fereiba and her neverending mother obsession. Her mother died giving birth to her and her stepmother wasn\u2019t affectionate. She loved her mother-in-law and was bitter when the woman died because the mother she\u2019d just finally found was taken away. She became a mother, herself, and that made her miss her unknown mother and her mother-in-law even more. Mothers, mothers, mothers. Fereiba knows mothers!With all that had happened in her life, why was that what defined her? Why was she never able to put that to rest, not even at the end where she's shown putting it to rest?Then there's her son, Saleem. What a good, upstanding, perfect human being. The mistakes he makes are made with the strongest ethical reasoning. He's the pinnacle of humanity and that is why he is able to survive all the hardships. Except, no. He's refugee-survivor and more hopping from safehaven to safehaven out of sheer good luck. And those safehavens! Those people who rescued and helped him along the way, the family in Turkey, the aid worker in Greece, his contemporaries in the camps, Mimi the prostitute, they all exist to further his story. They're not interesting in and of themselves, they're only there so Saleem can hop to another sound rock in the stream where he can make deep and soulful judgements about people and move on from them never to look back.I felt like I was reading a book that wanted to be adapted into a movie, like it was just waiting for the right actors to give these characters life and depth, something they lack in the book.And that's a shame because I should have found this to be a powerful and moving story of a displaced Afghan family fleeing their country in the hope of finding a better life."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963725-terri", "userReview": "Review also found at http://kristineandterri.blogspot.ca/2...**I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher William Morrow via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. The expected publication date is July 21st 2015** I was pretty excited for this read. I had read Hashimi's previous novel The Pearl That Broke it's Shell (review here ) and loved it so my expectations were set high for this book. I can say I was not disappointed. I won't re-hash the story as I feel the book synopsis does a good job describing the plot. As Hashimi's previous novel did, this story educated me more about a region that I honestly know little about. I am going to assume that some of the background information is historically accurate. I did not know that women in Afghanistan used to have the same liberties as I currently know. I had assumed that it had always been the way we know if now where woman are not treated as equal. When Fereiba described her outfit of a pencil skirt I was initially confused until the story described the transition of the Afghanistan of old to the new one. I am not sure why stories that take place in this geography fascinate me so much. Maybe it is because it is so different from what I know, or maybe because it is almost always tragic, I don't know. I am really not going to analyze it to much.  Back to the plot...a little bit. I could not even imagine going through what this family went through in order to try to escape their reality. Does it ever put things in to perspective when I am sweating the small stuff. My reality is a dream compared to theirs. I encourage anyone who likes to read about the plight of people in real places to pick up this book. Both books actually. They are eye opening, compelling, well written and simply entertaining. I look forward to discovering any future work by Hashimi. In closing I have to say that I felt the ending to the story was completely appropriate. Symbolic in a way. For anyone who has read this I would love to know if you agree."}, {"userName": "Jenny (adultishbooks)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3772692-jenny-adultishbooks", "userReview": "This book has a really high rating on Goodreads so I think a couple things factor into my rating.1) I could be full of shit2) I may be in a really bad reading slump3) This is not a good book to split up and put down for days and sometimes months at a time.Still that ending...really?!"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10079019-carol", "userReview": "Again Nadia Hashimi drew me into the life of her characters portrayed in When The Moon is Low.

The plight of refugees has been highlighted in the last few decades by many countries, volunteers, and charitable organizations. We have a fair amount in the area where I live, so I felt that this story was definitely current. I liked the characters in this. A family was caught in a sad little story trying to escape Kabul after the death of the husband by the government. I liked too, that even though there was a lot of tragedy here, it didn't feel like a tragedy parade. There were glimpses of kindness evenly placed throughout. I applaud that. Two things kept this review from reaching 4 stars. The first one was the beginning. Here the MC is a young teen, jilted by a neighbor and the next thing, she is married with kids. I'm not sure the beginning really added anything for me, but it was a sweet story. It felt like a labor of love for the author. The second thing, which kind of includes the first one, is that it didn't feel as cohesive as I like. There was a lot going on, and with the different POVs and all the characters, it felt all over the place.

There are so many articles, opinions, thoughts, and social media propaganda discussing the refugee crisis that this book, though fictional, was a timely reminder that each refugee has a story. I don't know the details for what brings each person to the shores of a foreign nation seeking asylum, it could be tragic, motivated by religion, or simply seeking a better life than what could be attained in a native land. My opinions are not changed and this is not a political book review- I don't have the answers and I certainly know reading a fictional book will not provide answers. All I do know, is that this beautiful book gave me a pause to think before I respond. Which I think would benefit many folks in this age of freely sharing opinions in the comfort of anonymity. This book allowed me to identify with a mother who has children and a life that was taken away from her through no fault of her own. Bad things happen to good people.

the masses of people all over the world in search of a place to call home. It is a fictional story, meant only to represent the dilemma of the displaced in a small way. There are many out there documenting true human experiences, and I am grateful for the critical work they do. What do I wish for? Since I'm one part dreamer and two parts realist, I wish for a world that doesn't create refugees, but until then, I'll settle for the humanity in each of us that makes sharing and hearing these important stories possible."}, {"userName": "Tania", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania", "userReview": "3.5 stars. This book would have rated much higher if I enjoyed the first third more, but unfortunately Fereiba's coming of age section read very much like another version of the Cinderella story. The rest of the book more than makes up for this though. This is not the first book I've read about refugees, but it's definitely the one that had the biggest impact. The author does an amazing job showing the desperation of this situation. Not only do we get to see how it impacts the life of a mother, and her young son, but she also weaves in many minor characters stories. It felt incredibly real, and my heart goes out to anyone in this situation. I listened to this on audio, and I'm sure my rating would have been higher if I read it, not because there was anything wrong with the narrators but because I always immerse myself more when reading, and this is the type of book you need to feel."}, {"userName": "Kenchiin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41280039-kenchiin", "userReview": "The fact that the story has been split in two absurdly different parts doesn't really help.

The father, Mahmood, had delayed their leaving Afghanistan; later we find out why. After he has been taken away and killed, Fereiba, and her three children decide to flee with false papers. The novel recounts their journey to freedom in England and her stepsister. Fereiba's narration read like a memoir, which I at first thought it was, until the first section concerning the lonely trek of her oldest son, Saleem. He has become separated from the family in Greece. To me the events rang true to life: something that might encapsulate the DP experience. Does Saleem cross successfully to England?

She knows that she has to do whatever she can to keep her family safe, and sets out to leave their Afghanistan home and travel to England where her sister is. It is a difficult journey and the small family meet tragedy and heartache all along the way.  I found \"When The Moon Is Low\" to be a fascinating but heart-wrenching story. Author Nadia Hashimi's storytelling is exquisite as she weaves the story using the voices of Fereiba and her son, Saleem. It was interesting to see the journey Fereiba's family takes through the eyes of the mother and of the son. This is a powerfully emotional story and I found myself tearing up at the most difficult situations, and cheering Fereiba's bravery as she always pushes forward for her family. This novel is a brilliant look into the other side of Afghanistan and the people of the country who have suffered so much for so long. I highly recommend this book to those interested in learning more about our world."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "If I could give this book to every person who has hateful internet posts regarding refugees, perhaps their hearts might start to feel.

Despite a difficult childhood, Fereiba is finally happy. When the Taliban rise to power, however, her world comes to an abrupt halt. She can no longer teach as more rules are imposed each day. Matters only worsen when her husband is taken from their lives and she has to flee Afghanistan with her children. Facing a long and dangerous journey, Fereiba must rely on the kindness of strangers and her instincts to save her family.This is my second novel by Hashimi. I read The Pearl That Broke Its Shell last year and was amazed. This novel was no different in that regard. The thematic is similar but the storyline different. Told by Fereiba and later, her son, Saleem, we follow their journey out of Afghanistan to England. This is the type of novel that makes me appreciate all the blessings in my life. Hashimi is a talented writer, her prose captivating. Parts of the novel are heartbreaking as Fereiba struggles to keep her family safe and whole while the world seems to be against them. Yet,what stands out is her resilience and the love she has for her children. Hashimi offers us a glimpse into the life of a refugee, a situation that is currently a hot button issue. The bottom line is that everyone just wants to be and feel safe. A great book. There is a third to be published later this year and I look forward reading it."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3052382-hannah", "userReview": "I was so impressed with Nadia Hashimi's first book, The Pearl that Broke Its Shell, that I recommended it to my book club and just about every friend I know who reads. This book, When the Moon is Low, will be another that gets recommended (and likely read by my book club as well). Hashimi is Afghan-American and writes about Afghanistan during different time periods, from Afghanistan's heyday, to rise of the Taliban, and into modern times. She writes beautifully, poetically, but the best thing about her writing is her characters. She creates characters that make you fall in love with them, make you empathize with them, feel happy in their triumphs and sadness in their losses. Afghanistan has a tumultuous history and Hashimi's characters experience both the highs and lows and they take you along with them. This latest book follow Fereiba and, later, her child, Saleem as they fight to leave Afghanistan for England after the Taliban take control of Kabul. I cannot say enough about this author and her writing. Very much worth reading, even if you don't know much about Afghanistan or its' history."}, {"userName": "Vicki Willis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32195771-vicki-willis", "userReview": "This book was about a family forced to flee their war torn country. The danger both physical and emotional definitely took it toll. I did feel that it was like two stories. The first one being the life of a girl growing up in Afghanistan. It was very interesting from a historical perspective, but also a slow meandering story. The second part was about this girl all grown up with a family of her own and their efforts to flee to a safer home. There was a connection later in the book that brought the parts together. The ending was satisfying, but was a little sudden considering how slow the story developed and there was one line that made me stop and say, \"What?\" and I had to go back and listen (I was on audible) to it again to make sure I understood what just happened. I thought it was a good book and would recommend it to anyone who likes current historical fiction."}], "description": "Mahmoud's passion for his wife Fereiba, a schoolteacher, is greater than any love she's ever known.
