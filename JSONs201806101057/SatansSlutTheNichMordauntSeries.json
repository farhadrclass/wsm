Nich Mordaunt is a pagan intent on bringing back ancient religion to the British Isles. His antithesis is Tom Pridough, a priest of a yet undisclosed Christian sect. Mordaunt is vocal and a known in the community, and Pridough blames all \"wrong-doings\" on him and his followers. When Mordaunt decides to hold a Black Mass with the help of a local dominatrix, recently defrocked priest, and a local gangster things start getting out of hand for the young pagan.From a religious standpoint, this reminds me a lot of The Mists of Avalon, likely a book author Aishling Morgan is well familiar. There is some interesting discussion or how Christianity in Britain took over the Celto-Pagan practices of old, but also of how the Celts took over even older religions. It tends to be very smart about the topic, though I will not swear to the authenticity of all the claims made. From a fiction aspect, the story builds quite nicely, and could easily be quite an interesting bit of pulp for a wider audience were not the sex so graphic. The characters are interesting and well formed. Many of their abnormal desires* are discussed more deeply than you might expect, and in an almost moralistic fashion they bring the characters into the hands of some unsavory types.* Please note my use of \"abnormal desires\" is meant to indicate practices that might shock those of a more Puritan nature. I do not judge.So, obviously this book is not for everyone, but if you have an interest in erotica, paganism (or more-so Satanism), this is a fairly compelling book give a try. I have finally reached the [ahem] climax of the story, and things look to be changing drastically. I think the last 10% of it will hold some surprises. I will mention, however, that I am rarely thrilled by Morgan's endings. She does a nice job up until the last few pages. I am, however, rarely impressed my endings in book or film, so maybe it is just me?"}], "description": "Someone has been performing the Black Mass in an old, abandoned chapel at Stanton Rocks. The local priest, Tom Pridough, is convinced it was Nick Mordaunt, local high-profile pagan, and his friend, the stunning brunette Juliana. Tired of the churchman's confusion of diabolism with his own nature-worship, Nick too sets out to find out who is responsible, and all three become embroiled in a weird and perverse world of sex-magic beyond their darkest imagination.Part of the Nick Mordaunt series: fantastic fetish erotica featuring occultist Nick Mordaunt.
