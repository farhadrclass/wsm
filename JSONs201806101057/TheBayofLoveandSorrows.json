Michael and his new friends, Madonna and her brother Silver, are looking for some excitement during the summer of 1974 in a rural New Brunswick town. The charismatic ex-con Everette Hutch manipulates the group of young people into helping him with a big drug deal. One bad decision leads to larger unwise decisions, and eventually to some tragic consequences. It reaches the point where Michael and each of his friends cannot find their way out of the mess, and innocent people are hurt. Madonna and Silver are trapped by poverty as well as by the violent Everette. \"He was the swirling centre, the black hole where all the debris, the planets and moons, like Madonna and Silver and Michael Skid, teetered and wobbled in their orbits, and were being sucked into. And this is exactly what all of them had sensed from the moment they had met him thirteen months before.\"The author was very skillful at weaving a web around the characters where there is no way to escape unscathed. I admired the plotting, and felt the book gave a good sense of place in the small Canadian town. The story is very grim, with many unlikable low-life characters, so it would probably not appeal to some readers.3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Rosa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/244629-rosa", "userReview": "I found this book in a second hand book store this past summer. I had read another of this author's books and knew it would be a good one. I was not disappointed. This author writes simply but with such feeling about characters who are so real. Both of the books I've read take place in New Brunswick in smaller rural communities where the lives of the characters are tightly woven. This one takes place during the of summer 1974. A group of unlikely young people are linked together because of tragic event. The plot thickens and turns quickly. It had me from the get go."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1798222-shane", "userReview": "I picked up this hard cover David Adams Richards novel off a discarded pile in a local library out of curiosity. Who would discard this doyen of Canadian literature, a writer I have had the highest admiration for?Then I realized why. This is a hard book to read because its style is so unique, and unlike the other books of this author that I have read. An omniscient narrator flits around all the characters, twisting and turning them into a plot line that goes around in circles, leaving the characters and the reader dizzy at times. Who is chasing whom? Of course everything fits into place in the end: the good are rewarded, the bad punished, and the lost ones find redemption by sacrificing their lives. The narrator also confidently gives us previews from time to time of what is to come (stay tuned, for the next chapter of...etc.) even going so far as to predict that secretarial skills would be obsolete in 10 years ( as the main action of the book takes place in 1974 \u2013 he is pretty close).The terrain is familiar Adams Richards\u2019 land \u2013 New Brunswick farm country. The characters are abused, bereaved, lost, drunk and discarded, and invent their own version of morality. Gossip and rumour fly fast in this place, through a powerful internal grapevine, and the guilty (or the supposed guilty) are punished by having their farms burned down by unknown vigilantes.Michael Skid, a privileged kid, son of a judge, falls in with this God-forsaken set of misfits and their charismatic and violent leader, Everette Hutch, and this union leads to a chain of tragic events culminating in a string of murders and suicides. Some of the situations border on implausibility even though the narrator tries hard to convince us that this is so: Michael\u2019s vulnerability and attraction to the fallen, when he has so much going for him. The narrator also takes it upon himself to occasionally throw in new bits of information on the characters that shout \u201ccontrived\u201d: Michael\u2019s intention to marry Laura McNair \u2013 that news, among many others, comes out of left field.I fully appreciate the author\u2019s original voice, and in not submitting to a proper editing that would have rendered him indistinguishable from many other Canadian writers; for example, I lost count of the number of times he began sentences with \u201cBut\u201d or \u201cSo\u201d and how often he used the word \u201csuddenly. But his choice of narrator makes this book a very \u201ctell not show\u201d one and I am not sure that he needed to go to such an extreme against the conventions of the novel to provide an outstanding voice. Original it may be, outstanding \u2013 no. No wonder, the English graduate worker at the library found this book subpar and tossed it into the \u201cDiscarded\u201d pile (my surmise only), much to my good fortune."}, {"userName": "Kevin Gallan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2762493-kevin-gallan", "userReview": "a very good book ...had a really hard time putting it down..the characters are so real,so compelling,i know them...i care for them..when they hurt, i hurt, i have read the first 11 of david adams richards books and i have to say to you david this is the best so far..."}, {"userName": "Lori L (She Treads Softly) ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4592109-lori-l-she-treads-softly", "userReview": "David Adams Richards' Mercy Among the Children was really my top book of 2009. It was so incredible that I hesitated over reading another one of Richards' books. The Bay of Love and Sorrows is the powerful tale of ambition and betrayal in a small Nova Scotia town in the 1970s. Karrie Smith and Tom Donnerel are sweethearts who, after her first year of college, have a falling out. Karrie gives in to her attraction to Tom's former friend, Michael Skid who lures Karrie into a manipulative and loveless relationship. Michael, in turn, is manipulated by a drug dealer, Everette Hutch. Those who look to Michael to help and/or protect them are disappointed to learn how incapable he really is of taking a stand.Richards's is simply an incredible writer. I know he's won awards in Canada, but, really, the man deserves a wider audience. The characters are well written but flawed; the plot is tightly defined. The intensity of the story was, at times overwhelming. You could see destruction coming, they could see it coming, and yet no one stopped it. Richards firm grasp of and insight to the human condition is, at times, heart breaking. I liked how one Amazon reviewer put it: \"Although the reader will have affinity with the characters' very human flaws, Richards never allows us to get too close and I believe he does that deliberately; this fiction takes an in-depth look at the shallowness of living on the edge and the waste that it is.\"Very Highly Recommended - but a book full of sorrow; http://shetreadssoftly.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "LiL", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2055229-lil", "userReview": "It was about were I was born and grew up and I Loved It!"}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4143381-stacy", "userReview": "It has been a long time since I have read a Richards book,and this one did not disappoint. The ones I have read are more recent; this story took place in the 70's. There is some overblown description, but overall, I love the images he invokes - and a lot of them are dark and evil. You really get a sense of what it is to be poor in rural New Brunswick and how, given a tiny break, people could get at least a chance in life. What is also evident, in the rich, is their lack of compassion, understanding, empathy, you name it. However, Michael, the chief rich boy here, pays the penalty for his crimes and poor judgement; he serves jail time, but he also finds another life in which to redeem himself. Just as there are rich and poor, good and evil, there are also grey areas in all aspects of life. People now with responsible jobs, have done things they regret from High School; seemingly respectable business owners cheat the government; highly educated people in the legal system can be misled; the church preaches goodness, but has it doors locked at critical times; girls can use sex to get what they want, but also to save people.I did not understand where this book was going at first (other than where the blurb said it would): I felt we were being led, but to what? Later, as the consequences of the initial acts and events start to unfold, we get the feeling of a snowball gathering up everything in its path until it wipes out all. I recognize a character, cop Deborah Matchette, in the story. I think I met her in Mercy Among the Children."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12165461-ted", "userReview": "David Adams Richards has become one of my favourite Canadian authors. I have thoroughly enjoyed the four books of his that I have read. The Bay of Love and Sorrows is probably his most tragic to read and contains less humour then the others. But Richards is a great writer and knows how to relate a story and get you involved in characters that you either sympathize with or that you hate so much you look forward to their untimely end. Regardless of your feelings to the character, they are fascinating, real-life people that you want to read more about and find out what happens to them next. And the backdrop of New Brunswick again acts as one of the main characters. This novel is the story of two friends who separate due to a minor misunderstanding and relates how their lives still remain connected via incidents and other people. The plot takes some unsuspecting turns and twists along the way. I look forward to reading more books by this author."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1532455-julia", "userReview": "David Adams Richards certainly has a unique way of telling a story. This is perhaps the 3rd book of his that I've read now. He writes in the 3rd person narration mode as though someone is telling the story - not one of the characters. This just gives a different perspective to the story - it's a telling and not so much feeling what is happening.This story is about a community in rural New Brunswick - a community where individuals are eeking out a living as best they can and sometimes that means that crimes are committed out of desperation. It is a tragic story, one of intense poverty and hopelessness. It is depressing, but a good read, if you can detach yourself from the pathetic problems of the characters."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2605780-holly", "userReview": "Recommended to me by a friend because I need to read more Canadian authors, and I worked in the area of NB where this story takes place. The story itself is very sad, and the way of life these people had was scary.

The novel begins as the once-strong friendship between Michael Skid, the privileged young son of a judge from town, and farmhand Tommie Donnerel collapses under the weight of a bitter misunderstanding. As Michael sets out to prove something to himself and others, he becomes drawn into the company of the beautiful and determined Madonna Brassaurd and her brother, Silver. The three are soon seduced by the glamour of Everette Hutch, a charismatic but violent man, whose latest scheme appears certain to result in tragedy. Bridging the decent world of Tommie Donnerel and the darker realm of the Brassaurds and Everette Hutch is Karrie Smith.
