Two days ago I was on page 113 of this book and I was getting frustrated with the vapid characters who were either spending all their time acting the part of the privileged upper class English ex-pats in Hong Kong or (in Claire's case) stealing trinkets. Even the war-time surrender of Hong Kong to the Japanese seemed only a minor inconvenience to these people. However, a mere 13 pages later, the story rapidly grows teeth.The Piano Teacher tells the story of two separate love affairs in the life of English ex-pat Will Truesdale. The two events are separated by a span of 12 years. In the 1940s, Will is new to Hong Kong and in love with a young Eurasian heiress, Trudy. They fill their days and nights with parties and other pleasant diversions. Even the war does little to affect their lifestyle, until the Japanese decide to put all the \"enemy civilians\" in interment camps. Will goes into the camp, but Trudy denies her British citizenship and remains free. From this point on, the story turns into a tragically human story of love, betrayal, and loss.In the 1950s, Will has an affair with a young married woman, Claire. However, Will and Claire's affair simply provides the framework for the bigger picture of what ultimately happened to Will and Trudy during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/362843-jennifer", "userReview": "Lee alternates between two different time periods to tell the story of betrayal in war time Hong Kong. (Does anyone just write a linear story any more? Seems like every book I pick up these days uses this kind of device). I really enjoyed the 1940's story line of Will and Trudy during the war - An Englishman and a Eurasian woman who are in the thick of the pre-war social scene and how their lives change when the Japanese invade Hong Kong. Will is interned as a prisoner of war and Trudy decides to collaborate to survive. Which of course goes awry...The 1950's storyline is thinner and less compelling. Will is now a driver for a rich Chinese businessman (Trudy's cousin) and he takes up with a naive young Englishwoman who is fresh off the boat with her husband. Claire is the piano teacher of the title and unfortunately, she a fairly bland and uninteresting character who simply becomes an empty vessel for the story to flow through. I enjoyed reading this book but the journey was more satisfying than the destination. Read this book for the sense of setting, the vivid image of pre-war Hong Kong, the social scene of ex-pats and rich locals vying for status but don't expect a plot that will pull you towards a resolution of importance."}, {"userName": "Britney", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60604-britney", "userReview": "I've found that it's easy to find World War II literature that focuses on the Holocaust or on the American experience. It's harder to find books that explore the non-Western experience.  The Piano Teacher explores how lives in Hong Kong in the 1950s was affected by the Japanese invasion of the British colony during the war.Ultimately, the 1940s parts were more compelling. I wanted to know more about the relationship between Will and Trudy, Will's experience in an internment camp with other Westerners, and Trudy's attempts to make nice with the Japanese and provide for her own survival. Claire, the piano teacher of the title, was much less interesting, and despite her title billing never seemed like a true protagonist. A young wife new to Hong Kong, Claire finds herself unexpectedly entangled in Will's secrets after they begin their own affair.I'd like to learn more about Hong Kong in this time period as a result of the 1940s sections of the book, but the 1950s chapters (the book switches between the two) were just not very interesting, and some character traits (for example Claire's thefts that open the book) are not carried convincingly throughout the book."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "Interested in more of my reviews? Visit my blog!I didn\u2019t enjoy this quite as much as I had hoped. The story was riveting; however, the characters were tremendously shallow, hard to understand, and extremely hard to like.The StorylineThe story switches points of view between 1953 and 1942 when World War II has struck Hong Kong. In 1953, Claire and Martin Pendleton, a recently married English couple, have moved to Hong Kong. Claire becomes a piano teacher teaching a young girl named Locket. Her parents, the Chens, employ Will Truesdale as their driver whom Claire eventually begins to have an affair with. In 1942, Trudy Liang, a Eurasian, and Will Truesdale, an Englishman, are lovers. WWII strikes Hong Kong, Will ends up in a POW camp, and Trudy forms some treacherous alliances in order to keep him alive and as safe as possible.ThoughtsThe women in this story were borderline impossible to like. Claire\u2019s \u2018habit\u2019 of stealing various items from the Chen household was the most strange and it was never really explained. There would just be occasional references to her dropping things into her purse\u2026 maybe it was explained, I may have simply missed it. Everyone seemed to be enthralled with Trudy and I couldn\u2019t understand why. She was charming in an overly obnoxious way and seemed to have quite a big head.\u2018People have always expected me to be bad and thoughtless and shallow, and I do my best to accommodate their expectations. I sink to their expectations, one might say. I think it\u2019s the ultimate suggestibility of most of us. We are social beings. We live in a social world with other people and so we wish to be as they see us, even if it is detrimental to ourselves.\u2019As the story progresses you get the whole story of what she ended up doing because of her love for Will and you can\u2019t help but dislike her a little less, except not really. I had an emotional disconnect with this story and despite Trudy\u2019s protestations of love for Will, I couldn\u2019t see it. Essentially, I found Trudy\u2019s actions to be more selfish than not, that all she did was to protect herself.

Yee could have expanded what she had so capably initiated.The manner which she utilized to relate this tale is often muddled and confusing. The story is set in Hong Kong and weaves back and forth between the 40's and 50's. She has clearly demonstrated the attitudes of class among the British, Americans and the native people. On one hand there are the people who are leading their frivolous existences similar to the \"Gatsby era\" and then there are those who humbly serve them. Character development was often flat and awkward. The time when the Japanese invaded and occupied Hong Kong was horrifying and detailed, but much was left unresolved. This chapter in history has been so much more aptly addressed in other literature. While trying to accomplish this, Yee has given the reader too little, attempting to tell too many stories and then omitting items which could have made her novel more satisfying.The actions of her main characters were not clearly defined, nor always resolved satisfactorily. The conclusion of the book was abrupt, leaving the main character, the \"piano teacher\" suspended in a strange and uncharacteristic situation."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128599-christina", "userReview": "the salespeople at Borders did me wrong! in their defense, i had but 10 minutes on my parking meter and made a hasty decision to buy this book. and what a book! what a dumb book. boring story. i kept waiting for the story to get moving and it never did. this is a slow story about a bunch of english ex-pats living in hong kong and going to parties, having affairs, stealing things.

It is a novel that attempts to provide some insights into conditions in Hong Kong prior to, during, and after World War II. It is a part of the world where the English, others, and the wealthy Chinese families form a tangled web of relationships. On the one hand, we have Will Truesdale who finds himself strangely drawn to a Eurasian sprite of a girl, Trudy Liang, who flaunts her body and her wealth around like snowflakes in a blizzard. Together they wend their way in and around the social scene in that halycon harbor. Pearl Harbor, the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong, and the containment of civilians who are not Chinese causes a rift in the mentioned characters relationship. Trudy, who is part Chinese and part POrtugese, becomes a girl toy of Otsubo, a high ranking gendarme in the Japanese army while simultaneously maintaining a liaison with Will. You guessed it! Trudy is a pawn in the hands of the Japanese who think that Will can lead them to the whereabouts of the valuable Crown Collection. In an effort to obtain the information, she is allowed to \"entertain\" Will during weekend passes from Stanley, the containment facility, while at the same time continue to \"please\" Otsubo. Where does the piano teacher fit into all of this? She doesn't until ten years later. The war is over, Will has been released, and Hong Kong has been liberated. Will is now working as a chaffeur for the Chen's, a wealthy Chinese family who coincidentally have a ten year old daughter named, Locket. As fate would have it Claire Pendleton, the wife of a Water Works inspector, becomes the child'd piano teacher. Will and Claire meet, have a steamy affair which draws the teacher into a mysterious network that binds those characters who have a knowledge of the Crown Collection's whereabouts and those who wish to find it. My poor evaluation of the novel is based on what can be summed up as a tale about arrogant, rich people who spend their time, money, and influence on gossip, tea parties, betraying one another and, of course, sex. Perhaps Y. K. Lee is right, This is what the world is really about. I just wish that she could have focused her work more on what was in the Crown Collection that made it so valuable and less on Will's dalliances with Claire and Trudy."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5276322-debbie", "userReview": "Ambitious. Somewhat intriguing. Good but not perfect.\nThe Piano Teacher definitely turned out to be much different then I thought it would be. It's a WWII story (for some reason I'm drawn to them) with flash backs. The story takes place in present of the 1950's Hong Kong, a decade after the war. A British woman named Claire arrives with her husband Martin who has obtained a position at a water plant. Claire is trying to find her place among the other expatriates and her new surroundings. She doesn't feel that she quite fits in. One of her fellow expats finds her a position as a piano teacher to a young girl from an affluent Chinese family, the Chens. The Chens have a British chauffeur named Will Truesdale. The Chens have some secrets and Will Truesdale is somehow associated in this hidden past that leads back to a time before and heightened during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during the war. Through flash backs we learn the story. What life was like before the war and during the war what people did to survive. We learn about the love of Wills life Trudy and why she's not present in Will's 1950's life yet Claire is. So, let's just get to it: I found the good parts good and the others..blah. It took this book a long time to get really started. Slow start but once it did pick up I began to like it. I liked hearing about what it was like for the expatriate socialites in Hong Kong before the war. I could just picture the carefree fun they had with all the nationality of a certain economic status melding together. Trudy was one wild character and Will seemed to languidly glide along with her going with the flow. Everything was a gas and great shebang of a good time until the war was actually at their doorstep and then sh** got real. This is location experiencing the effects of WWII that I'd never heard about. I understand every part of the world at that time experienced something. Some form of lunacy was everywhere and it was interesting to hear what it meant to this part of the world. I didn't know the Japanese went in and took Hong Kong before the Allies arrived. I didn't know that all the residents of enemy nations were sent to Internment camps in jail buildings. It was good to have a bit of a history lesson. I liked that about this book. What I didn't care for much was the flashing back and forth with no rhyme or reason. I didn't know why when I thought things were going along fine and I was interested in what I was reading, the next page was time traveling again. It got so back and forth toward the end it started to frustrate me a bit and make me feel like, \"alright already just tell me!\" Also, these secrets...to me weren't really secrets. Or worth the secrecy. It seems as if the author wanted the reader to feel a sense of this \"mystery\" but I just was not mystified. And once the supposed hidden things were brought to light I thought I missed it. I felt like \"Wait.. What?\" I was also miffed by the fact that there were too major relationships in this book but not a stitch of romance or even emotional intimacy. Anything close to a connection was glazed over. What strange representations of love. To sum up, I liked it but it was missing a few components that could have made it really good. It was ok, with potential but instead it just laid back. I thought it was taking off but then I'd turn the page \"time to do the time warp again.\"I give this book a 3 stars. I do recommend this to Historical fiction readers."}, {"userName": "Kaye", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1540476-kaye", "userReview": "It is so hard to believe that this is a debut novel. I found it wonderfully written and I was drawn in immediately. The story starts out in 1952 as we are introduced to Claire Pendleton, recent arrival in Hong Kong with her much older husband, Martin. Claire has been hired by the socially prominent Chen family to teach Locket Chen the piano. When the Chen family invites Claire and her husband to a party, she meets Will Truesdale, the Chen chauffer. The Chen family and Will Truesdale figure prominently in this novel from the beginning to the end.The story then goes back and forth from 1941 to 1953 as the characters are introduced in preparation for possible invasion by the Japanese. With the use of flashback mode and differing points of view, we see the growth in the characters and how the war deeply affects them all. Will\u2019s importance is slowly revealed when the reader is taken back to 1941 and the beginning of his passionate affair with Trudy Liang, a young, spoiled Eurasion. Trudy has numerous connections with the Hong Kong community and has a tremendous emotional impact on Will. Written with exquisite detail as to location, the reader can immerse themselves into the environs of Hong Kong. It is easy to visualize the center with its European, classical style building and yet, not far away, the local market with its narrow alley ways and frenetic activity amid smoky stalls and clamorous noise. I felt like I was walking with Claire as she becomes familiar with her new home. With her seamless segueing between decades, the character development is tremendous. The characters are so well fleshed out as to emotion and vulnerability, the reader will feel as if they are truly alive. Their emotions and feelings just seem to leap off the page.Lee unfolds each complex layer bit by bit without missing a beat. When the lives of all the characters come to a point of convergence, the past haunts the present in the many intertwined relationships. Alliances forged during the war will have long reaching consequences long after the war is over. People who had high positions now are brought to new lows, the war being the great equalizer. It all comes down to a matter of survival and the lengths people will go to cope with the horrors and atrocities of war. There are so many elements in the telling of this story: romance, loyalty, betrayal, secrets, history along with social commentary. The peripheral characters are easily woven into the story with their own interesting sub plots. The surprising twists at the end only add to the enjoyment of this novel. The progression of the story is orderly with no superfluous details and with a wonderfully engrossing plot, this book is sure to be a success. I absolutely loved it. 5*****"}, {"userName": "Robert Blumenthal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10110896-robert-blumenthal", "userReview": "There are certain writers who just grab me, and Janice Lee is definitely one of them. She has a remarkable ability to tell a story, especially in her developing of characters and evoking a setting. Her home turf is Hong Kong (both of her novels take place there), but it is how she places her characters in the setting that speaks to me. She has shown a wonderful ability to develop characters who are unrelated at the start and weave a narrative that intertwines them in ways that are both overt and subtle and coincidental.Here she deals with Hong Kong during World War II, and then 7 years after the war. There is Trudy, a beautiful, glamorous and spoiled biracial woman in the early 1940s, and then there is Claire, a British expatriate, in postwar Hong Kong hired to teach a young Chinese girl piano. And then there is Will, who connects them both. The tale is mostly about the horrors of the war years and what people did to survive. Some of the horrors were almost a bit much for me, making for very unpleasant reading. However, the intricate plot that arises from this theme is quite intriguing and compels the reader forward. And the characters all have their faults, which, I believe, makes for much more interesting characterization. I am anxiously awaiting her next book."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13295112-jennifer", "userReview": "The beginning was a little hard to get into.

Ms Lee threw a quirky little detail like that in, and just left it floating around, no reasons given. There was nothing about Melody Chen that would indicate she is the type of person to name her daughter \"Locket.\" Were names like that common in Hong Kong? Was it just a nickname? It wasn't made clear.And who is this story really about? Is it Claire? Will? Trudy? Dominick? Victor? Locket? No. I think the actual heart of this story is Edwina. If (when?) this is made into a movie, I think they should make her the central, mysterious character.And finally, the number one thing that bugged me about this book: why in the world did Will repeatedly ask Trudy to join him in prison??? Why????? How could prison seem like a better, safer, more appealing option than living free as the General's pet?? Sure she had to do a few degrading things, but Will lived in cramped conditions with malnourishment, dysentery, spoiled food, beatings, and unclogging shit-filled toilets with his bare hands.

I thought Lee was writing underdeveloped women characters, and also, she wrote her women characters as if she didn't really like women. The, after about a quarter of the book, it turns into a war novel. I really dislike novels about war. So I was not enjoying it very much. HOWEVER, about tho-thirds through the book, it starts getting really good, and everything just coalesces beautifully. Things start coming together, and before you know it, the characters are real and three-dimensional and vibrant. I really liked the book after that. Lee sure knows how to bring up heavy subjects very subtly, and how to weave a character together. I just wish it hadn't taken 66% of the novel to get to that point.

Although that's what this book sets out to portray, it accomplishes it in a different way that the author intended.Set in the historically fascinating world of British Hong Kong in the 1940s and 50s, The Piano Teacher begins as a rather artsy novel that had a lot of potential. However, it fell flat about three or four chapters in, and the rest was dull and underachieving. Where Janice K. Lee has promise as a novelist, this book needed more personal editing and plot consolidation before she slapped a title and cover on it.The novel opens on Claire Pendleton, an English lady living in Hong Kong with her somewhat platonic husband, Martin. She is employed as the eponymous piano teacher to a local family, the Chens. As the novel moves on, Claire's character is illustrated (a bit) as the girl interrupted, forced to marry someone she does not love for convenience. Her life changes when she encounters Will Truesdale, the Chen family's English driver who has a mysterious past and a strange, puzzling facade that fascinates Claire. Predictably, she is pulled into a very odd love affair, which can only end in disaster.The parallel story of Hong Kong in the 1940s is told from Will's perspective as he remembers his relationship with the fantastic socialite Trudy Liang, a young Eurasian woman. These memories, interspersed with the story of Claire and Will, follows the tragedy of the city in the grip of the Japanese throughout World War II, the incarceration of all \"enemy nationalities,\" and above all the dangerous facades of people. The end is confusing, though, which is upsetting for such a good idea.Lee opens the book with the fiery passion of a novelist, creating her world and characters with clear pictures in mind. The exposition of the world of Hong Kong, amahs, and British debutantes is an intriguing one- an Oriental reproduction of the 19th century world that vanished in Europe. Claire begins as a terribly interesting character: soon after she begins teaching the daughter, she begins to steal things from Mrs. Chen, almost in a kleptomaniac way. The first part of the book is tense, waiting for Claire's thefts to be exposed, but from there it falls off into dull predictability.Though all the characters have that subtle, human potential of being great literature, Lee falls into the trap of doing what is expected and cliche with them. The only one that delivers any sort of memorable plot point is Trudy Liang, whose end is annoyingly vague and psychologically complex. She is needy and independent all at once, leaving guilt and regret in the readers once she's gone.Too bad she's stuck in a boring book. Will, her companion in the 1940s tale, is only interesting on the surface; once Lee begins trying to explore who he is, he becomes an annoyingly waffling person with only a dark and mysterious facade. Claire's puzzling at his vague statements and behavior makes her out to be rather unintelligent, because the things that he does are not as complicated as Lee makes them out to be.I personally had no idea what to do with the character of Claire. It's almost as if she doesn't really have a place in the novel. It would almost have been better to eliminate the 1950s story entirely; by the end of the book, I didn't care about what happened to her at all, which seemed to be the goal of the epilogue. The story of Will and Trudy was far more interesting than Claire's moaning about Will's complex behavior and the thick social atmosphere in Hong Kong. (I nearly skimmed one of her chapters in order to get to the next 1940s bit.) If Lee had thought about the whole thing a little longer, The Piano Teacher might have come out as a much better novel with a more centered storyline.One thing that redeems the novel a bit is the style. At first, it seems rather dull and ordinary, but as it progresses, more interesting structures come out. The thing that stood out most is the tenses of the telling: Claire's bits are told in past tense, but Will's are told in present tense, as if recalled in present tense in a memory. As we reach the end of the novel, Will's chapters are more confusing and scattered, as if repressed memories are coming out, which really lends to the effect.It doesn't matter if there's nothing new under the sun- if you do an old idea well, then it's a joy to read. But The Piano Teacher plods out a tired story with underdeveloped editing and work, wasting its incredible potential on a very mediocre novel. It's not very long, 326 double-spaced, small pages, so it's a quick read if you have some time to kill."}, {"userName": "Vonia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia", "userReview": "So this book seriously sucked. The first few pages held some interest, but after that it didn't redeem itself until the last handful of chapters. I suppose I have no one to blame but myself and my stubbornness to finish every book that I endeavor to read. But I can assure you that I will remember little one week from now. Page-turning? \"[A book] you can't put down\"? Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. This should teach me to consider my other options very conscientiously the next time I have a book rated below a 3.5 from my fellow readers in my hands. The synopsis pretty much says it all. The narrative alternated between 1943 and 1953, telling the stories of Will Truesdale and his affair with Trudy Liang, which ended with the calamity brought on by World War II; and that of Claire Pendleton, who ends up in her own affair with Will. Claire becomes \"The Piano Teacher\" to Locket, the meek daughter to the Chens, whom Will is employed by. It is not long before sheltered and ordinary Claire becomes entagled in the stories of these other characters, changing her into an entirely different woman then she was before. She does not change on her own volition. Rather, it is because she finds herself trapped in a love triangle and between powerful forces and families she never expected to. I never really felt connected to any of the characters. Even Claire remained a two dimensional woman that I felt I knew very little about. All of the other main characters were actually unmemorable and not likeable. The story was scattered and the writing was not very proficient in regards to immersing the reader.The worst part of all this? By the end, nothing has changed for the long term. The last sentence, specifically and plainly tells of Claire's thrill at the thought of being able to walk outside right now and blend in, to become a nobody, an everybody. What a waste of what had the potential, in another author's fingers, to be a prolific story. **** Spoilers **** Claire finds out about Trudy, who Will had never fallen out of love with. He has built his entire life around the guilt he carries around from that time. As a prisoner in the internment camps, he would not agree to help Trudy out, who was doing poorly on the outside. She began to work for the enemy, at which point he blocked her out. That he did this out of cowardice; that it was because he saw then that he would do anything for her and it scared him- this only came later, when she was already dead. Apparently, The Crown Jewels were some national treasures that only three individuals knew the location for: Edwina, Will, and Victor Chen. Anyways, blah blah blah, political intrigue, scandal, double crossing, blah blah blah, Trudy's baby is actually Locket. Blah blah blah, propriety in upper class Hong Kong, social elite parties, blah blah blah. Said national treasures eventually returned to China. Will remains nonchalant. Epilogue shows Claire living alone, still in Hong Kong, but elated to no longer be the focus of anyone's attention, and to be able to blend into the rest of society and be a nobody again."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1794749-jennifer", "userReview": "I liked the book fine. The story was good, but I found that I was annoyed by the author's style, which I found disorienting and confusing. With fiction, I usually start a book and don't put the book down, but with this book, I read the first 20 or 30 pages and found the disjointed writing really did not pull me in to the story. I put the book down and didn't come back for over a month --- and didn't really have a burning desire to come back during that time.I have recently read Water for Elephants, which also jumped back and forth from past to \"present\" day. But with Water for Elephants, this technique was used expertly -- with smooth transitions back and forth that enhanced the story.Here, I felt this technique was contrived at times. And even within chapters, the writing jumped from topic to topic, as if the author kept thinking of a clever description or factoid she wanted to throw in but couldn't figure out how to really weave it in. She got better at it later in the book, but overall, her style was trying too hard to be \"literary\" -- if you know what I mean.And ultimately, I felt the climax of the book was deliberately and unnecessarily coy and oblique. Too many loose ends, too many allusions to a resolution without really telling us what happened, too much beating around the bush. I don't necessarily need a happy fairytale ending, but in the key moment when the mystery unravels, don't leave us trying to figure out what the heck the book is saying."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3131238-judy", "userReview": "Have you ever read a book at just the right time? That was the case with this book. I was feeling like something light, chicklit-ish, so this book hit the spot. I enjoyed the backdrop of the British-Chinese-Japanese contention. The portrayal of the Chinese difficulty in survival in their own country, camps, British betrayal of the Chinese and the look at some Chinese who profited by selling out their own people offered several perspectives of this terrible time in Chinese history. All that aside, this is the story of Clare, a piano teacher to the wealthy Chen's daughter. When Clare ends her piano lessons, she is driven home by Will, the Chinese Chen's white chauffeur. Married Clare falls in love with the emotionally-distant Will. The revelations that follow of Will's only love, Trudy, open up the ugliness of war and what people will do for power and wealth.Like I mentioned earlier, I listened to this book at the right time. For this reason, I gave it four stars. At any other time, it would likely only have received three stars.

The plot had such potential, but Lee chose to squander it somewhat. I'll admit I enjoyed the past/present flow of the story, but the actual story was more boring than anything. I found myself waiting and waiting for Lee to get to the point, to no avail. I assumed (naively) that since I'm waiting and waiting for this giant secret to emerge, that it would have to be something worthwhile. But alas, I was wrong! It was the most obvious secret ever! I was thoroughly disappointed. I will say that Lee turned out to be a good writer and I enjoyed the prose more than anything else. However, along with the boring plot, I found the characters to be extremely unrealistic and unlikeable. I know that I would never become friends, or even acquaintances with these people because they all seemed self-righteous and horrible. Although they come from privilege, I'm sure most in the upper class would be highly offended at this vulgar portrayal. They were completely unrelatable in every way.Overall, an easy yawn, lots of potential, yet very unremarkable."}, {"userName": "Morana Mazor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30488471-morana-mazor", "userReview": "Malo mi je te\u017ee opisati ovu knjigu jer je nekako \u010dudna (barem meni); mislim, po\u010detak je polagan i treba vremena da se pohvataju likovi, a i radnju pratimo paralelno u dva vremenska perioda.

B/c it's had such a profound affect on me....like a Megan Hart it's staying and not going quietly...I've decided to give it 5 stars. I stopped giving stars, in the hopes that you guys would read the review and then decide if the book was one you'd like to read but I feel so strongly about this one.....My emotion at the moment is one of despair there is one character in this book who is detestable, a vile charcater they are not a main player but when, at the end you find out what this person has done the full force of what this book is about comes home. There are many things I would like to talk about from the bigotry, the racism (especially that felt towards eurasain)and the attitude of the Britsh who lived not only in Honk Kong but in other colonys around the world at that time. I feel however that to discuss those at this time would spoil the book for others even I placed a spoiler tag. Save to say Trudy is the person who has stuck with me (I think she will for a long time to come) and even whilst I'm typing this I'm crying at the bloody injustice of everything!!!I expect I will add more to this review as time goes on but for the moment I'm trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered soul. Dramatic I know but that's how it's got me. Silly stupid book LOLOctober 9 Oh God I was going to reserve my review until I had time to reflect on what I've just read. I will say here that this is not a story for anyone who likes a HEA/HFN in their reading the ending does bring closure but I would also like to think that maybe just maybe Will and Claire story continues of screen so to speak. This is a sad story of what people will do to survive and the lies some will tell to secure their survival, and the consequences of those lies and the devistation to others that those lies have. I think the author intended this to a sort of coming of age story of a young Englishwoman (Claire) in post war Hong Kong but my romantic heart has also read this: the tragic,tragic love story between Will and Trudy pre-war, and then the impossible love that Will and Claire share post-war. The two stories are linked by a separate tale of deception and collaberation. I can't speak highly enough of this story. I may add more to this review but at the moment I want to just let go of it quitely."}, {"userName": "Maya Panika", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1411655-maya-panika", "userReview": "Don't judge a book by its cover!

Underneath that surface lies a cleverly constructed mystery about a beautiful socialite who disappears during the war and the people responsible, directly and indirectly, for her death.

This book switches between the the early 1940's and the early 1950's. Set in Hong Kong, it is easy to follow these jumps from from one era back and forth to the other. The title makes the reader assume that the main character is the person who teaches piano (Claire). Claire is in the 1950's part of the story. The 1940's part focuses on Will Truesdale and Trudy Liang. Will is an Englishman and Trudy is part Chinese and part Portuguese. Trudy is beautiful, outgoing, charismatic, and knows how to use her sex appeal. Her character will do whatever needs to be done to continue to live in the luxurious lifestyle she wants, even if she has to do something others would deem uncomfortable, illegal or dangerous. Will falls under Trudy's spell. Trudy does love Will. Despite Trudy's free spirit ways, the reader learns that Will has actually had an impact on the type of person Trudy becomes. (NOTE: Will is eventually interned with the other expats, while Trudy is allowed to remain free.) The reader quickly surmises that Trudy became a casualty of war. In the early 1950's Claire arrives in Hong Kong with her new husband. (Claire married her husband to escape life under her parents domain. She is not in love with her husband.) Soon after Clair's arrival Will begins an affair with her. There doesn't seem to be any true affection of Will towards Claire because Trudy is always there - in his heart and mind. There is much else that goes on in this book involving the other characters and the impact they have on what has happened and what happens to Trudy, Will and Claire during the Japanese occupation of Japan and after the war. There are turncoats and the atrocities of war and occupation are very much a part of this book. I did not find this book a quick read at the beginning. In fact, it was easy to put down. The last half was a better read; however, the ending was a disappointment. It seemed like the author was hurried to tie up all the loose pieces too quickly. I have recently read several books that occur during this era of prewar and post WWII. They take place on American soil. One, is a true story written from the perspective of a young Japanese American girl. She was fortunate enough to escape internment due to the brief period that was allowed for \"voluntary\" evacuation. The other is based on actual historical events and places, about a Chinese boy who falls in love with a Japanese girl and how a family's hatred can alter a person's life. These books are A Time of Innocence by Sanae Kawaguchi and Hotel on the Corner of Bitter & Sweet by Jamie Ford.If my review discourages you from reading The Piano Teacher, I encourage you to look at reviews on Amazon.com and elsewhere. You will get a better idea of whether or not you will like the book by reading more favorable reviews."}, {"userName": "Marc Maitland", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5975255-marc-maitland", "userReview": "Because of the mixed reviews, and this being the author\u2019s first work, I really had no idea what to expect. Criticised by some and described as \u201cthis year\u2019s \u2018Atonement\u2019\u201d by others (in a presumably complimentary way), I was very pleased with both the plot and the very well-researched attention to detail. In my opinion, it is a far better read than Ian McEwan\u2019s \u201cAtonement\u201d, which I read (and reviewed) a year ago. I don\u2019t even want to attempt to summarise the plotline, which basically jumps between the time of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941 and the time of the Coronation in 1953 and the same characters and what has changed in the intervening period, the eponymous Piano Teacher being someone who brings together the various earlier characters in a wholly innocent way, although as will be seen, she is far from a wholly innocent character herself. I just love the detailed description of colonial life, and it is paradoxically mainly written from the perspective of an outsider (as indeed the author herself is \u2013 Korean by birth, having been raised as a child in Hong Kong under British colonial rule, having them emigrated to the U.S.A. and then having returned after the hand-over to China after 1997) which is exactly what Trudy, one of the main characters (\u201cheroine\u201d would be a misnomer) is, of Chinese/Portuguese parentage, known as \u201cEurasian\u201d. At the end of the book, there is an interesting list of the research undertaken by the author before writing the book \u2013 a project which was 5 years in its fulmination. I don\u2019t know if all authors undertake such diligent research but, for me, who really does appreciate accurate detail of novels set in a real time and real place, this was worth the effort, and much appreciated. I can unreservedly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in wartime, colonial history or even just the geographical descriptions of Hong Kong and life there in the 1940s and 1950s. For a Royalist like me, that the latter part of the book centred on the Coronation of Her Majesty The Queen and all the celebrations that took place in the furthest corners of the Empire, was the icing on top of the cake!"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/313885-lori", "userReview": "Claire, the piano teacher of the title, is a bland, blonde, naive young British newlywed recently relocated to Hong Kong with her husband. She takes a position as a piano teacher for the young daughter of a wealthy Chinese family and she is introduced to the brittle, shallow, wealthy, prejudiced expatriate community in 1950's Hong Kong. Eventually she meets and begins an affair with Will Truesdale, a long-time British expatriate with a mysterious history.Alternating chapters with Claire's story is the recounting of a love affair between Will and Trudy in the 1940's. Trudy is a Eurasian socialite, a charming, glittering, brilliant Fitzgerald-type character determined to keep her wealth, privilege and partying lifestyle at all costs. The Will and Trudy sections are by far the more compelling sections of this novel. When Hong Kong surrenders to Japan and Will is interred in a civilian prison camp, I had trouble putting the book down. It's an aspect of WWII that gets far less coverage and how each character struggles to survive in the war is heartbreaking, frustrating, highly readable. I really liked this part of the book.Claire's sections are much weaker. She slowly learns Will and Trudy's story, which creates tension and suspense in the latter part of the book, but she seems peripheral and I never did find it believable that a character like Will would get involved with her. I did enjoy watching her character slowly become more self-aware as she goes through a Kate Chopin-style awakening, and I guess she also functions to highlight the artificiality of the social codes and behaviors of the expatriate community that is shaken and wrecked by the war, only to re-invent itself into a smooth icing covering the old history, betrayals, and prejudices."}, {"userName": "Amit Shetty", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7280101-amit-shetty", "userReview": "A beautiful story with no ending\nThe above statement probably summarizes how I feel about the book. Set in China, the story deals with a multitude of characters with no one playing the central role (not even the piano teacher). What I loved about this book was the fact that every chapters shifted from one timeline to another giving the reader a detailed glimpse of the present and the past. This is particularly effective in this book since the past basically deals with the multitude of crimes committed by the Japanese during the final days of World War 2 and the present day peaceful conditions.Another brilliant feature that the author has taken into account is describing vividly, the conditions of the people living during the 1942-43 period and how dramatically their lives were changed from all night parties to being treated like cattle in war camps. Also, one can never forget the unique character of Trudy Liang. So full of life, even when she was being exploited both physically and mentally.As I mentioned before, the story has no ending (I know this calls for a spoiler alert, but after spending so much time on a book, you kinda expect that).

Not a single person was likable, especially the main characters. Usually, if I don't like the main characters, I can find minor characters that make up for it, but this time, they weren't there.I didn't care about Claire's story at all. She was a thief who cheated on her husband, both of which were done with very little remorse on her part, even when she found out that a girl lost her job because of her. The revelation of her affair to Martin was very anticlimactic. The relationship with Will was thin, and though the book is named for Claire and she starts it out, she really has very little to do with the story.I thought the real story was everything that happened in 1942-1943. I might have enjoyed this book more if the author had focused on that and made that period the entire story. I was very disappointed with the conclusion of everything, and I wanted to know more about the Crown Collection and those involved.

It's a city teeming with people, sights, sounds, and smells, and it's home to a group of foreign nationals who enjoy the good life among the local moneyed set, in a tight-knit social enclave distanced from the culture at large. Comfortable, clever, and even a bit dazzling, they revel in their fancy dinners and fun parties. But their sheltered lives take an abrupt turn after the Japanese occupation, and though their reactions are varied -- denial, resistance, submission -- the toll it takes on all is soon laid bare. Enter Claire Pendleton from London. Months after her husband is transferred to Hong Kong in 1951, she accepts a position as a piano teacher to the daughter of a wealthy couple, the Chens. Claire begins to see the appeal of the sweltering city and is soon taken in by the Chen's driver, the curiously underutilized Will Truesdale. A handsome charmer with a mysterious limp, Will appears to be the perfect companion for Claire, who's often left to her own devices. But a further examination leaves her with more questions than answers.An intricately woven tale of lives changed by historical events, Lee's debut brings this hothouse flower of a city alive with passion, and imagines characters both unforgettable and tragic.", "title": "The Piano Teacher", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4332082-the-piano-teacher", "average": 3.33, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347352842l/4332082.jpg", "reviews": 2739, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1605157.Janice_Y_K_Lee", "name": "Janice Y.K.
