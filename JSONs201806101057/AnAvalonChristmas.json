More character than plot driven, they are a beautiful and heartwarming stories. The stories are connected not only by being set in the same town, but some characters are in more than one story, and events are often referenced that took place in previous stories.The author's writing style reminds me of the stories by Fannie Flagg. The characters are authentic, and as soon as I finished one story, I couldn't wait to read the next one. This a good book to curl up with on a cold night with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea.The stories really make you feel the true spirit of the Christmas season without being religious or preachy."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733932-lori", "userReview": "This heart-warming story collection portrays the spirit of Christmas as displayed by the residents of Avalon, Illinois. Some stories are more interesting than others. Characters occasionally reappear in other stories. Most of the stories mention Harmony Homes, a facility for seniors which appears to include both independent living and assisted-living portions. This collection puts the reader in the Christmas spirit. Several recipes, including the Amish Friendship Bread and variations mentioned in the text, appear following the final story."}, {"userName": "Laura  Hernandez", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16419149-laura-hernandez", "userReview": "3.5/5This was a sweet story and I enjoyed listening to it during my workout.

If you have previously read \"Friendship Bread\" and \"Avalon Ladies Scrapbooking Society\" besides a mention and some actually sightings you don't get to follow up with characters from the previous novel that much.I on the other hand ended up loving mostly all of the 12 short stories included in this novella. I generally do like most Christmas themed books. There were only two stories that I found to be sad and not uplifting (Chapter 6: Late Bloomers and Chapter 8: And We're Wassailing) but found that besides those two that I loved the other stories.Ms. Gee does keep a narrative thread working through all of the stories about an anonymous donor and we do revisit characters that appeared in the first story and then the last. I hope in her next Avalon novel that Ms. Gee revisits some of the characters like Mary and Daryl who appeared in Chapter 1 and 12.Ms. Gee includes recipes and also provides details on how to make friendship bread. I do have plans on making some this holiday season since the recipe looks to be very easy.I recommend to those fans who want to catch up with the town of Avalon."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600090-kathryn", "userReview": "ThIs collection of short stories all taking place in Avalon just felt good to read during the holidays.

This book was just like the rest that I have read, with a compilation of various Christmas stories, all taking place in Avalon. Some of the characters are repeated throughout the stories however, most of them are newly introduced, with scenarios that depict the beauty of Christmas. As I was reading the stories, many of them I was able to picture in my mind, which made me both happy and satisfied; that is how I am able to tell how good a book is. If I can picture the plot as I'm reading, then the author did a great job of describing exactly as they should. A wonderful collection which makes you warm up to the holiday season; highly-recommended!"}, {"userName": "Ivy Kaprow", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5309480-ivy-kaprow", "userReview": "I absolutely adore the Friendship Bread series. When I read one, not only am I transported to Avalon but I become part of the community. Because Christmas in Avalon is a series of vignettes, only being tied together in the last one, I didn't feel as connected. Instead of becoming an Avolonian, I was an outsider looking in instead of being included. I would have much preferred one complete story and I am anxiously awaiting another wonderful novel that will turn me into an Avolonian."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4792595-teresa", "userReview": "Delightful Christmas StoriesThis book is a delightful set of short stories around a Christmas theme.

Melvin O'Malley's daughter has abandoned him for the holidays in a senior facility, and shop owner Margot West is intent on creating the best holiday shopping experience for her customers when a stranger threatens to ruin it.But a few surprises await them as well--an anonymous donor is giving away free turkeys at the Pick and Save, and there's an air of mystery surrounding a generous raffle prize for the upcoming Christmas Bazaar.

Most of the people have been living in the town for years, and not everyone is looking forward to the Christmas holidays. Some are feeling lonely as they have lost their loved ones, some are losing their business or their homes, whilst others try to see the best in the holidays.The stories have a loose link with each other and the reader ends up back where they started with the Senior Centre and the inhabitants there in.The stories are not too \u201ctwee\u201d \u2013 there is a positive feeling at the end of each story, even if the overall situations are not the most positive.There are recipes at the end of the book, including a sough dough starter for sharing with others, and for which I will keep this ebook for reference later!These are not the most indepth set of stories: there is enough character development of the relevant people in each story, but these are short stories so that is appropriate \u2013 you get a decent enough indication of the people involved and what happens why.

You will find from the read that this is a wonderful town to live in especially during the Christmas holiday season. These stories are of individuals lives and their dealings with the community during 'Christmas, a senior facility, anonymous giving and the Bah Humbug Club.' This author did a wonderful job with giving the reader a read that will lift your spirits of the Christmas holiday. Many of the stories brought tears along with some plenty of laughter. I think my favorite was the Bah Humbug story and I would truly recommend you pick up \"A Avalon Christmas\" to find out which one you like the best. I would recommend these stories because they are all beautifully written and these stories will be found so very heartwarming. So, with that being said I would recommend you to sit down and read about this special town in Avalon, Illinois."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2523853-mary", "userReview": "Full of Christmas spirit. Well written, clever, and heartwarming stories that will anyone with the spirit of Christmas. I know. I've been down in the dumps having moved with my family to another Country. Even though Christmas is 10 days away it felt like a hundred to me. I decided to take a chance on this book, as I was looking for something that might make me feel more in to the holidays. I was less than 1/2 way through when I felt my heart warm like the Grinch's. The Author mentions Maeve Binchy in one of her stories and truth be told, and I don't say this lightly because Maeve Binchy is my all time favorite author, Darien Gee has a little of Maeve Binchy's style in her work."}, {"userName": "Debra Torgerson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27451749-debra-torgerson", "userReview": "Wonderful!!!!Love this book of short stories centered around the small community of Avalon.

In some ways Avalon reminded me of the mythical Brigadoon - the village that appeared one day every 100 years, and so never changed.
