It's a novel that asks not necessarily to be liked but to be reckoned with. It has some scorchingly good writing for a debut. While Marie, a Dallas waitress, feels less like a fully formed character and more of a vessel for all of the service industry's drugs and sex and racism and awful men to be dumped into, she's still deftly drawn. She almost tragically embraces the role she's fallen into; she's a sharp and brilliant observer of those around her but also someone who courts pain; promiscuity is an easy and reliable course of existence, her fellow restaurant workers a kind of perverted family. She can't be a proper, present mother to her young daughter, even though Marie's love for her is tenderly portrayed; she can't appreciate the seeming goodness of her ex-husband, who impregnated her on a church mission in high school. When she's working, it's a performance, and she often self-destructively chooses not to end that performance once she leaves the restaurant. To think of the number of men she sleeps with is like imagining the progress of the national debt clock.In the acknowledgments, Tierce--a former waitress, Iowa MFA grad and already a celebrated writer--thanks a fellow author for convincing her that her \"restaurant stories\" were a larger book. But this isn't really a novel; the shock of the writing and Marie's behavior is unsettling enough, but that the format of that \"larger book\" never quite congeals into a sustained narrative helped unnerve me even more. It's a brutally perfect way of conveying Marie's dissociative existence, throughout which she keeps her \"dignity separate, somewhere else, attached to different things.\u201d Read this book, suspend your disbelief for 200 pages, and go hug somebody you love afterward."}, {"userName": "Sue Bridehead (A Pseudonym)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/792145-sue-bridehead-a-pseudonym", "userReview": "MFA erotica."}, {"userName": "AmberBug *shelfnotes.com*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884689-amberbug-shelfnotes-com", "userReview": "www.shelfnotes.com reviewDear Reader,Boy, this was gritty. It made me blush, which is pretty hard to do. I love Palahniuk, so this should have been a cake-walk. In truth, it was but I could see SO many readers turn away from this book due to the language and sleazy situations. As dirty as this book is, the truth is... so is real life (especially in the foodservice industry). This novel should be read as a warning as to what life can give you and how you should avoid the crap (a don't end up like this! cautionary tale). We all know someone like Marie, the slutty waitress that has no inhibition and lets people walk all over her. Some will look at her with disgust, others with pity but after reading this book... just MAYBE, the looks will change to understanding. Some people get shit on and others let it happen. This is life. This is the essence of this book. Truth, dirty and real and nothing you can do will stop it from happening. There are times I want to scream at the book and take a chunk out of it with my teeth.Have any of you worked in the food industry? I did briefly, and from my experience this book is pretty dead on. Each little detail of what a day is like during the hustle and bustle of a mealtime is perfectly, horribly accurate. Hard work, end of story. I almost think that the way the job is might have something to do with the drugs, drinking and debauchery that happen, to get away from reality. Nobody wants to live like that forever, right? Theres parts of this book that make me feel grimey, like if I took my finger and rubbed it on the page, it would come back black with grime. I liked this book but do I think this is everyones cup of tea? No way. Do I think it's important to have a book that shows the perspective of a messed up girl working her butt off? Yes. People like this exist and I'll even admit that I've had my moments throughout the years that I can be ashamed of... but should we shy away from the reality of it? No. If you aren't afraid to get your hands dirty (well, maybe more your mind), read this book, I can promise you you'll learn something.Happy Reading,AmberBug"}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6970518-lauren", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I've read in years. Tierce has an incredible voice and I find her to be a truly inspiration debut fiction author. Her story \"Suck It\" (this inspiration for the novel) was wild and unforgiving and to see the book developed in it's entirety is phenomenal.We never get the true motivation of Marie, the main character, as she spirals into long hours, late nights, sex and drugs and I so appreciate Tierce's stylistic choice in this. The scenes are raw and what we see are the hardships young women face when coming into their own. It's painful and gritty and gutsy and it forces you to think about where your own life choices could (or could have) lead you.I'm recommending this book to everyone that I know. I think it challenges readers not to merely observe a character's story but to feel it (and feel it HARD)."}, {"userName": "Mientras Leo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6348927-mientras-leo", "userReview": "Me ha encantado, es un libro estupendo lleno de bocados de una realidad que no siempre es como imaginamos.Muy buena protagonistahttp://entremontonesdelibros.blogspot..."}, {"userName": "Kalen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1736960-kalen", "userReview": "I'm going to be thinking about this book for a long time, but here are some initial thoughts. This one is not for everyone, despite the review I read proclaiming that the reader was going to recommend it to everyone. She's gonna have a lot of disappointed friends. This is a raw book--there is nothing pretty, happy, comforting about it. It is ugly (but well-written ugly.) Also, it is not plot-driven and if that's how you like your fiction, again, not for you. The title is misleading. I don't think Marie is really all that interested in love; she's interested in replacing one pain with another. (There was a great line about this in the book and I cannot find it. Tierce said it better than I can.) Marie wants to \"napalm her emotions.\" Tierce was named one of the National Book Foundation's Five Under 35 in 2013 and I can't wait to see what she gives us next. This wasn't my favorite book of the year but it was compelling, well-written, and left me wanting more--not necessarily of Marie's story, but of Tierce's fiction.

On the one hand, I admire its unapologetic rawness and its truly terrific writing -- but I still need a little bit of plot to really sustain my interest in a book, even if it is short.Instead of a novel, Love Me Back reads very much like a series of somewhat interconnected stories, recounting the various occupational anecdotes and sexual escapades of Marie, a young, single mother who goes from job to job in the restaurant industry. The narrative thread that binds these episodes together, though, is not strong enough for my particular taste and I found myself doing a bit of skimming towards the end. Tierce is clearly a gifted writer, but her work strongly resonates with the touchstones of an MFA writing degree. One could argue that in this type of book nothing very exciting happens, but Love Me Back knows that about itself. Unabashedly character-driven, this book is literary fiction in the strongest sense of the genre -- and, while some will certainly LOVE it for its meanderings, its interiority, and its grit, it is not the type of book that is for everybody."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4765517-sarah", "userReview": "This book was so awful.

Merritt Tierce is that kind of writer, the strong and capable kind whose sentences have been whittled down to all of the important, gut-kicking words. Unfortunately, other times she\u2019s so entwined with her story that paragraphs with the minutia of restaurant-life, the inside baseball stuff, gets stacked for pages and pages. The rest of the time, she\u2019s telling essentially the same story over and over with different characters. That story is: My name is Marie. I hate myself, so I did this to dull it and I did this to feel it in a different way.\u201cLove Me Back\u201d is told in a nonlinear collection of short stories. Marie gets pregnant as a teenager and ends up married to the good-guy father. But she cheats on him and cheats on him until he\u2019s unable to ignore it and then, feeling cast into an ill-fitting role, she leaves him with the young girl. She makes a living in restaurants -- first Olive Garden then, later, an upscale steakhouse she refers to as The Restaurant. Along the way she bangs managers, co-workers, friends of co-workers, brothers, managers from different restaurants and more. In her free time, she snorts and cuts and has gooey mom thoughts about the daughter she sees during her limited amount of custody.When I was in my 20s, I thought it was very romantic to hate yourself and treat people shitty -- like you were guided by some sort of but-this-is-just-how-I-am-ness, shrug, I can\u2019t help it. Tierce\u2019s Marie would fall into that category, as a woman seemingly unable to manage the job of self-care, but wholly capable of servicing strangers -- both at The Restaurant, where she is considered \u201cgolden\u201d and in the parking lot behind the restaurant. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s romantic anymore. I think it\u2019s exhausting -- especially in the case of this novel where she shows no real signs that she will ever be interested in yanking her boots free of the muck. Without a glimmer of change on the horizon, the stories begin to feel repetitious. Like, if Marie was your friend you would stand at your shared work station nodding along and wishing that if she planned on continuing to self-destruct, she would find some new ways to do it. I can\u2019t wait to read what she writes next, though, and my hope upon hopes is that there isn\u2019t a man or a restaurant or an orifice or a sharp instrument anywhere near it."}, {"userName": "Julia Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10573902-julia-rose", "userReview": "Lost in early adulthood and the riot of the service industry, Marie attempts to numb herself with work, sex, and drugs. She's a young mother who\u2019s never felt motherly; she gives everyone her body but keeps her heart closed; she\u2019s a vegetarian working in an upscale steakhouse. Merritt Tierce spares no detail of Marie\u2019s reckless self-destruction in a way that\u2019s shocking without sensationalism. There is nothing flashy here, where a less adept writer could misstep into melodrama. Love Me Back searing, raw, and matter-of-fact. Tierce\u2019s stunning ability to convey Marie\u2019s desolation without just telling is effortless and real. Rarely do we get observations from our damaged narrator about her emotions\u2014because she herself doesn\u2019t want to look there\u2014but when we do, they drop like anvils. We feel her ache, her desperation, her brokenness so fully. Expertly written and completely consuming.

Tierce's writing is good...brutal and raw and good. I just couldn't get pulled in. I needed more. I was on guard about whether I was just a prudish soccer mom in my reaction to some of the more explicit scenes, but I wasn't shocked, I was bored. As another reviewer wrote, they just seemed mechanical and lacking motivation. I realize that was the point: Marie was acting mechanically and without any real motivation, but it didn't have enough to keep me hooked. Tierce's writing is tight. On an academic level, I appreciate her relentless portrayal of Marie's situation. On an emotional level, I just felt like I was stuck in the rut of the same tire tracks for a long time."}, {"userName": "Clara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44200069-clara", "userReview": "Hac\u00eda mucho que no le\u00eda un libro del tir\u00f3n. Depende del momento de tu vida en el que te encuentres, supongo: el d\u00f3nde y el c\u00f3mo imponen condiciones dif\u00edciles de circunvalar. A veces, pocas veces, encuentras la prosa que te salta la valla, que llega donde quiera llegar, poderosa y conquistadora. Love Me Back se compone de esa prosa. Merritt Tierce te tira un pu\u00f1ado de cenizas a la cara y t\u00fa le das las gracias.La crudeza de la narrativa de la Marie protagonista es tan brutal como reconocible. Sorprende con su actitud a la vez desafiante y pasiva, sin remordimientos pero tambi\u00e9n lidiando con la incapacidad de absorber las consecuencias de sus actos. \u00bfSer\u00e1 porque son demasiado grandes, o porque en el fondo no supone diferencia alguna? \u00bfImporta, acaso? La cronolog\u00eda se enreda en una vor\u00e1gine de autodestrucci\u00f3n, arrastr\u00e1ndote con ella para llevarte como testigo. \u00bfQui\u00e9n no ha sido una herida abierta e insensible en alg\u00fan momento? En carne viva, calculas que no puedes permitirte el tiempo que te llevar\u00eda la cicatrizaci\u00f3n, y en su lugar prologas con inercia y convencimiento el estado de shock, la situaci\u00f3n de emergencia hasta que el cuerpo aguante. Y en la primera juventud, en la que todav\u00eda no sabemos qui\u00e9nes somos ni para qu\u00e9 conservarnos, el cuerpo aguanta mucho. Sus l\u00edmites se hacen manifiestos al tiempo, a veces demasiado tarde, a veces nunca, adelantados por la derecha por el fin de la vida.La precariedad tiene muchas caras, pero todas se parecen y en sus giros terminan siendo indistinguibles. La precariedad laboral alimenta a la econ\u00f3mica que alimenta a la familiar que alimenta a la emocional que alimenta a la corporal y esta relaci\u00f3n no cambia coloques donde coloques sus elementos. Su operador es la pobreza, cuyos determinantes son absolutos e inescapables. Marie se entrega a la pobreza, aceptando su suerte con una resoluci\u00f3n que se queda a un paso de ser suicida.Todas las caras de la precariedad son s\u00f3rdidas, y cualquier esfuerzo en camuflar este hecho ser\u00e1 deshonesto y afectado. Love Me Back es el caso opuesto, record\u00e1ndote con cada puntuaci\u00f3n la necesidad de mirar lo org\u00e1nico y lo sucio y verlo por lo que es. Sin exponerlas en abierto plantea muchas preguntas importantes, como qu\u00e9 es el sexo sin placer, qui\u00e9n puede permitirse consumir drogas por recreo, qui\u00e9n puede permitirse expresar y consumar deseos de cualquier tipo, qui\u00e9n puede permitirse circunscribirse a la narrativa que llamamos \"familia\". Qu\u00e9 es una familia. Qu\u00e9 es una persona. Qui\u00e9n eres t\u00fa.La buena prosa puede llevarte donde quiera, es el veh\u00edculo de lo que se le antoje a quien la plasme. Merritt Tierce te lleva por las sendas m\u00e1s abruptas para que las recorras con una mil\u00e9sima del da\u00f1o. Y una mil\u00e9sima todav\u00eda duele. Pero es dolor del bueno.

There's some kind of golden age going on right now. I don't think anyone has noticed! Merritt plunges you into a very intense world of coke & alcohol & very very casual sex and single waitress motherhood; but it\u2019s not the waitress stuff of let\u2019s say Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, it\u2019s at one of Dallas\u2019 very top restaurants where some of the punters will tip $300-800 and think it\u2019s money well spent. So, you know, out of my league, I don\u2019t know about your league. The staff do these frantic high pressure shifts but they get good money for it. In their time off, if Love Me Back is anything to go by, they\u2019re sleazeballs and dope fiends and no one keeps their underwear about their persons for very long. A few quotes may give you the jist of the thing. Took me until page 119 to find some that I could quote without being flagged as grossly inappropriate (\u201cwe made a sandwich on the carpet and I was the middle. I\u201d \u2013 stopppp!!).He was the one who had it worst for Shaila, even worse than Ahmed. You could tell by how they sat at the table \u2013 she\u2019d be leaning back giving off this all-balls safari-guide vibe and Matt would sit forward in his chair to catch the invisible gazelles of wisdom leaping out of her mouth.I wish I didn\u2019t want the exotic man who knows the entire history of jazz, and instead wanted the teacher, who has flaws but whose kindness is as rare as genius.In that restaurant all of us were off. Chipped. Everybody on the way to the curve. Maybe it\u2019s the same in a law firm, a nail salon, whatever high or low. Maybe that\u2019s just what it is to be alive, you\u2019ve got that broken sooty piece of something lodged inside you making you veer left.(Who would think of sooty?)The Baron was this Turkish guy who pretended to be Italian and dropped by The Restaurant once or twice a year. He\u2019d show up like we\u2019d been waiting for him and no one else through all that intervening time, each of us frozen in uniform, in place, until his presence disseminated some magic dust to make us come alive so we could fulfil our destinies of serving him. So my main problem, and it\u2019s just an aesthetic puzzle, is well, is this a memoir once again wrote up and called a novel \u2013 like Dept of Speculation and The Wallcreeper? And if so, does that matter? From an interview with Merritt Tierce:I don\u2019t really have a pat answer for \u201cIs this autobiographical?\u201d Because that is a question that I\u2019m always asked in some form or another. I\u2019m interested in why that is such a fascinating thing. I mean, anytime I read something\u2014like, Junot D\u00edaz stories, for example; I know enough about him, the person, to think, Is this based on his life? Did he do this? Is he like this as a lover? How can I find out? It seems like a really instinctive human response \u2026 I don\u2019t know why that is. If you find out that yes, it\u2019s totally autobiographical and they\u2019re just calling it fiction, how do you feel? As compared to: if you find out no, they made up every word, it just happens to be like them in some ways. Are you asking that question because you think it\u2019s evidence of greater talent or more skill as an artist, to invent things, or are you asking that because you just want to fulfil your voyeuristic urge to know? Or you want to find out if the person standing in front of you did the things you read about in this book\u2014Yes, she nails it. Does it matter? And yet, Diablo Cody\u2019s excellent book Candy Girl (subtitle: My Year as an Unlikely Stripper ) is given to us as a memoir, it could just as easily have been served up as her first novel. I don\u2019t know if it matters, it just bugs me. Some women are going to be smiting their brows at some of this stuff, the self-harming is a little bit corny I agree (but hey, I just thought of why this is called a novel and not a memoir \u2013 it\u2019s so Merritt can faithfully record every true detail of her former life and when someone chokes on this or that incident she may then say hey, it\u2019s a novel you know...)My ex punched the wall the one time he wanted to hit me, and I probably deserved it. Conclusion:This whirling bitter dazzling account of a life falling zigzaggedly between several reasonable possibilities into high unreasonableness is a modern American must read .I wouldn\u2019t let myself look away from what I was doing and to punish myself for seeing it I wouldn\u2019t let myself fix it."}, {"userName": "Miranda Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7417265-miranda-lynn", "userReview": "2.5 stars Well that was bizarre!I'm now having trouble remembering why it even ended up on my to-read list in the first place. It was a really different read, though, so I guess I kind of appreciated it for that. It was just such a strange and all-over-the-place kind of book. It was written in first-person narration with not very much punctuation (including no quotation marks, which for some readers might be hard to get used to), and it skipped around a lot in time. There were times when I had a hard time keeping up and wondered what the heck was going on. Most of the time, though, I was trying to figure out the point of this book. There's absolutely zero plot \u2014 Love Me Back is just this tiny glimpse into a four-year period of this random waitress's life, and it was pretty much entirely centered on her drug use and willingness to have sex with just about anybody, featuring lots of graphic descriptions and super weird situations she'd managed to get herself into. I thought that it was decently well-written \u2014 Marie's character was intricate, with many levels that are explored in this book. She's a tough character to like, because she makes some really bad decisions, but it's also hard not to sympathize with her, because she clearly is a lost soul who is struggling to find any sort of happiness in her life. But I didn't find myself enjoying the read very much. There were a lot of characters that were hard to keep track of, it was difficult to navigate the timeline, and the story never actually went anywhere. There isn't a whole lot of depth. Marie is basically the same exact person she is at the beginning of the book as she is at the end. We do get a brief look at what her life was like before she got pregnant, and I'm glad that we did, because it gave the novel a bit more meaning. But everything about this was horribly depressing, and there's one point where one of the characters mentioned that, they could all decide to make better choices, but none of them want to. It was maddening.So I left Love Me Back feeling pretty sad and not like I'd gotten much else out of it. I think that something like this would've worked better as a short story. The novel length suggests that there are going to be more dynamic elements to the plot, or even just a plot in general, both of which Love Me Back lacks. But I really liked its honesty and grittiness, as well as Tierce's ability to portray a lot about Marie's character almost entirely through \"show\" and not \"tell.\""}, {"userName": "Lola G.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31296103-lola-g", "userReview": "I'm giving this book 2 stars because it is well written.

Non c\u2019\u00e8 n\u00e9 apocalisse, n\u00e9 redenzione. \u00c8 il percorso di una donna molto giovane attraverso la propria sofferenza, narrato con voce ingenua e inconsapevole, eppure a tratti lucidissima.\u00c8 una storia di incontri sessuali dove il piacere sessuale \u00e8 assente, con poche eccezioni. Il sesso raccontato non \u00e8 mai eccitante perch\u00e9 da esso trapela sempre il motivo costante dello squallore e dell\u2019autolesionismo. Si potrebbe definire un romanzo antierotico. Lo squallore a cui Marie viene sottoposta \u00e8 quello che lei ricerca con dedizione. Lo fa per annullarsi, anzi; per annullare il dolore con altro dolore. Le numerose figure maschili finiscono sempre per diventare gli aguzzini di Marie, col candore di una totale mancanza di empatia che li caratterizza dal primo all\u2019ultimo.Merritt Tierce evita accuratamente di dare giudizi espliciti. La narrazione potrebbe essere interpretata come un racconto di Marie alla figlia.Qui qualche link a interviste all\u2019autrice, letture interessanti che danno l\u2019idea di che personaggio intenso e onesto sia.http://www.edizionisur.it/sotto-il-vu...http://www.minimaetmoralia.it/wp/disc...http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/opi...Lette queste cose capirete ancora meglio perch\u00e9 Merritt Tierce \u00e8 una persona veramente simpatica, nel senso in cui di solito non si intende la simpatia. Chiarezza, concisione, determinazione nello svelare anche gli aspetti scomodi, quelli con cui la gente non ha nessuna voglia di empatizzare, quelli in cui nessuno si vuole riconoscere; sia quando dice cose sacrosante sull\u2019aborto, sia quando parla della sua scrittura. Micidale l\u2019intervista di Vanni Santoni sul metodo, in cui Tierce esordisce dicendo: \u201cScrivo zero ore al giorno: ecco la verit\u00e0\u201d. Sta rispondendo a una domanda alla quale di solito scrittori e scrittrici reagiscono con una ragionevole spiegazione delle proprie abitudini, della timeline quotidiana per trovare la concentrazione eccetera. Tierce invece dice: \u201cNel tentativo di darmi un metodo ho cercato di creare ogni tipo di spazio per la scrittura, \u00e8 diventata quasi una vera e propria abitudine \u2013 e non ha dato alcun frutto\u201d, continuando con: \u201cLa tragica verit\u00e0 \u00e8 che quando va bene mi ritrovo a scrivere in aereo o in aeroporto, perch\u00e9 sono situazioni in cui non si pu\u00f2 fare nient\u2019altro, se sono in casa mi scopro anche a mettermi a riordinare pur di non scrivere, insomma diciamocelo: sono un modello pessimo per chiunque voglia fare questo mestiere\u201d. In un\u2019altra intervista chiarisce come Carne viva sia un libro ambientato soprattutto in un ristorante, che parla della vita dei camerieri, e che il sesso, la droga etc. facciano parte della vicenda non solo per concretizzare il bisogno autolesionista di Marie, ma anche perch\u00e9 spesso fanno parte dello stile di vita legato a quella particolare professione."}, {"userName": "sof\u00eda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32880768-sof-a", "userReview": "But when you fall asleep I go into the bathroom and do lines off the map of the steer.

I read 70 percent of it in excerpts at work, and on my lunch break; the second I cracked the cover I knew I was going to keep reading until I finished. It's essentially Waiter Rant plus Crank, only without Hopkins' just-say-no agenda. There's no moralizing, just what is, and what is is pretty damn rough sometimes. Not for anyone who doesn't read sex scenes. Side note: Not living in New York or Baltimore or Chicago I don't often get the experience of reading a book set in places I know, and it was fun to see her mention streets I drive down and neighborhoods I know.

The author's writing style is not what I am used to, and she often skips around in time as well as voice. In one chapter she is speaking to her daughter, in another she is just experiencing her life - filled with drugs, sex, and many, many men. I am unsure of the audience. While Marie is a young adult (last year of high school and a few years beyond...I think), I would certainly not categorize this as a young adult book.It is an interesting look into a very upside-down world, and will cause me to think differently about what might be going on in the back of restaurants!"}, {"userName": "Megan Tristao", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6924236-megan-tristao", "userReview": "If you like stories with young, immature, weak, morally questionable narrators who make a string of bad life decisions\u2014running the gamut from alcohol to drugs to illegal behavior at work to relationships, both emotional and sexual\u2014maybe you will like this book.
