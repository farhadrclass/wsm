(Destroy in a good way)It's always amazing to read something that feels like it was written for you. Great stuff. Her politics are right on (so far) -- which is something I haven't ever been able to say, for many reasons, when it comes to art theorists, reviewers, and historians.Having read a lot of art theory/art review/art biographies/etc, I really appreciate Lippard's detailed information accompanying every photo throughout the book. Often times I find myself reading an art book on something/someone that I'm not too familiar with and the example photo (that's supposed to be helpful) doesn't link up or is completely out of context -- that's frustrating! Lippard doesn't do this and from what I can tell, this use of information caption with photo is something she includes in many of her books."}, {"userName": "Kusuma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/316302-kusuma", "userReview": "You pretty much can't lose with a profound discourse on feminist art."}, {"userName": "Tatiana Gonzalez", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6784-tatiana-gonzalez", "userReview": "eve ensler's lecture has whipped me into a feminist frenzy! grrr"}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4327177-kay", "userReview": "An incredibly important book.

Lippard, author of the highly original and popular Mixed Blessings, merged her art-world concerns with those of the then-fledgling women\u2019s movement. In a career that spans sixteen books and scores of articles, catalogs, and essays on art, political activism, feminism, and multiculturalism, her engaging and provocative writings have heralded a new way of thinking about art and its role in the feminist movement.This new collection of previously published essays covers more than two decades of Lippard\u2019s thinking on the ever-evolving definitions of feminist art, the convergence of high and low art, political and activist art, and the contributions of feminist theory to the politics of identity that infuses the production and exhibition of much of today\u2019s fine and popular art.With a new introduction from the author, The Pink Glass Swan brings together selections from two of Lippard\u2019s leading works, From the Center: Feminist Essays on Art and Get the Message?: A Decade of Art for Social Change, and numerous other articles written for newspapers, magazines, and art catalogs across the country.", "title": "The Pink Glass Swan: Selected Essays on Feminist Art", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/155917.The_Pink_Glass_Swan", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328752363l/155917.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45691.Lucy_R_Lippard", "name": "Lucy R.
