It was very good. Hope Angel and Spike will be able to become friends one day.Can't wait to read more Buffyverse novels!!!!"}, {"userName": "Brit", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19527396-brit", "userReview": "3.5 stars in truth but seeing as how Goodreads doesn't have half stars its 3 stars officially. This book is middle of the road for me. I love the scense that take place in the 19th century and with Spike and Lyanka and Spike and Angel. But the individual scense of the two not so much. And despite how I wish the story went the part I really like only took up about 1/3 of the book or even alittle less. And Angel as a whole was a bit to nervious, whinny, and anxsious for my liking. And Spike was stupid obsessive about Buffy. So the problem with the characters and their story arks that make up 2/3 of the book just over shadowed the flashback scense that were magic. And Spike and Lyanka banter that was sarcastic and playful. So it could surpass a middle of the road read for me, despite my utter love for certain part."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5898930-emma", "userReview": "It's great to see characters crossing over in the novels as well as in the TV series and I've always thought Spike was an amazing character. The scenes with him and Angel in are also good as their shared history and similar circumstances, not drinking human blood albeit for different reasons, add friction to what could otherwise be a boring pairing. I especially like being able to learn more about Angelus' history and the dynamic between him and Spike as they both fought to be the baddest vamps in town. An excellent addition to the Buffyverse by Odom."}, {"userName": "Amanda McDonald", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9203646-amanda-mcdonald", "userReview": "I didn't like this one at first, but as I started reading it, it grew on me. I am not a fan of Spike and I found him annoying, even in the flashbacks. All in all it was a decent book, but I definitely like more Buffy in my Buffy/Angel crossovers. While there was mention of her and she was in one quick phone call, that was it. It should have been called Spike/Angel. I did like the flashbacks. It's always interesting to me when the writers create these back stories that we kind of know from the show/comics, but they put their own spin on them."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151796-kathleen", "userReview": "This is the absolute worst media tie-in novel I've ever read associated with any TV or movie fandom EVER. I'm a huge fan of the characters who are central to this story, but there's something about its tone that is just awful. I'm not even sure it's the author's fault. There's just something off about its premise and pacing. I suspect he was given a bizarre story outline and couldn't really do anything with it."}, {"userName": "bluetyson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15473-bluetyson", "userReview": "isbn,original"}], "description": "ANGEL VS.
