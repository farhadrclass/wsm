The story had the potential to be cute and quirky but because of the whiny-Mary Sue-judgy-bitchy heroine it was a bloody chore to read and if it hasn't already been made clear - I didn't enjoy it AT ALL. I hated the main character, Julie - she was boring, pathetic and shrewish. Even though the silly cow was seventeen, she'd never had a boyfriend or even been kissed properly before, all because she was waiting for a boy she'd not seen since she was six years old!! Who the hell falls in love when they're six years old? And who the hell bloody stays in love for over 10 yrs with a boy they haven't seen or talked to for a decade?! It's fucking ridiculous and it showed how dumb Julie was.Julie was unbelievably irritating, she acted like a grandma instead of a teenager, I'm guessing I was meant to find her strict and goody two shoes personality charming but she was fucking annoying. I hated the way she looked down at everyone and how she thought she was better than everyone else \u2014 she believed all the other girls were shallow, stupid and superficial and not worth her time. She made no effort to get to know them but she was all for getting cozy with the guys..Ugh, the sexist bitch.Oh and she was also a clumsy idiot, she couldn't go anywhere without tripping or falling over like a fool.The love interest Jason was supposed to be funny and charming but he came across as annoying and immature. I didn't buy that he liked Julie when he was constantly lying to her and humiliating her. He spent most of his time either out right ignoring her or hanging out with his ex girlfriend and his other friends\u2026 even though he knew that Julie had no-one else to chill with. His 'feelings' for her didn't come across as strong or genuine \u2014 she's just another girl that he'll end up dating for a little while and then dumping when he finds someone better.Pretty much all the female characters were portrayed as dumb, mean, shallow bitches. Only Pheobe came across as half decent but she was barely in it.A disappointing read \u2014 the plot fell flat, the heroine was vile and the romance was bloody awful."}, {"userName": "Aj the Ravenous Reader", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30248594-aj-the-ravenous-reader", "userReview": "3.5 stars An adventurous, hilarious romantic story about a too smart, know-it-all, self-righteous Julia who wishes to find her MTB (Meant to Be) while on an educational tour around London when she was paired up (for \u201cacademic\u201d purposes) with her least favorite person- a carefree, troublemaker, jerk-blooded Jason who seems intent on ruining all her carefully laid out plans.I wasn\u2019t a big fan of Julia in the beginning because I thought she was too smug but I soon realized all her \u201cI\u2019m better than everybody else\u201d act is just her insecurities in careful disguise and eventually, I warmed up to her character. Like she said, \u201cshe\u2019s not being mean, she\u2019s just descriptive.\u201d Lol.The entire story is so much fun and I love that it\u2019s set in London. Julia just cracked me up with her imaginative descriptions and general awkwardness and Jason although was unpredictable and annoying half of the time was also surprisingly adorable the remaining half. Unavoidably, predictability and clich\u00e9s are to be expected since it\u2019s YA romance, ergo, the required eye rolls but since I laughed way more than the number of times I rolled my eyes, flaws are mostly forgiven. This is my first book from the author but now I\u2019m eyeing her Being Sloane Jacobs with obvious malicious intent."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "Meant to Be was entirely too cute! It was sweet, wacky, and fun, with a sweet romance a-brewing. Julia is taking a class trip to London. A dream-trip, in Julia\u2019s opinion, without parents, and as she says an \u201citinerary full of visits to places I\u2019ve only read about or imagined.\u201d Unfortunately for Julia, her trip \u201cbuddy\u201d she\u2019s assigned to is none other than the wisecracking, never-serious, and highly irritating Jason. They are basically stuck together like glue, and he is the complete opposite to her. She has the entire trip planned out with guidebooks filled with post-it notes, while he\u2019s more of the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type of guy. She follows the rules, he breaks them. Really, a nightmare of a buddy in her opinion\u2026..at first.Jason is nothing like what she envisions as her Meant To Be, or MTB, someone who is perfect for her in every way. Julia has it in her mind that Mark, a close childhood friend who\u2019s just moved back to her neighborhood, could her MTB. She remembers their fake wedding when they were five, and when she turned six he gave her a baggie full of yellow Starburst for her birthday, fished out of several packages. He remembered it was her favorite flavor. Then there\u2019s Chris, a mysterious boy she met at a party who keeps texting sweet things to her. Julia was so ordered and well-behaved, worrying about grades and following the rules. It\u2019s funny how when a tightly wound girl breaks the rules, she REALLY breaks the rules. I may or may not know a thing or two about that, *ahem* Anyhow, moving on, Jason gets Julia to let her hair down a bit, to do the unexpected, and she slowly starts to see another side to Jason. She has fun with him. Maybe he\u2019s not just the shallow prankster she\u2019s always thought he was. But Jason\u2019s hot and cold with her, one minute Julia thinks they\u2019re becoming friends, and the next Jason\u2019s ignoring her. But then they share some moments where sparks are definitely flying and she\u2019s more confused than ever. Here\u2019s a bit of spark to tempt you: \n\u201cLet me up!\u201d I scream, trying to wriggle out from underneath him. But he doesn\u2019t. And then something changes and I realize Jason\u2019s lying on top of me, staring at me, and his lips are inches from my lips, and there is rain dripping off his hair, curling it around his ears, running down onto my neck. My heart pounds and I feel the tingle starting in my toes again. Jason drops his phone in the grass and uses the free hand to brush a fat, wet curl out of my eyes\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nI\u2019ll leave it to your imagination from there. ;)This story was predictable in parts but it was so utterly sweet, I didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s what I wanted to happen anyhow! There was a lot of adorable humor stemming from Julia and Jason\u2019s total klutziness, making a lot of scenes madcap fun. Reading this seriously made me want to visit London. Julia and Jason visit touristy places like the Tower of London, the London Eye, and the famous Shakespearean theater, the Globe, making them sound so wonderful, I felt like I was touring London with them. When I finished Meant To Be, I couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cawww sooo sweet,\u201d *sigh*. A vanilla queen\u2019s dream.

I spent a good deal of the book either grinning stupidly or laughing out loud. Yes, it was a bit cliche, and there were parts that were a bit cheesy, but there's that fun, sweet innocence of \"I'm five years old, and I like you, so I'm going to pick on you\" type of romance. And I'm usually good about figuring out things early on, but ooooh, I can't believe Morrill snuck that one by me. This was definitely one of those books that just leave you smiling in the end."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3736122-katie", "userReview": "Similar Books: Flirting in Italian by Lauren Henderson, Anna & the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins, The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight by Jennifer E. SmithI put off reading this book for quite a while because (1) I thought I was over contemps and (2) I had high expectations for this book's greatness and was afraid I'd be disappointed. I now have no idea why I was so worried - this book was everything I was hoping it'd be and SO. MUCH. MORE.If I had to sum up my feelings for this book, I'd say I'm like...And...There are basically 3 elements that will make me go crazy and fangirl over a book. I like to call them the \"3 F's,\" and this book has them all. It's funny, fluffy, and foreign.First and foremost, this book is hilarious. I loved Julia as a narrator. People go around talking about this nebulous concept of \"voice\" and how it's so important for an author to have. Sometimes, it's hard to tell if an author has a good one or not, whether it's distinctive. But I'm just gonna say this: Lauren Morrill has a great voice! And it's absolutely perfect for this genre.Something that kept me from loving Anna & the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins was the fact that I didn't much care for Anna. I didn't connect with her or her voice. But there's just so much to love about Julia. She's quirky and nerdy and basically 100% adorable.And can I just say that this book is FULL of awkward.But in a totally wonderful way. Julia literally football tackles someone in the middle of the Tate Museum. I had to re-read that passage to double-check that I hadn't made that up. Julia just gets herself into so many incredibly awkward, hilarious circumstances that you can't help but root for her.Now. Let's talk about one of the best parts of the book. Jason Erm...I mean, the romance.The cuteness, it killed me. Julia and Jason are just SO FREAKIN' CUTE TOGETHER! I loved their banter and how perfectly imperfect Jason is. Also, he's a ginger, which was totally unexpected and basically made me love him. I mean, how many redhead heroes are there in YA? Not many. And the fact that he's SO immature could have been off-putting, but I couldn't stop laughing at his antics. He reminded me of the funny guys in high school that you always liked but never dated because you were too busy crushing on the football star or the one in a band.Thank you, Lauren Morrill, for helping score a point for the funny guy!I also really liked that the romance felt very real and honest. Jason doesn't always say the right thing, and Julia has to lose a lot of her naivety about relationships before she can be happy. And while I was afraid going into the book that the romance would feel rushed because the book takes place over only 1 week, it never did. There's no dropping of the l-word, which was great, and really, Julia and Jason were just great together.2012 has really been a year of contemps for me, and this is definitely one of my favorites. It might very well be my favorite book of the year period, tied with Wanderlove by Kirsten Hubbard.More books like this please!"}, {"userName": "mahana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29601169-mahana", "userReview": "1.5 starsCan we boycott teenage girls that think they're better than everyone else because they read classic novels and listen to the Beatles?

However, it ended up completely surprising me. This book is up there in the ranks with Stephanie Perkins for me...I feel like Perkins fans will absolutely love & adore this book. It didn't take me long to be completely sucked into the story, and I read the entire thing in one day. The author just NAILED IT with this book, and there is so much about it that I loved. It was exactly what I needed and had been craving, so it was a completely satisfying read for me.The characters were fantastic, and I especially loved the main character, Julia. Her and I, we are soul sisters. The slight mystery aspect of the book was totally unexpected, but added SO MUCH to the story - it was like the perfect amount of icing on top of an already baked-to-perfection-cupcake. If you are a fan of contemporary romance, pick this up, because it is a fantastic one. I feel like this book is grossly underrated, which makes me sad. Also, this book was just an all around absolute blast, and it had me wanting to get to London for a vacation ASAP.I can't wait to get my hands on the author's next book!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4844873-laura", "userReview": "Do you believe in meant to be?Are we meant to fall in love with one particular person?

Come on, jump on the tour bus! Meet Jason and Julia, complete opposite personalities that cause havoc and adventure all around London. Things I loved about Meant to Be...Jason and London.Jason could be the most realistic boy written for young adult fiction. He was frustrating, immature, sweet, and hilarious. And by the end, I adored him. His freckles, grin, and jump into life attitude made me smile and laugh. The trouble that boy could create! *shakes head* Haha...But then he would turn around and do the sweetest thing. The way he could show his feelings one minute and then cover them up the next drove me crazy AND \u201cawww\u201d all over the place. I want to say more, but really you just have to experience the chemistry, warmth, and surprises for yourself. Both Jason and London offer a world of surprises. London! London came alive on the pages in pubs, tourist attractions, and weather. London has always been on my list of must get to cities. This book made me want to jump on a jet plane. Right now!You will probably see a big plot point coming a mile away, but you won\u2019t mind though. I didn\u2019t. I just enjoyed the back and forth jabs, ease, and flirting between Jason and Julia as they explored London.Hope you meet Jason and Julia soon.

This book. So cute. I read this in one sitting (well, really I was on my bed). I sat down, started reading, and didn\u2019t stop until it was over. I genuinely cannot see why someone would not like this book. It\u2019s in LONDON, for crying out loud! I very much approved. This book is right up there with Anna and the French Kiss and The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight. Really, it\u2019s like the Holy Trinity (that\u2019s not sacrilegious, right?).Anyway, what I really loved about this book is the humor. It\u2019s hilarious, right from the get-go. Our heroine, Julia, is sitting in her airplane seat going on about all the different things she hates (which include gum-wielding children, planes, and Jason Lippincott).Oh yeah. That reminds me. Jason. Tr\u00e8s yummy. Really. (But in a non-creepy/stalker kind of way. Seriously.)Here\u2019s the equation:Julia(But she swims!)+Jason(But he sings and plays the guitar!)=You get the idea. Julia gets saddled with Jason for her trip \u201cbuddy\u201d. And if you\u2019ve read any kind of YA novel recently, you probably know exactly where this is going, but I swear the interaction between these characters is very funny, and at times, pretty sweet.This book is pretty heavy on the character development, which I love, since I don\u2019t see enough of it these days. I was especially surprised since this is Morrill\u2019s debut novel. She certainly has insight into showing emotion without, like, telling it.Julia was a pretty cool character. I liked that despite her being very set in her ways she was willing to try new things (although it\u2019s likely that was because of Jason). And the thing I really liked about Julia was that she was aware of her flaws and actually tried to do something about it\u2014most of the time anyway. It isn\u2019t very long before she starts breaking her carefully placed rules, after all. And Jason was adorable. I\u2019m pretty confident I would not mind having a boyfriend like him. At all. Although one thing I didn\u2019t like about him was that he really jerked Julia around sometimes. At first it was amusing but then it just got annoying. I know he\u2019s a poor confused teenage boy who doesn\u2019t know how to express his feelings, but come on. Act like a decent human being. Julia wasn\u2019t a saint either, though. She would just go from one guy to the next, practically on whimsy. Mark, Chris, Jason, Mark, Chris, Jason (this literally happened in the book). I just wanted to be like \u201cPICK ONE already!\u201d It made her seem pretty shallow at times. And I also wished she would have stood up for herself more when she wanted to see certain sights, especially since some of them had personal meaning for her. But characters would be boring (and unrealistic) if they were perfect, so I think these flaws work for the plot. They\u2019re only high school juniors. And the ending was cute and funny, and ultimately satisfying.I\u2019ve been super looking forward to this book and it didn\u2019t disappoint. I really recommend that you read it!"}, {"userName": "Anatea Oroz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183325-anatea-oroz", "userReview": "This review is also posted on my blog, Anatea's Bookshelf.\nI have wanted to read Meant To Be ever since I saw this beautiful cover (I'm a sucker for pretty covers, but then, who isn't?) The second reason why I really wanted to read this book was the setting. London is my favorite city in the world, and every book that is happening there will be in my hands eventually. The third reason why I wanted to read Meant To Be is because it just seemed like a perfect cute read. You get that feeling where you just have to read the book! Something was telling me that I'm going to enjoy this one.Dad was right. Screw Paris; London is the city for me.Julia and her classmates are going on a school trip to London, but Julia's best friend and friends from her swimming team weren't able to come which leaves Julia with people she doesn't particularly hang out with. To make the trip even worse, she gets paired up with Jason, a guy who is the total opposite from her. While she is a stuck-up-goody-two-shoes, Jason is relaxed and he does what he wants, whenever he wants. Which also means, regularly rules breaking. The week they spent in London together was so cute! I loved reading about their interactions, their adventures and the time they spent together. You could see that they liked each other, but Julia was oblivious to that. In her mind, she only saw Mark, her childhood friend, her MTB (meant to be). I was so anxious for the moment when she finally realizes how awesome Jason is, and what a douche Mark is (this is not really a spoiler). Another thing why I liked this book so much is the similarities I have with it. I also went on a school trip with my classmates to London, and we did the exact same things they did! We visited the Tate Museum, we rode on London Eye, we went to Piccadilly Circus, to Globe theater, to Stratford-upon-Avon... Lauren described all those things so vividly, that even if you never actually were there, you got that the feeling that you were there, and for me, it was like reliving one of the best memories I have.When I finally finished the book, I was grinning for the next few hours. I just couldn't stop. That ending was just too cute! Lauren Morrill definitely got on my list of authors whose books I read no matter what.

It's been a long time since last time I wrote review. Work, stress and, honestly, I've been into different kind of books since last summer. Well, it looks like I am again in sweet young adult novels phase. And what great book to start with.  Meant to Be goes in my special category - summer books. Light, fun reads about summer, road-trips, unexpected love, testing friendships and growing up. Books that make me think about warm nights spent outside with friends, ice-cream and chips we used to eat, boys on bikes and skates ( I don't ride, but I had this really soft spot for boys that do - one of them being my man), shorts and flip-flops, highlights in my hair... \"Paris was a city of love for unimaginative folks.\" This is perfect choice for everyone who read and loved Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins - London, Shakespeare and love, what's not to like? I know, that was Paris, The City of Love, but you might change your mind after you read this. I've noticed that some readers didn't like Julia that much, but I think she is something different. Maybe that's just my inner adult-romance-for-the-last-six-months reader, maybe I would find 101 reason to rant about her if I read this book just few days ago when I was in weird book funk, but now I can say just this - Julia is great girl. One of the reasons why I think that? Shakespeare. No, it's not because I'm teacher. I had similar introduction to his plays like Julia and I've spend good part of my teen years obsessing over them. Until this day no one in my family knows for sure how that book ended on our bookshelf. I'll just go with the flow and say... It was meant to be.:)\"I was just hoping that you'd realize that guys like me, go with girls like you.\" If you enjoy reading about sweet first love, you are going to devour this book in one sitting. Jason and Julia have this perfect chemistry, at first it looks like they have nothing in common, but just wait. Jason will make you fall on your knees and make silly, googly eyes. Scene in the skate park, in his room and there is one part that made me laugh so hard because it reminded me of all kinky books I've read.  Don't waste your time and go find this book and read it.

I was still in the middle of a fantastic series when I started this, but I convinced myself that I wouldn't be able to handle an emotionally exhausting read during a weekend that's supposed to be about getting some rest and relaxation. This seemed like the perfect fit, but I ended up thinking about that other book the entire time.In addition to the distracted mind, I was also comparing this to an all-time favourite of mine. Maybe the similarities ended with the foreign country and the OCD heroine, but reviews of this book often likened the two and THAT book was full of cute and adorbs while this one was... not.The premise was promising. Julia is a rule-follower who believes in having an MTB, a meant-to-be person who's the perfect guy for her. She thinks it's Mark, her childhood crush whom she \"married\" when she was five, but ever since Mark moved away and came back last year, she's been invisible girl. Presently, she's on the trip of her dreams, a school excursion to London, where her parents (the ultimate MTBs) went for their honeymoon. She's got her pocket Shakespeare in her bag and a luggageful of guidebooks ready. Her itinerary is set and she's determined to have the best nine days in the city of her dreams. However, her plans fall through when she is assigned to be trip buddies with Jason, the obnoxious class troublemaker. He's everything Mark is not - immature, idiotic and a complete rule-breaker. The plot was predictable, but I was hoping that the location, the narration and the characters' personalities would still deliver an entertaining read. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past Julia's holier-than-thou attitude and Jason's childish antics. I tried to be patient and forgiving since they're kids but their constant bickering made them seem more like 12-year-olds than the 16-year-olds they were. Jason was the slightly better character of the two and he described Julia best when he said this to her:\n\n\"Haven't you spent most of this trip thinking that all your classmates are shallow horndogs who couldn't appreciate the history and literature of London if it kicked them in the teeth?\"\n\nSo you know how it ends. Boy teaches girl to lighten up. Girl teaches flirty boy about love and they end up falling for each other. The transition from extreme dislike to sudden love was also choppy and unrealistic. The only thing that kept me from completely hating this was the surprise twist at the end and the few swoontastic moves by Jason. Other than that it was just okay for me. But as I've said, maybe it was just poor timing. I've seen other readers say they couldn't stop smiling the moment they began this so maybe it's just me. *shrug*"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3212850-elizabeth", "userReview": "Review + Interview here on my blog!This is a book that took me by utter surprise. I was thinking that I would be reading a cute contemporary novel. I hadn't read the description or even heard what it was about. You see, I met Lauren twice before I even thought about requesting it on NetGalley. If her book is as awesome as she is, it has GOT to be a good read.Let's talk about the book. I was surprised at how much I was like Julia in high school, minus the grades. She's a stickler for rules and MAPS. Oh my gosh, maps are so important. There were times when this got in the way of a true London adventure, and that's when Jason steps in. How much do I love Jason? I love him a lot. Like, he's up there with Augustus Waters. We meet him as this class clown kind of character, and as we move along through the story, we get to know more about him. I need to point out that he doesn't change. He doesn't go from being class clown to the guy who spouts bits of poetry and history when only Julia is listening. He is both. I seriously could shed a tear for how beautiful his character is. Oh, especially with the super awesome amazing twist at the end. It's one of those that will make you shoot out of your chair and yell, \"NO WAY!\" at 2am. Oh, just me? Oh\u2026 Okay.There were some AMAZINGLY WRITTEN LINES. Well, the whole book is so good, but oh, there are some things that Jason says that are so A+. And when Julia has her epiphanies after being wrapped around the axle about the whole \"meant to be\" issue and the boys issue and the\u2026 Okay, she's a worrier. But I have felt some of the same things she's felt, so there were times when I was crying with her. Not TFiOS cries by any means, but I just\u2026 When you have felt those same things, it's like finding a new friend to confide in. Seriously, this book. It makes me want more from this author as soon as possible!Overall, this book was pretty freakin' spectacular. Holy wow, as Julia would say!

Even if it doesn't feel okay for a long time, or even if it feels like things will never be okay again, everything works out in the end.\u201d\nI don't particularly loved this book, like it was just okay for me, though some parts we're good.1) I really didn't like the protagonist. Like seriously, Julia... In love with THREE guys? How's that EVEN possible? I don't call this love, I call this having a crush on somebody. It made me feel like Lauren Morrill, the author, didn't quit understand the mind of a feminine reader. I think a lot of people can agree with me: it's not because you love reading romantic books that you completely forget how love works in real life. We're not stupid girls who fall in love with every guy how treats her well. I really disliked this part of the book, I'm sorry but for me, the character of Julia was just a lot of crap. Also, I couldn't care if she got hurt, if she got her true love, if anything. I didn't care at all for her, which isn't really how you're supposed to feel about the main character, right? Oh, and also, she's so slooooow like come on! After a whole damn book, she's like \"Oh wait, am I actually in love with Jason? BUT... what about my MTB???\" My god she's so stupid, MTB's don't exist and surely not when your \"MTB\" is some guy you haven't spoken to FOR YEARS. Geez. Sorry, I just hate her so much. And by the way, Julia, could you please stop pretending like you're better than everyone else? That's so annoying.2) So why did I still enjoyed the book? Because Jason. Oh my god I loved him so much, he's just so much fun, he's ridiculous yet adorable yet annoying yet amazing. I really loved him as a character and for me, he was the one who made the book enjoyable.3) What I also liked was the fact that it all took place in London. It's a city I've been to when I was young so I don't remember anything about it, but it's somewhere I really want to go back. I think Lauren Morrill did a very good job at describing the city, you can see that she made a lot of effort by searching information about museums, about every places she mentions in the book really."}, {"userName": "Beyza", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31982971-beyza", "userReview": "San\u0131r\u0131m, \u00e7ok da b\u00fcy\u00fck bir beklentiyle ba\u015flamad\u0131\u011f\u0131m i\u00e7in sevdim.Ayr\u0131ca kitab\u0131n T\u00fcrk\u00e7e ad\u0131 iyi uyarlanm\u0131\u015f ;DBir de ben de\u011fi\u015fik yerler ke\u015ffettirebilen kitaplar\u0131 seviyorum.

Its cute buts also its literary every romance cliche in existence stuffed into a book.Its a good plot, but SO predictable with everything that happens.It has nice characters, but at the same time they are so overdone. The pacing was good, but at the same time there was always something missing. Its just... a strange book in a way. Its not bad. Its actually pretty good. But it could be so much better if the author wouldn't have tried so very, very hard to try to be funny at every turn. I mean you can only tumble, stumble or fall into stuff so often before it just gets annoying. yes we get it the main characters is a bit of a klutz. Thanks. And since i am already talking about her, lets continue on with her. I LOVED her at the beginning. I loved that she was so organised. That she loved to read. That she was exited to go on a school trip to LEARN. To experience something she might never get another chance to do. I love that she plans out everything, that she loves guide books and maps and plans and informational templets! I love that she organises everything a specific way. She loves rules and tries to follow them as best as she can because... (well i can guess that it makes her feel better and save and just sure of how things will go because RULES!)I CAN RELATE!And it was BEAUTIFUL to see it in a character. Sadly not even three chapters into the book that side of the character kind of just... got dropped?We got very small little mentioned two or three times through the rest (most) of the book but that specific version of this character we where introduced to at the start? PUFF! She was gone. And i HATED that. Why give me this great character and than just... change her completely?Make her into something so different that it makes no real sense at all?I don't understand the complete and very, very strange and unexplained and unexplainable switch she went through. How can you love plans and schedules and the next second you have no problem with doing everything spontaneous? IT DOES NOT WORK LIKE THAT!Even if someone that really does love plans lets them drop for a little while, lets face it planners will always get back to what they know and love!Okay.... lets end this rant!I didn't like how Morrill made a great and different female main character only to completely change her so specific characteristics after just a handful of pages. Why even start her out like that than????Also how FAN-freaking- TASTIC does Jason has to look (or smell, maybe? Who knows? Maybe he has some kind of bewitching odor that makes every female go crazy!) to be that loved by every female in smelling range of him?He is describe to run around in ripped jeans, old t-shirts and baseball cap. And while i personally don't have anything against that look i also don't necessary look after guys that run around like that ... maybe i am an exception. Possibly. Could be. I didn't get it but okay. I really didn't like the complete idiotic romantic notions in this book and how the romance was build up in this book. I HATED that the main female -lets remember the well planed out and logical and rational person from the first few pages!- is apparently someone that believes completely in finding the perfect one person that everyone has out there. There were just a good amount of completely frustrating moments in this book that made me actual and really angry. Can't explain it really. But the mixture of stupidly behaving hormonally driving teenagers and overused cliches just didn't sit that great with me. Still overall this book isn't bad. Its just not what i wanted it to be. And sadly i saw a lot of potential but it just felt way too forced in so many ways, too overdone and just way to much like trying too hard to be something it just wasn't that it wasn't better than an \"okay i read that....\" kind of book for me."}, {"userName": "Chesca", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35614518-chesca", "userReview": "[Julia and Jason ended up with each other.

I\u2019ve been meaning to read this book for ages as it\u2019s been recommended to me by numerous people so I\u2019m glad that I can cross it off my list and now say that I too enjoyed it! The story follows Julia and her high school class who are traveling to London for a week during the year to absorb the culture but sadly her best friend is unable to attend. She gets stuck being paired with an obnoxious and immature classmate named Jason and from the moment they get on the plane until the very end, hilarity ensues.Meant to Be features a slow burn love / hate romance (my favorite!) but the pacing of the events in the story feel action packed. Throughout the trip, our main character Julia is juggling several men while she sorts out her feelings, something she\u2019s never had to do before and it shows. She can be annoying at times (she\u2019s your typical overachieving know-it-all) but she also has a much softer side that believes in everyone having an MTB (or meant to be). Her partner Jason is one of the most immature YA guys I\u2019ve ever read about and I could easily relate to her frustrations about him. Julia is such a rigid rule follower that a free spirit like Jason often clashes with her in most situations. The one thing I found slightly unbelievable were all of the awkward moments Julia found herself in. It just seemed like too much to happen to one person but despite all of her faults, I found myself rooting for her.My favorite part of this book was exploring London with Julia and Jason. Lauren Morrill makes the reader feel as though they\u2019re also a first time tourist which is something I hadn\u2019t been expecting. They visited a ton of historical sites (such as Stratford-Upon-Avon, The Globe Theater, The London Eye and even Harrod\u2019s) that I\u2019ve always been dying to see but they also spent time during their trip doing several offbeat things which enhanced their cultural experience even further. I found the overall plot to be predictable but it didn\u2019t at all take away from the enjoyment I felt while reading the story. I love witnessing character growth, especially when the main character is an uptight person who\u2019s thrusted out of their comfort zone (and even more especially when said character is experiencing that growth in a place like London). Julia modeled her dream relationship off that of her parents and I loved that comparison throughout the story. Since Julia is away and doesn\u2019t have a ton of access to phone calls she really has to rely on herself to sort out her beliefs and the way she chooses to act which I really appreciated.Final Thoughts: Meant to Be by Lauren Morrill is a darling contemporary novel perfect for anyone looking to lose themselves in a slow burn romance. It\u2019s also ideal for anyone with a case of wanderlust because traveling through London in Morrill\u2019s words is so vivid that it\u2019ll leave you feeling like you\u2019re on a vacation of your own. The plot of the novel is predictable but it\u2019s everything the description and cover promise to be- swoony, engaging and fun!"}], "description": "It's one thing to fall head over heels into a puddle of hazelnut coffee, and quote another to fall for the - gasp - wrong guy.
