He seems overshadowed by his other contemporaries, i.e. the Canadian pantheon: Atwood, Munroe, Richler, Davies, Laurence. Because he was much else - an actor, a critic, I think also a broadcaster? - his writing competes with his other selves. He deserves wider readership, which seems to be something I say every time I review one of his books. Partly, that's a \"note to self\" - Jen, fer god's sake, why haven't you read EVERYTHING this guy has written by now? And partly, it's because - other than Karen (who lists it as one of her favourites) - none of my GR friends seem to have read this novel.Ok, well, it's probably not for everyone - you need to like sprawling, multi-generational family sagas. You need to like compelling characters, high drama, the exploration of inner and outer conflict anchored by a specific time and place.So if you do, put this on your to-read list. Go ahead. Right now. I'll wait.If you've not yet read any Findley, this is a good one to start with, as it seems 'core' Findley to me. An epic, sprawling story with a central figure - Lily - who struggles with her many demons and is the bright and central spark (heh) of life around which the entire novel revolves. Her son Charlie, the narrator, whose main quest is to know the identity of his father. A Toronto-centric story, focused on the Rosedale set and their particular quirks and cruelties (don't let this discourage you - it is not so place-specific to be inaccessible). Wartime setting mirroring the inner conflicts. Families and traditional roles - and people pushing those boundaries. Mothers and sons. OH - how we have mothers and sons! Secrets. Illness, mental and otherwise. Fire - as an event; as a motif. Music - an occupation, an avocation, a calling, a uniting theme, a scene-setter, a metaphor. Lots and lots and lots of STORY in this story. I just love family epics that start with a particular set of people, whom you get to know and love; and then take you through successive generations, whom you meet and grow to love too. This one, like many family sags, is roughly linear, but also cumulative (so you don't have the jarring grief inevitable when the story moves on to the next generation of characters). If you want a story where you are completely *invested* in the characters, this is it. There is much empathy here: with few exceptions, every character is 'lost' in some way. You have, like Lily, a desire to save each one; to connect with them and protect them from their essential loneliness.Here, we have Eliza and James - Ede and Tom - Lily and Lizzie and ? (the ? is the novel's central question, although in some ways also its denouement) - Charlie - Ada and Neddy. More, brothers, uncles, half-sisters, friends - each grouping fully conceptualized with a particular drama at the centre; each worthy of their own novel probably. They weave in and out of each other's lives like melody and harmony - break apart and come together again - with Lily being the chorus to whom we always return.There is a suggestion of something bigger, something almost magical at play - as intimated on the back cover pull quote: \"You were always there, Charlie--just the way I was always there myself and all of us, long before the visible parts of our lives began.\"That too is Findley-ish: something subtly supernatural. Some spiritual, mystical connection - some oneness that cuts across time, place, social class. Lily's beloved ants and their greetings (I won't give more away than this) - is a sweet and touching expression of this theme. There are so many reasons to love this book, but I see I've only been circling around the central one: Lily herself. I won't spoil it, because after all, you've all now got this on your to-read list, but Lily is remarkable. Damaged but strong; unique, lovely, heartbreaking. The cruelty she is subjected to - seeing it through 'her' eyes (actually, her son's eyes on her behalf) will last with you. So sad. A true tragic figure, from the beginning. You can't take your eyes off of her - and Charlie won't let you.If there is a flaw to be found here (and I may still go back and up this to a five, but I have been altogether too generous with my rankings lately): Charlie as narrator intrudes a little too often explaining why he knows what he knows - how it was documented; what conversations he had and how he is able to tell the story of his mother's life in such intimate detail. Perhaps I am a naive reader, but this caused me to think about the novel's structure in a way that distanced me from the otherwise completely compelling story. An engrossing, wonderful novel."}, {"userName": "Lorraine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/573080-lorraine", "userReview": "What I found most intriguing about this book is it's narration. As a whole, it is narrated by the grandson of the \"Piano Man\" but he tells the story based on what he learned from his (grandson's) grandmother and mother (the title character) and his own observations. So the story really spans three generations. I can't articulate what it was about this book that made me enjoy it. I chalk it up to a well-written and unique story with interesting characters. It's not difficult reading by any means, but it's not light and fluffy, either. It's literature! :)"}, {"userName": "Sara Norquay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1263824-sara-norquay", "userReview": "For those who like historical fiction about families with a skeleton in the closet this book will not disappoint. The three generation drama is set in Ontario, Canada and begins during the early part of the 20th century. How various characters react to the inherited madness of the person referred to in the title makes it is hard to put the book down. The beautiful writing creates time and space for the illumination of the reader's own understanding of family values."}, {"userName": "Caleigh", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4999962-caleigh", "userReview": "I started reading this a couple of weeks ago, but partway through got to a section that I found a little too disturbing for my taste ... seeming to foreshadow something rather \"Flowers in the Attic\"-ish ... so I set it aside. I'm relieved to report that while there were misdeeds done, they were nothing of this magnitude and I was able to finish the book without shutting my eyes or skipping ahead.\nThe Piano Man's Daughter\n is the fifth or sixth Findley book I've read, and probably the third to involve mental illness as a key theme. I wasn't able to come up with a reason for his fascination with the subject (in my quick Googling) -- except to say that he was heavily influenced by Jungian psychology -- but it's certainly something he has a unique handle on, and his empathy for characters with such issues is remarkable. He portrays the mentally ill almost as though they have a gift, rather than a handicap, but is always starkly realistic about their challenges and their fates.I love that many of Findley's novels are set in Toronto, and the fact that this was set in turn-of-the-20th-Century Toronto made it all the more interesting to me. My own father-in-law was born around the same time as Lily's son, likewise to an unwed mother, who unfortunately was not able to keep him for more than a few years before he became a ward of the system (such that it was). This book helped me to better understand the social mores of the time, and what it must have been like to be considered \"different\" or \"unwanted\" in the Toronto of that day.This wasn't my favourite Findley novel but very enjoyable. I've noticed that there was a film adaptation but I don't think I'll watch it. Stockard Channing as Lily?

It's a lyrical tale of a young piano tuner's search for his past, beautifully told in a series of back stories that the reader must piece together with the narrator.

This is a truly marvelous book."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222213-dianne", "userReview": "This novel was a little slow starting but once it got going it was fascinating. I found it a bit muddled at first, what with the switching back and forth from one time period to another and from one character's life to another. Written with a detachment that it took awhile to get used to, it was a strong story once I got adapted to the style and got everybody sorted out. Somewhere in Section Two, I was hooked.I must confess that I have started making lists of characters as I read so that I won't forget who they are and how they are related to the story. This can be looked at in two ways: 1. I'm getting old and forgetful and am more easily confused. 2. I've become more organized and efficient and am taking my reading more seriously. I choose the second theory. If you think the first is more accurate, please leave me to my delusions; they are all I have left. But I digress...The \"Daughter\" referred to in the title is Lily, daughter of Tom, who is the \"Piano Man\". Lily suffers with mental illness, a condition that has plagued her since childhood and that never lets her live a normal life with her son Charlie. Raised by her mother, Edith, who tried to give her daughter as normal a life as possible, she lived in a world that was detached from the reality around her much of the time. In her world the rules were different, and that of course created problems for her family and friends, who could not understand the seizures she sometimes experienced or her unsettling obsession with fire.The narrator is Lily's grown son, Charlie, who as a child tried to care for his mother during her bad spells, but who eventually went to live with his aunt and uncle when his mother's condition deteriorated to the point where she had to be institutionalized for the first time. When Lily's condition improved enough to be released she would find a place for her and Charlie to live and they would be a family again until her condition worsened and she had to be re-admitted.The story of Edith, Lily and Charlie is a close-up look at how mental illness can affect a family and even tear it apart when the stress of holding things together becomes overwhelming. It's a tragic illness that can strip the sufferer's life of everything meaningful and destroy relationships that can't bear the weight of it's confines and complexity. And yet, life goes on. As in real life, the characters in this book put one foot in front of the other and keep going because, what else is there to do? This is a well told, consuming story that may not let you put the book down when you want to. It's hard to resist.This is an amazing story, and I'm hoping to find more like it in Timothy Findley's other novels which include: Headhunter, Famous Last Words, Not Wanted on the Voyage, and The Wars. He has also written two collections of short stories and at least one play. \"The Piano Man's Daughter\" is well worth the read and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "My feelings are mixed on this book. It took me a little while to get into it, but that was not the author's fault. The writing is beautiful, the characters compelling. But for some reason, the initial time I picked it up to read was not the right time for me. I put it down, determined to get back to it shortly. It took me several months to pick up again, but once I did, there was no stopping me.There are a multitude of stories in this book. But ultimately it is about family and about love. Not just the love of burning passion, but the love that holds us to those we treasure despite their fractured souls, broken spirits and wounded bodies. And in that, there is beauty.FROM THE PUBLISHERIn 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, a young piano tuner, Charlie Kilworth, faces two enigmatic questions: Who was his father? And, given the madness that consumed his mother, does he dare become a father himself? Drawing on his own memories and the memories of those who knew and loved Lily Kilworth and on the iconic contents of a wicker suitcase she took with her everywhere, Charlie pieces together the story of a vivid, mercurial woman whose madness was both a gift and a curse. Conceived and born in a field of wildflowers and meadow grasses, Lily inhabits an idyllic late-Victorian world until the collision of two forces changes her life forever: she becomes entranced with fire and the terrifying freedom it unleashes in her mind; and, when her mother unexpectedly marries the brother of Lily's dead father, Lily moves with them from her grandparents' farm to the burgeoning metropolis of turn-of-the-century Toronto. As Charlie uncovers the bizarre and triumphant story of his mother, he begins to understand her need to escape, her fear of the voices beckoning from within the flames and her compulsion to heal the walking wounded. When he begins to forgive her for his own childhood, he arrives, finally, at the resolution of his quandaries about fatherhood."}, {"userName": "Trinda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859471-trinda", "userReview": "I think a multitude of factors affected why it took me so long to finish this one. I honestly didn't like this book. I don't know if it was the fact that it bounced around in time, and changed the narrator constantly, or if the fact that the storyline was a bit scattered, but it certainly isn't a book I want to read again. When I read the synopsis I thought it would have more about Charlie's daughter, than about his great-grandmother, grandmother and mother, but there really was limited information about his daughter.This book was about a man named Charlie who found out that his ex-wife had a little girl who is his. He was afraid that this little girl would have the same 'sickness' his mother had, and that she would continue to suffer throughout her life. Basically this book follows the life of his great-grandmother, grandmother and mother so that the reader can fully understand what his life and his mother's life was like with her sickness. Definitely not what I expected.I just want to clarify that, it's not that this book isn't well written, it's just not what I personally like in a story-line because of how it changes narrators without specifying. I also found it frustrating that the author didn't specify what kind of illness the mother had. I know part of it was epilepsy, but I'm almost wondering if she also had schizophrenia because of the visions she had.

I realize that I might have a bit of an obsession with his novels. What I found most intriguing about this book was his use of Toronto landmarks. As I live in Toronto this book felt very real to me in a way that might not have happened otherwise. As Findley always does, in this book he wonderfully portrays the underdog and the struggle to belong in a society that is far from the perfect we often like to perceive it to be. The part of this book that really stood out to me is when the young Lily runs away from home and while on the street car sees a man who begins to \"have a fit\". As she is epileptic she immediately sympathizes with this man but what she doesn't realize is that the man is not having a fit but masturbating while looking at her. But by seeing this man, who I would call a pervert, through Lily's eyes you see that he is ill, lost and someone who we should pity and want to help. It wasn't just that you could see Lily feeling this but I myself felt this kind of empathy for this man. BRILLIANT writing Findley!

It falls just short of Findley's better novels while sharing many of the same qualities that make him such a compelling author.This was an ambitious story of a life and a family that has been dealt an unfortunate genetic card. Mental illness has repeatedly afflicted the Kilworths as they navigate life turn-of-the-century Toronto. A life interrupted by war and seizures as conveyed by her only son. Timothy Findley conveys a strong sense of place throughout this meticulously researched story as he amasses a large cast of characters. Many of them felt under-developed out of necessity. But the characters he does allow the reader to know are an astonishing mix of human frailty, desire and perseverance. They can be funny, they can be tragic and they are often sympathetic. It's the tragedies, however, that loom largest.

Instead, it says a lot about my real life and how I tend to get sidetracked a great deal.The characters in this book are sad searchers, but what they are searching for never comes off as trite or monotonous. At first, I thought Charlie's desire to know his father was cliche and that I'd soon find myself bored to tears, but I must say having a male protagonist go on this journey was quite moving to me. This may be because I've got sons who are very close to their father or this may be due to how well Findley has developed his multi-faceted characters.I've read that others find the ending predictable and I can see how this would be true, but the words themselves on the final two pages are just so beautiful, that I can't just dismiss them.Read this book.
