There were so many elements to this book, attempted murder, scandal, war, adventure and my favorite... love. I did not realize this was book number 2 in the Miss Pickworth series. I hate reading series books out of order. I really wish they would number the books on the covers!! Although if this book was numbered, I probably would not have bought it because the store I bought it at was closing and they didn't have the first book available, I went back and checked. Usually the books that I give 5 stars to, are books that I go back through and reread all my favorite parts immediately after finishing the book. I can't get enough of them. They are usually on my mind for the rest of the day. I keep mulling over the happenings of the book. I even will pick out songs from my ipod that I think would go really well with the story. (I know, obsessive much?) AND I almost always long to see them made into a movie. This book is definitely one of those books. I have even made my daughter sit down and listen to some of my favorite parts. (She could care less, but she listens anyway.)I loved Anne's wit and her ability to square off and really hold her own with nobles. She had a lot of courage and gall. I also liked that she was good at sticking to her guns when it came to refusing Ruel. Because I wouldn't have been able to do it. She struggled sometimes but she good at taking a step back even when her feelings started to get stronger.I found Ruel Chouteau Marquess of Blackthorne, to be SO irresistible. I don't know how Anne could deny him for so long. Even with all his terrible qualities, and the way he used people to get what he wanted, I fell in love with him. I loved his spirit and his heart once he started listening to it that is. He was quite the seducer and each time he would sweet talk Anne, I would find myself swooning over him. I loved his smirking, and his playful banter in the way he teased \"Queen Anne\" at the beginning. I love how he almost instantly fell in love with Anne against his will, even though he didn't actually realize that was what had happened until well into the story. The one complaint I have about this book, is the ending was too abrupt. I wanted more. Especially after reading Deanne Gist books, she always has a very thorough ending, and I never feel like I am left wanting to know more. But this one I did feel that way at the end. ****This is kind of a spoiler alert.***** After all the seducing and all that smooth talking and even pleading at times, I was ready to read about Anne finally giving into him. I was really disappointed that it was not even addressed at the end. He kept saying over and over throughout the book, he would never take what was not offered to him, or he would never take what she was not ready to give. I thought the ending needed to have that final acceptance and trust in him that he so longed for. I know she did officially agree to give herself to him, but it never actually happened. And even after that there was still trust issues and she changed her mind about her decision the next morning. So it didn't really count to me. I wanted the full commitment. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~FAVORITE QUOTESOne of the many times he was trying to seduce Anne.\"You are disgraceful.\"\"Anne, look at me.\"\"I cannot. You repulse me.\"\"I entice you.\"\"You are repugnant.\"\"Tempting\"\"Lies!\" She grabbed the shirt fabric on his shoulders and squeezed it into fists. \"Lies!\"\"Truth.\" He leaned forward, taking her mouth again, pressing her against the window. \"Love me, Anne, I beg you. Love me.\""}, {"userName": "Mary Baker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2764513-mary-baker", "userReview": "This novel is a fast, safe read about the lace trade in 18th-19th century Europe. I thought the ending was predictable and contrived. I did like the main heroine although I thought she was a little forward for one who was a maid in an aristocrat's house. I enjoyed the romantic tension between the main female character and the main male character. It was a better than average Regency romance."}, {"userName": "Sabra Jones", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24057394-sabra-jones", "userReview": "ahhhhh!"}, {"userName": "Samuel Chineye", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76051490-samuel-chineye", "userReview": "I loved the book, quite interesting. it just goes a long way to say that it takes but a moment for someone's status to change."}, {"userName": "Alice", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7632663-alice", "userReview": "Review coming soon!"}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "Started badly with a spelling mistake/typo on page 5 (the 'tony Belgravia district'??), the marriage of convenience that was never properly legalised (marriage without banns or marriage license was deemed an 'irregular marriage', and was only legal in Scotland or Fleet Prison), and a Christian heroine marrying an unbeliever - this book runs the risk of being memorable for all the wrong reasons. The story was very formula Regency Romance - naive virgin meets wearied rake, they agree to a marriage of convenience for mutual benefit, followed by murder attempts and a growing attraction to each other (no mention of heaving bosoms or lustful looks, thankfully). There was a plot point added at the end regarding the hero's parentage that, in my view, was quite unnecessary.It attempted to be something more than stock Regency that it referred to the Luddite rebellion and Waterloo, but it never quite managed to achieve this. Although marketed as a Christian novel, the herooine was a lukewarm Christian at best (much was made of her reading her Bible every night, but no mention of going to church, and no convincing change of heart from the unbelieving hero, either - any rake worth the title can quote Song of Solomon for his own ends). Overall, The Bachelor's Bargain never quite managed to make the grade of secular writers (e.g. Georgette Heyer), or of more recent Christian Regency writers (e.g. Julie Klassen). It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good either."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766155-ashley", "userReview": "Now, I've never been a big Regency fan *ducks for cover* so, when I read the first book in the Miss.Pickworth series, The Affectionate Adversary, I was less then thrilled. But, I still wanted to read the other two books in the series , just to see how the story played out. And whoa baby, was I surprised at how much I LOVED reading The Bachelor's Bargain. We first meet Anne webster in The Affectionate Adversary, as the lowly handmaid, whose minister father, is imprisoned and needs her help. Where as Ruel Chouteau, has never cared much about anything except to regain the lost fortune of his family's Duchy (is that the how you say it?) . Some of my favorite parts of TBB, were where Anne and Ruel play act, in order to keep up their ruse of being happily married and blissfully ignorant. It was just too funny, and romantic. Anne was a heroin you couldn't help but love. She's always speaking her mind and not caring who hears and is strong in her faith (although, sometimes following God's plan, isn't apart of hers). Where as Ruel was the dashing rogue, who despite his rough exterior, had a heart of gold. *sigh* I loved that there wasn't just one romantic affair but two, involving the beautiful yet, self centered, Prudence Watson. Full of romance, faith and strong wills', The Bachelor's Bargain is probably the best Regency romance I've read to date."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "Okay, okay, I really shouldn't give this book five stars, because there were things I didn't care for, but I absolutely loved the characters and story so much that I can't help rate it for enjoyment alone. It's definitely my favorite in the series. It is a true romance, and that's where part of my objections come in.First, I thought there was undue attention on her wanting to have relations with her husband and yet not wanting to fully seal the wreckage of her future she knows is coming. There's discussion between them and some really heavy kissing, along with his brother outright asking her if her husband had bedded her yet. Definitely not something I'd recommend to a teen because of that.Second, the issue of his having been a notorious rake. Yes, he wasn't a believer, and yes, it was of course common in the day. It just made my instincts go awry to have such a fellow as the hero for the pure pastor's daughter.Third, that her pastor father had thought it was okay to get mixed up in the Luddite riots and the destroying of private property. I was really unimpressed that a minister wouldn't have tried to find some other way to assist his parishioners.But other than that I loved the story! Loved how the two found each other an influence to become stronger and better. And the ending was so perfect!"}, {"userName": "Sara \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155288-sara", "userReview": "This book was WAY better than the first book in the series!Anne Webster needs some way to help her family out... Her father was a minister, but he got thrown in jail due to his affiliation with some anti-industrializationists. Yeah, I'm sure that's a word. Anyway, so she's this AWESOME lace maker, and she's crafted a beautiful piece of lace and tries to sell it to Sir Alexander (Ruel Chouteau, Marquess of Blackthorne's younger brother)... Except wow, that doesn't go very well and Ruel comes in, back from America (and NOT dead, btw!)... Ruel's got this plan to save the duchy from financial ruin (his dad's the duke and he's next in line)\u007f\u2014through textiles, specifically LACE. Well how's that for convenient?Anyway, Ruel kind of jokingly proposes to Anne (to prove a point to his father), and then she gets shot and thinks she's gonna die, and in a last-ditch effort to save her family, she accepts his proposal. He does NOT think she's gonna die, and wants her lace-making skills, so he's like, \"Sweet!\" And they get married, and he's totally in love with her from the very beginning (without realizing it... sort of...), but she takes a while to come around... Then through some crazy circumstances, they end up at Waterloo... It was pretty intense! So so cute! 4.5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Elise Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1499288-elise-wilson", "userReview": "Well, this is my first time reading a Catherine Palmer book and I chose it because of the positive reviews written I had seen. However, I tend to be in agreement with the \"average\" rated reviewers. Personally, I just could not buy into the supposed developing love relationship between hero and heroine. Interestingly enough, I sort of liked both characters Ruel and Anne, and their individual stories, but just didn't see the chemistry between them. And at times I found Anne to be a bit self-centered, her primary aim being to save her family. I also thought the ending was a bit rushed and unbelievable in some ways. Having said that, I also think it's a worthwhile read. Palmer is a good writer and this story certainly has enough potential and suspense to make it an enjoyable light read. And I do plan to check out some of her other books."}, {"userName": "Kathy * Bookworm Nation", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1075341-kathy-bookworm-nation", "userReview": "This was a little unexpected, it turned out to be a little more historical fiction than regency romance, although it did have enough romance to keep me happy. I liked Anne & Ruel\u2019s characters a lot, they have good chemistry and I loved the passages between them, especially early on in their marriage. It was fun to watch their relationship grow and although they had their ups and downs, it only made them stronger. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but at times felt a little bogged down by history trivia. I would have liked a little more resolution with Anne\u2019s family, especially her father. Didn\u2019t really have a lot of closure there, it almost felt more like a plot piece and aside from them being mentioned now and then they were mostly forgotten. So, some things were a little predictable, but overall I thought the story was original and it was an entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Gloria", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9576361-gloria", "userReview": "[ Ruel is the older brother, and his mother believes that the title should go to her younger son, as does the younger son, Alexander.
