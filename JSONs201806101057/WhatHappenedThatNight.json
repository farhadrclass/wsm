One night Dahlia decides to attend a party with her friend and is brutally raped. Dahlia wakes up the next day and has no memory of the horrible assault. Years later, Dahlia is currently working as a paralegal and is suffering from PTSD from that horrible night. One day, Dahlia walks into her office and sees some of her male coworkers watching a video of a girl being brutally assaulted. Although, it's not just some girl... it's Dahlia herself on this video. All the horrible flashbacks and memories begin to surface for Dahlia. I feel like some of the scenes involving the brutal assault were hard to picture and hear about in the novel. But, the author was good about not going into too much detail involving the rape history. Dahlia meets James one of her coworkers along the way. He seems to be struggling with some issues of his own. James and Dahlia form a friendship and he tries to help Dahlia seek revenge on her attackers. I really liked James' character! He is such a sweetie :).The short chapters had me flying through this novel! I loved multiple POV and short chapters :).I felt like some of the parts were a little predictable which caused my rating to be a little lower. Additionally, I felt like it was missing something. I can't quite put my finger on it. Overall, it was an entertaining read :).3.75 starsThank you to Netgalley and Sourcebooks Landmark for the arc!

The next, she wakes up from a party, the victim of a brutal assault.When a young, happy, carefree girl goes to a party, she is brutally attacked. When she wakes up she can't remember who it was that attacked her. Five years later, she still struggles with panic attacks and nightmares. She dropped out of Havard and now works as a paralegal. Dahlia two friends, Daisy and Eli, have always supported her. Eli even goes to the support groups with her. She met and has formed a strong friendship with James who also attends the support group. Then, a video surfaces online, and Dahlia sees her attack for the first time. She now knows exactly what happened to her. I really liked the characters James and Dahlia, and the strong friendship they formed. The story is also told from their point of view. The chapters are short. The sexual assault part in this story is quite graphic and therefore might not be suitable or might upset some readers. This is a well written book but I did feel the ending was a bit rushed.

It is gripping and cleverly written, I love how the main protagonists worked out their issues, not following any one path but rather working through things as they went. The author manages to portray the realities of justice and the many layers of recovery really well and it was a bit of a page turner. One of the huge strengths of this was the growing relationship between Dahlia and James, I loved them both in different ways and What Happened That Night doesn't follow a usual path, it has a resoundingly satisfactory ending and whilst if I had one bug bear it was that a certain twist was very obvious early on and not really required to my mind, overall this is a book that I will happily recommend.I'll be reviewing it on Liz Loves Books nearer the time of publication."}, {"userName": "Chandra Claypool (wherethereadergrows)", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9722719-chandra-claypool-wherethereadergrows", "userReview": "I could not, in a million years, imagine what it's like to go through the trauma that Dahlia did, have PTSD of the event (that she cannot remember) and then see the attack come online years later. UFF. What I LOVE about this book is that the revenge factor is clear - but it's executed with the code of not killing anyone. The characters - how do you NOT fall in love with James?! Absolutely LOVE his character. The build up of friendship with Dahlia to something more was so much better than any instalove I've had to endure through. This felt so real and sincere between two people who have dealt with tragedy and can understand and accept the other's quirks. What's not to love?! Dahlia is also such a strong character. The ups and downs she goes through, the backlash after the attack of blaming the victim (her) from even her own family and how she deals with the consequences of her emotional roller coaster - really heart wrenching and I felt so MUCH for her throughout this read. My favorite secondary character? Has to be Natasha - I think if you read this book you'll totally understand why. Told from the point of view of Dahlia and James with a few chat room chats between the demons of the story, the short chapters keep your attention from page one to the very end. I felt my eyes drooping at one point but could NOT stop so fought my way through, stayed awake and finished the book. The author does a great job in putting you right inside the mind of and portraying Dahlia's heartache, James's Asberger Syndrome and even the pathetic and entitled minds of the Hawk Club. There are some graphic parts regarding the attack that may be hard for some readers. I think the author did it tastefully though and it was necessary to really get you inside Dahlia's head.If I had to be picky in any way about this, the ending did feel a teeny bit rushed after all the detail given throughout the rest of the book. I was so engaged in the characters that I didn't quite see the little twist! I knew there was one heading in that direction but my mind, weirdly, wasn't trying to figure it out and was enjoying the read outside of the twisty part. I am completely satisfied and could NOT put this book down. It gave me a little bit of \"The Accused\" movie with Jody Foster throughout. Oh sweet, sweet revenge - sometimes it is just SO satisfying!Thank you to the publisher for this copy <3"}, {"userName": "BAM The Bibliomaniac ", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac", "userReview": "Netgalley #55Many thanks go to Sandra Block, Sourcebooks, and Netgalley for the free copy of this book in exchange for my unbiased review.You know at first this book was only so-so, but now I can\u2019t put it down!

Dahlia, from her \u201csurvivor\u201d tattoo to her endless supply of moxie, is a protagonist that readers will cheer for. Like a phoenix, she rises from the ashes of despair, and takes charge.

My heart ached for Dahlia for 5 years ago she was drugged and gang raped by 5 boys. She went from being a pretty girl that night to a changed girl that night. She had no clue who did this to her. She got seizures, tried to kill herself, turned to alcohol. All because of what these sick monsters did to her. Fast forward to present day when she is working and sees the video of her being raped!! Yes, there was a video that she never knew about! Now Dalia wanted to find out exactly who these men were and wanted revenge.James was one of the characters I liked the most in the book.

And it turns out my coverlove instinct was absolutely right. Dark, gritty, painful and strong...\u00a0What Happened That Night\u00a0is without doubt a story that will crawl under your skin, unsettle you and leave you with an uncomfortable but satisfied feeling after you finish it. Why? Let's just say that there are a lot of trigger warnings in place for the more sensitive readers, including for rape, violence, suicide and graphic scenes in general. If you can stomach those elements, you will find yourself a very interesting thriller in\u00a0What Happened That Night. The writing style is engaging and I liked the diversity of the main characters and their development. Dahlia is a very strong character with a lot of problems, but I like her style. James is also a favorite, and I appreciate that his Asperger's syndrome plays a role throughout the story. The dynamics between Dahlia and James are interesting as well and is part of the reason this book works. That said, I did have my doubts about the credibility of it all, especially involving the revenge plan\u00a0 Dahlia and James have developed. I seriously doubt they would be able to get away with all that... And I saw credibility holes in the plot as well. More importantly, I was also able to guess one or two mayor plot twists early on even though I kept hoping I was wrong. That might just be me reading a lot of thrillers in the first place though. Because there is no doubt\u00a0What Happened That Night\u00a0is a superfast, dark and twisted thriller that will chill you to the bone.Dahlia used to be a successful Harvard student on her way to becoming a lawyer, but that all changed one horrible night. She wakes up after a party after having been brutally assaulted. The worst part: she doesn't seem to remember anything from that night, just that her life will never be the same. Years later, she still suffers from PTSD and hasn't properly been able to deal with that night... Until one day, a video turns up online and Dahlia sees for the first night what really happened during the attack. And now she knows who to blame, she is out for her revenge...What Happened That Night\u00a0isn't any easy read and trigger warnings are in place, but if you like your thrillers dark and gritty you will be in for a treat. This story has an original ring to it, both because of the selection of characters and the plot itself. True, I had my doubts about the credibility and I was able to guess one or two key plot twists, but that doesn't take away this is still a pretty darn good and twisted thriller.

Top grade student she was well on her way to her law degree until that night, at that party, five years ago, something horrible happened to her. She knows she was assaulted but her memory is gone. Fast forward to the present day and we reconnect with her as she is now, still suffering badly from that night, and with her education cut short after what happened, she is now working as a paralegal. One day, a video appears on the web which she sees colleagues watching. She has a look and recognises herself. It's a video of her attack, Not only that, it identifies her attackers. She now has the evidence of what happened to her. But, with her memory of the way the Police handled her after she initially reported the attack, how they treated her, how they blamed her, she isn't about to take it to them to investigate. No way. With her hackles up and her rage unleashed, she remembers the old adage; revenge is a dish best served cold.Its hard to say that I enjoyed this book due to the nature of what happened to Dahlia. Indeed, it was at times a hard book to read. But the author does a great job of giving enough to set the scene but not too much that it is overpowering. It was harrowing and horrible, especially when we \"met\" the guys involved in the events that took place and the way they \"talked\" about them. But this was offset very well by the friendship that blossomed between Dahlia and James, a colleague who offers to help her with some of the investigative side of things. James's own story in itself adds to the colour of the whole book. It's hard to say much more about the specifics about what happens in the book without giving anything away but suffice to say that the main theme running through the narrative was about a young woman taking back her life. Whether she achieves this and whether it helps her, well, you'll just have to read it for yourself.Not having gone through anything nearly like what happened to Dahlia, it was hard for me to really connect with her apart from obviously feeling deeply for what she went through. I couldn't quite connect with her fully and thought that some of the things she did were a little bit off. But then, not having walked in her shoes, who am I to judge. I just can't help thinking that maybe there was a different way to go. That speaks more about me than the author but I have to be honest in my review. I actually better connected to James and what he was going through. And I really did feel for him, maybe more than Dahlia. All in all, a tough but on the whole satisfying read which I definitely think could be a great book club read as it definitely made me think and question my morals and ethics.My thanks go to the Publisher and Netgalley for the chance to read this book."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3156542-jen", "userReview": "A psychological thriller that will leave the reader turning the pages long into the night, What Happened That Night is the story of Dahlia.

The way Dahlia and James went about achieving her revenge seemed hard to believe and their relationship was difficult for me to understand. It was an unsettling book and I am still sitting on the fence as to how I feel about it right now.Did I like it? Not sureWas it well written? First person point of view of James and Dahlia with flashbacks \u2013 Style fine \u2013Was it believable? Not to meWould I read another book by this author?
