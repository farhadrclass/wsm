I loved, loved,loved it.Here's the basic premise: What was Eve's life like after Eden?The story goes back and forth in time and is told in 4 voices: Eve's and her daughters, Naava, Dara and Aya. Oddly, Naava's is always told in the 3rd person, while the others are in 1st person. Eve is portrayed very realistically and not always sympathetically. Like a real person, she has strengths and weaknesses. Naava is mostly portrayed negatively while Dara is mostly positive and Aya is a mix. Interestingly, it is Aya who has the strongest faith, while Eve, who ostensibly met Elohim (God), is challenged to retain her faith.If you like historical fiction, this would be a good choice. Elliott researched Mesopotamian life and included their food, their religious practices and like that. The writing is descriptive without being overly so, the dialog is realistic despite the simplicity of the speech patterns. I read very quickly but I made myself slow down and savor the book, reading it slowly to be sure I didn't miss anything. If you liked The Red Tent, you'll likely enjoy this story as well. If you wonder about Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, you'll likely enjoy \"Eve.\" If you're a Christian who interprets the Bible literally, chances are good there will be things that you won't like and that might even make you mad. Be forewarned. If you're a New Though Christian, you'll recognize yourself in Aya. If you're not a Christian at all but just like good historical fiction, you'll still enjoy this story."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2291692-heather", "userReview": "Eve: A Novel of the First Woman by Elissa ElliottGenre: Biblical FictionMany people know the story the Bible tells of Adam and Eve: Adam was the first man, Eve was created from his rib, they were expelled from Eden for eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they had 2 sons (Cain & Abel) and Cain killed Abel. That is about where the Bible\u2019s version of this story ends. Elissa Elliott picks up where the story leaves off and creates a very detailed back story for these first people. She uses the story from the Bible as the backbone for her story about Eve.This book is told from the viewpoints of Eve and her three daughters, Naava, Aya, and Dara (something never mentioned in the Bible). Each of their perspectives gives a unique look at the world around them. Naava is the eldest daughter who does everything to improve her own place in the world, sometimes creating problems for her family at the same time. Aya is the second oldest daughter and she has a deformity to her foot. Despite this condition she is a necessity to the family as she is the cook and the healer. Dara is the youngest, part of a set of twins, and she is used by the family as a go-between for the family and the newcomers. Eve is questioning if God exists because he hasn\u2019t come to them since they were expelled from Eden. These females tell the stories of the men in their lives as well. Cain, the eldest, has a temper and is questioning the presence of God. Abel, the second oldest, does anything to help his family and believes that he can hear the voice of God, which really upsets his older brother. Jacan, Dara\u2019s twin, follows Abel\u2019s lead and is learning the ways of tending to the herds and listening to God. Finally there is Adam. He is the strong, quiet presence \u2013 always believing in the presence of God.This book takes place at three different periods of time. Most of the story takes place in the months leading up to the death of Abel at the hands of Cain. During this time they meet the newcomers to the area and their presence and influence severely disrupts the pattern of the family. Through Eve\u2019s retellings we learn of their life within the Garden of Eden, what led up to their expulsion from that Garden, and their travels to the place where they eventually settle down. The third period of time is very late in life right before Eve\u2019s death. Naava has come back to see Eve before she dies.I was very interested in reading this book because the early Bible stories are very interesting and create a great backbone for a novel. Elliott does an amazing job of weaving what is written in the Bible with her own story of the family. Her characters are very real and all of them have a distinct personality. As the story was coming to an end I realized that I didn\u2019t want it to end. I wanted to know more about this family and what would happen after Abel\u2019s death. I found that during reading this book I would look things up in the Bible to get an idea of what the back story was. I learned a lot during this process. I now can\u2019t wait to read other books from this genre and can\u2019t wait to see what this author comes out with next.5 out of 5 stars!!!"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5317203-nicole", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this entire book. The flashbacks to life in the Garden, the temptation of the forbidden fruit, and their consequent expulsion were really interesting and well written. Unfortunately, that was only about 15% of the book. The rest of the story fell into repetitive and self-absorbed reflections. The story is written from the viewpoint of the women in Eve's family, but they each fall into a female stereotype that was really cringeworthy. It was as though Eve produced all the facets of Woman: Naava, the beautiful, selfish seductress; Aya, the knowledgeable earth mother; Dara, the compassionate. Eve herself tried desperately to hold her family together and bind them to God while continually questioning why God let them fall so far from grace. Because the female characters couldn't get much further than their own grievances, the male characters (with the exception of Cain, who plays a large role in the plotline) are static characters that also fall into stereotypical roles. Adam and Abel, in particular, had no motivation for their actions. Abel was good because he was born good, Adam was distant and unavailable because... there was no room for him to have a personality with all the whining Eve was doing? The family is also put into a strange plotline that technically revolves around the events leading up to Cain killing Abel, but it is swept away by the family's involvement with people from a nearby city and by the time we catch up with it again, Abel's death seems like an anti-climactic end to the story.If one is looking for good biblical fiction, I suggest Anita Diamant's \"The Red Tent\" or books by Francine Rivers. Skip this one-- interesting premise, but unlikeable and undeveloped characters in an odd plotline."}, {"userName": "Terence", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence", "userReview": "In Eve: A Novel of the First Woman I was hoping to read a provocative account of the Abrahamic religions' mythical genetrix. Unfortunately, it's a fairly predictable, by-the-numbers, Christian apologia. I will give Elliott points for making Eve's and Adam's succumbing to Lucifer's temptations plausible but all the major characters - Adam, Eve, Abel, Cain, and the daughters Naava, Aya and Dara - are too broadly drawn and are \"types\" rather than real people. Elliott also can't seem to decide whether the Creation myths are real or not. Adam and Eve awaken in the Garden and do meet Elohim (Elliott's name for God), who claims to have created them, but 20 years or so after the banishment, the struggling family encounters a whole passel of Sumerians building the city of Inanna. People who have been around for generations and already have a highly advanced civilization. The theology is reminiscent of Job: Man is created to glorify God and it's presumption to question his word. As a nonbeliever, the reliance on Christian (and Jewish or Muslim, for that matter) dogma didn't detract from the believability of the novel. What bothered me was the matter above - either accept the Creation as largely true and go from there or resolve how the story was created within the context of the emergence of urban civilizations.Elliott's not a bad writer, though obviously not an experienced one. I hope her talent grows with any subsequent novels, but I doubt I'll want to read anything else from her pen."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929158-michelle", "userReview": "From the AP:\u00b6 \"Eve: A Novel of the First Woman\" (Delacorte Press, 421 pages, $24), by Elissa Elliott: Tossed from the Garden of Eden for a seemingly insignificant act _ eating a piece of fruit _ Eve is adrift.\u00b6 What did it mean? Why was the punishment so harsh? And then, where is God? Does he still exist? Does he remember her?\u00b6 Drawing on scholarly studies of Genesis, Judaism and Mesopotamia, and written in the easy-to-read style of \"The Red Tent\" and \"Queenmaker,\" Elissa Elliott's first novel offers a fresh and insightful vision of the life of the first women.\u00b6 For starters, Elliott questions whether Eve was in fact first. Two decades after their expulsion from the Garden, Adam and Eve encounter technologically advanced Mesopotamians.\u00b6 This raises plenty of questions: Did God create these people as well? Did another god create them?\u00b6 It also causes trouble as Eve's eldest children become enamored with the urban culture and its many gods. They pray to idols. They want to make sacrifices.\u00b6 The outcome, of course, is no surprise: God favors second son Abel's sacrifice because it is made with a pure heart. Enraged, his brother Cain murders Abel.\u00b6 The twists and surprises _ which won't all be given away here _ come in Elliott's imagining of the family dynamics that create an angry fuse for God's lightning to strike.\u00b6 Cain is jealous of Abel, who escapes to the hills with his sheep and younger brother, Jacan. Eldest daughter Naava is vain. Second daughter Aya is self-righteous. Eve trades her third daughter, Dara, to the Mesopotamians. All seek Adam's attention and approval, but he is a distant father, too busy keeping the family sheltered and fed to worry much about their spirits. And Eve wallows in the past, mourning the tragedy of the Garden while failing to see the one building before her.\u00b6 Like many of the best novels, \"Eve\" works on two levels. Elliott's plot is action-packed, but her story also raises spiritual questions about free will, creation and the human relationship with God.\u00b6 Adam and Eve re-enact their relationship with God with their children, allowing them to make their own decisions, grieving the consequences and casting them out.\u00b6 In doing so, Eve finds the answer she has been seeking: It was not that God stopped loving her but that she stopped recognizing his love."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1032563-kim", "userReview": "I thought about giving this book five stars, but I feel like that should maybe be reserved for all-time favorites. So let's just call this 4 1/2 stars. I absolutely loved this book. I felt really attached to the characters and the story from the very beginning, and couldn't wait to get back to the book every time I had to put it down. I loved the concept of the book -- a fictional telling of Eve's life after the expulsion from Eden. The chapters rotate between the voices of Eve and her three daughters -- Naava, Aya and Dara. Aya quickly became my favorite character. I enjoyed reading about the different relationships each of the characters had with God (or gods). The descriptions of Eden and Elohim (god) are lovely and breathtaking, I thought, and the Fall is so heartbreaking. There were also some really interesting insights into male/female roles and how maybe god never really wanted it to be that way. I also really liked many of Eve's insights into motherhood, the joys and the struggles. The reviews of this book on Goodreads are pretty mixed, but I really think most of you all (family & friends) would really like it."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1368750-sally", "userReview": "To be fair, I quit reading about halfway through. I couldn't handle the writing or the whining anymore.Authors, if you're going to have each chapter be from a different character, then learn to write in distinguishable voices, please. As it was in this book, Eve and her daughters all sounded the same.Which was pretty much whiny.The other reason I could not finish was because of the \"poetic license\" the author took with this \"historical\" novel. The author said in the back that she stuck to the Genesis story, but the Genesis I remember (and am currently reading, oddly enough) has Adam and Eve as the only humans created by God and all life stems from them. Not with an added mysterious group of neighbors who just turn up (way before Adam and Eve's children had offspring), speaking in different languages and bringing false idols as gifts. HUH? Diiiiid I miss a few (hundred) chapters in the book of Genesis that the author supposedly stuck to?Of course, the author also states that she added the other people for diversity to the story.Again...HUH?Sounds like a writer who wasn't creative enough to form a story from real history, so she needed to add a little something.In my opinion, the story of the first family, first sin and first murder would be plenty to write about on its own.It was bad on so many levels."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5702610-sarah", "userReview": "(I would hide this because of spoilers, but I'm kind of figuring everyone knows the story of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, so... my bad.)Evocative, intimate, lusciously written, and - because we all know the story - at times almost painful to read, this novel comes highly recommended. I love the way Elissa Elliott portrays these characters. The voices of the women are each exquisitely rendered (Dara's narration, as the youngest, is particularly heart-wrenching in some places, especially after the death of her beloved brother Abel) and the men in the family - although not serving as narrators - are also incredibly well written, with even the infamous Cain drawing sympathy, despite his ill fate.I adored the portrayal of Adam and Eve's relationship, as well as the palpable tension between Cain and Abel, and the writing in general was absolutely gorgeous. There are some descriptions that I actually had to pause and think about, they were so darn pretty.Basically, I really enjoyed this book, for everything from the engrossing plot and distinctive characters to the intriguing questions brought up about God, free will, relationships, and religion.

While the author did a great job bringing the characters to life and telling the stories of Eve and each of her daughters, it also gets incredibly frustrating after awhile; the voices begin to blur together and, towards the end, I was fed up with all of the women due to their constant whining and a selfishness that seemed uniform for each. They became very stereotyped and, in many ways, it came off as pretty misogynistic: Naava was an empty-headed girl obsessed with men, Eve was the clingy nagging wife too self-absorbed to realize that she's pushed her husband away, Aya was the mother martyr, and Dara just seems largely unimportant.Still, the writing was descriptive and vivid, bringing the Garden to life and the hardships that followed.

This is Elissa Elliott's first novel but she provides a well written protrayal of Adam and Eve. Told mostly from Eve's prosepective the author weaves a tale of Eve's life. Her banishment from the Garden of Eden and how it greatly affected her throughout the rest of her days. She struggled with her belief, her marriage and her children. For the most part I found it believable and fascinating. The anger and guilt Eve felt towards God are feelings many of us struggle with today. Touching and inspiring to read how Eve and members of her family floundered with prayer and worship. How they dealt with the hardships of life.

I could understand Eve's feelings of abandonment by Elohim. That loss of companionship and intimacy with Him was confusing for her and shook her faith. In my opinion, a believable scenario.

It was a fast read and I should have slowed down to really absorb everything. Overall, this was a good book. I was worried about it becuase I haven't read the Bible yet, or because I didn't know much about Adam and Eve and their family. I liked all the characters, especially Aya who was disabled. I was super suprised that Eve kept questioning the existance of God throughout the book too! And how she would go back and forth from being submissive to being strong to submissive again.

The novel begins with the death of Abel by his brother Cain (and no I 19m not spoiling anything here, folks 13 it 19s in the Bible!) and eventually ends there as well, but the novel comes full-circle by way of assorted flashbacks. While Elliott does devote a small part of her book to Adam and Eve 19s life in the garden, the majority of the novel is post-expulsion, centering around the life they made for themselves in the desert. Elliott takes the liberty of giving Adam and Eve six children, and the book 19s narration is shared by Eve and her three daughters. Sometimes this type of narration gets on my nerves, but similar to The Help, I found it interesting and even appropriate in this instance.While this isn 19t the most amazing or even most engrossing book I 19ve read, what impressed me so much about it was the fact that Elliott was taking on a beast by choosing this story as her first novel, and she handled it amazingly well and with an enormous amount of creativity. First, she brings Eve to life in a truly beautiful way. I feel like you will particularly get a sense of this if you are a woman reading this novel. Due to the curse, Eve now has to deal with problems like the devastation of miscarriages, favoritism with her children, and enmity toward her husband. These problems bring forth all sorts of emotions which Elliott makes quite real and raw throughout the novel. She also takes the liberty of assuming that there were other people on the earth at this time, which provides a catalyst for much of the novel 19s conflict and action.What I found the most poignant about this novel, though, was the relationship between God, or Elohim as he is called in the book, and the other characters. Where is Elohim in this novel? For the most part, he is not there 26or is he? This is a question each character in the novel must grapple with in his/her own way at some point. I was really affected by the way some of the characters, Eve and her daughter Aya in particular, struggled with Elohim 19s absence. I found comfort in this perhaps truly age-old struggle. While Aya is the family 19s rock, never losing faith in Elohim, but secretly wishing to see or hear him, Eve finds herself at the opposite end of the spectrum most of the time, angry that Elohim would take away the closeness they once had and seemingly ignore her and her family. For me, it 19s difficult to not be moved by her anger and sadness, because these are emotions I, too, have experienced at points in my life (haven 19t we all?). I don 19t want to give away the ending, but let 19s just say it ends with an equally moving conclusion on Eve 19s part suggesting that the problem is not Elohim at all. Eve 19s just as human as you or me!I 19d definitely recommend this book to anyone open-minded enough to check out a fictional account of the biblical story with many liberties taken. I 19m trying to stress this because if you don 19t understand this, then you may be highly disappointed, irritated, or even offended at what Elliott has done. I think it 19s fabulous myself, but I consider myself fairly liberal."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2582387-marvin", "userReview": "I thought it would be interesting to read this immediately after Gioconda Belli's novel of Adam & Eve, especially since its narrative basically picks up where Belli's leaves off, though it intermittently fills in the back story. Alas, this one suffers by the comparison. Narrated by Eve & three of of her daughters (though one's sections are in third person for some reason), it's largely a domestic drama of a dysfunctional family. Early on Eve characterizes each of her 6 children\u20143 boys & three girls\u2014with one word (ingenious, sweet, feisty, resourceful, tender, compassionate), and they all remain one-dimensional\u2014all except Aya, who refuses to recognize her limits & creates other names for herself (Aya the Brave, Aya the Stouthearted, Aya the Snake Killer, Aya the Bird). She, the deformed one patronized by the rest of the family for her deformity, keeps the family together with her cooking skills & healing powers; and she also, in the brief passages she gets to narrate intermittently, almost single-handedly makes it worth continuing with this novel, which is so limited otherwise in its range and plausibility. 15 years after they're expelled from the Garden of Eden, they\u2019re living in a brick house with a courtyard & garden, raising crops with all kinds of implements, herding sheep & goats, eating with bowls by the light of oil lamps, with all kinds of technological & cultural developments that the author does not even attempt to make plausible. There\u2019s a nearby city that they\u2019ve had no contact with that speaks a different language and yet the prince is somehow able to communicate haltingly with them in their language. This city provides the means for the second generation to repeat the sin of the first, as Cain and the beautiful daughter Naava are seduced by the sophistication of the city\u2019s beauty, technology, culture, and religion and come to arrogantly prefer them to the simplicity of their family\u2019s already traditional ways. This is all told in a breathless, at times preachy & didactic, prose that is grating. (See esp. page 32, where Eve recalls first coming to consciousness next to Adam. \"Adam shone. . . . His skin and his face glowed as though the light of the sun itself were a garment. He was a garden spring, a refreshing well of water. He was a tree, strong and able, with a bunched force across his arms and chest. The hair on his head and chin and chest was dark and clumped, like clusters of dates, his nose long and sloped. His lips were apricots, sweet and honeyed. I confess, I liked them with my tongue, gently, as you would a dripping peach. . . . Adam opened his eyes, black as obsidian, and gazed into mine for the first time. He smiled and, with his finger, traced my lips and nose and eyebrows. My thighs grew warm; my belly clenched. 'So,' he said. 'You've come.'\" Read Belli's account instead; she creates a more plausible world with considerably more intellectual depth as well."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8614490-carrie", "userReview": "It's difficult for me to review this one. There were things I liked and things I didn't. To summarize, the author takes the Biblical story of Adam and Eve and then uses her imagination (with help from other books and historical information) to fill in the \"how\" of what happened - how Eve was tempted, how she and Adam were expelled from The Garden, how Cain came to be full of rage and kill Abel, etc. The story is mostly told from the points of view of Eve and her daughters. To my knowledge, the Bible doesn't mention Eve's daughters, but it does say that she and Adam had several other children, so this would be an example of the author using her imagination to fill in the story. When I first started reading, I was caught off guard by the language used - some of the words didn't feel right or seem appropriate for the time-period, however I'm certainly no etymologist, and after reading the author's Afterward and her explanation of why she made some of the word choices she did, I felt a tad more forgiving.Also I would describe many of the thoughts and conclusions of the characters as being \"American\" in nature or possibly too mature for the time period - so although I enjoyed that I could empathize with certain emotions or thoughts, it felt...a little off. Does that make sense? According to the Bible, during Eve's time on Earth, people lived much longer than they do now, so maybe this is where the author felt she could take some liberties with the maturity of thoughts? So. What did I like? I really enjoyed the description of The Garden and life with Elohim (God) there, and the detailed unfolding of events that showed how evil could seep into the lives of the family over time, even with their good intentions. I found it intriguing to see how each person's choices and longings and faith affected the other family members. The Biblical account has always left me with so many questions, and to be truthful, I've not always felt so fond or forgiving of Eve. It's not that I think this fictional book can answer my questions, but after reading this and rereading the beginning of Genesis a few times, I felt more aware of how Adam, Eve, and especially Cain could've gotten to the point that they did. There were some slow spots where Eve droned on a bit, but there were also several gripping scenes, especially ones involving her children, where I couldn't put it down. This book won't be for everyone. If you read it, definitely read the Afterward."}, {"userName": "Alexa Ayana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2858235-alexa-ayana", "userReview": "Alkitab menceritakan banyak sekali perempuan hebat dan teladannya. Tapi apakah kita tidak ingin untuk belajar juga dari kesalahan perempuan yang perbuatannya gagal menyenangkan hati Tuhan? Kalau kita berbicara tentang kegagalan dan dosa, siapa yang bisa mengalahkan popularitas Hawa. Selama ini dia sering dituding sebagai biang kejatuhan pria, lambang ketidakpatuhan dan penyebab manusia harus hidup menderita di luar Taman Firdaus. Seperti cuplikan kata-katanya ini : \" bagi sebagian orang namaku kecut di lidah dan sumbang ditelinga. Namun pahami ini: kenangan adalah suci, tudingan adalah sebaliknya.\"Menurutku Elissa Elliott hebat dalam memadukan isi Kitab Kejadian sebagai kerangka, bumbu karakter tambahan fiksi dengan catatan sejarah untuk menempatkan twist baru yang kuat pada kisah keluarga pertama penciptaan ini. Apalagi jika diingat ini adalah novel pertama yang ditulisnya. Buki ini akan membawa kita pada kehidupan Hawa sebagai istri, ibu, dan seorang wanita. Dengan gaya bahasa puitis yang indah dan ekspresif dia membuat roman ini menjadi menakjubkan. Elliott berani me-reka ulang perjalanan Hawa sebelum dan sesudah pengusiran dari Firdaus, pernikahannya kompleks, hubungan dengan para putrinya, dan tragedi yang menimpa putra-putranya.Elliot menghidupkan banyak karakter yang digali mendalam. Kita jadi bisa mengenal Kain, betapa jenius dan cerdasnya dia, betapa posesif dan pencemburunya dia, betapa rindunya dia akan secuil kasih sayang ibunya, dan kepahitan-kepahitannya. Abel yang lembut dan tak tergoyahkan. Adam yang gila kerja tapi sangat romantis. Aku tersentuh saat melihatnya mengubur sambil menangis tapi berusaha menghibur Hawa saat bayi pertama mereka mati saat lahir prematur. Bagaimana dia membuatkan miniatur taman Firdaus untuk Hawa, menyanyi untuk Hawa saat istrinya kesakitan di kehamilannya yang sudah memasuki usia tua.Aku tidak bisa menyebutnya sebagai pelengkap Kitab Kejadian. Tapi setidaknya bisa membantu memahami beberapa lubang keingintahuan kita sekaligus membuka lubang yang baru. Seperti misalnya kalau mereka adalah manusia pertama yang diciptakan, siapakah bangsa asing yang menyembah berhala dan berinteraksi bersama mereka. Ini adalah kisah tentang kesalahan yang bisa berujung pada kesalahan lain. Diceritakan oleh wanita, untuk wanita lainnya. Untuk dipelajari dan diambil hikmahnya.Quote Favorite :\"Mata dan Telinga Tuhan Allah tidak tertutup.

I was really curious about what happened with Adam and Eve, and I think this book answered that question. I loved everything about the book, it follows the bible all too well and I like how the author composed the situation from Eve's point of view, along with her daughters, who I was also curious about and wondered about which one the bible was talking about, since we never heard their names in the bible.For Eve, I could feel her anguish and sorrow when she and Adam were banished from God's sight in the Garden of Eden. I knew that it must have been very painful to her that the one thing that brought her closer to god was taken away all thanks to eating the forbidden fruit, plus she was so easily subdued by Satan's bad boy charm. Too bad he got the bad part of the good lords curse.For Naava, I knew that she was not a good girl from the very start of the book, makes me wonder what Cain saw in her, (Not that I am blaming one of those ancestors who gave all of us life, I have nothing against their actions) and to make things worse, she and Cain easily turned away from god for those nonexistent ones that the city people had. If I was her, I would have turned away from that and keep worshipping the rightful lord who made us all.For, Aya, she, along with Abel, are my favorite characters above the others. She kept her faith with God strong even when her family were going through the toughest of times and almost gave up on God. I admire her for that. I somehow believe that after reading the book, was she the one who had Noah? For I remember that at Noah's time, the rest of the world was tainted by evil and Noah and his family didn't fall under that spell as easily like how the others did. It would be awesome if she had Noah as her descendant!For Dara, I was surprised to know that she fell under the same spell as Cain had when finding out that there were more gods and goddesses, to which I pity her for thinking about believing in them and then still clings to the main god who created her mother and father, I am sad to say that she was my second least favorite in the book, with Naava being the first.I get that the cultures and different variations of the story are good. I would definitely recommend this to any believer in the bible."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie", "userReview": "Belief is not always easy. Even when you have seen and heard the thing you are supposed to believe in.\nEve is just mentioned in a few chapters of the Bible, but that has not stopped her from being one of the most vilified women in the Christian religion, right up there with Jezebel, Delilah, and Salome. But what was it like to be the first woman, the first wife, and the first mother? What would it have been like for Eve to have to deal with the fact that one of her sons killed the other in a jealous rage? How did she handle the guilt of being the reason for expulsion from the Garden? In this ambitious novel, Elissa Elliott tried to bring Eve to life through the experience of one terrible summer and the eyes of Eve's three daughters.I always find something fascinating in the re-imagining of the lives of Biblical women. Because of the misogynistic focus of most Bible stories, they are mentioned in passing and then never heard from again. What were their lives really like? We will never know, but novelists, such as Elliott, help us get a little closer. This book shows what it might have been like for Eve, a woman with no mother or sisters to lean on who had to figure out the role of a wife and mother for herself. The whole family gets to play a part in telling the story as alternate chapters are written from Eve's and her three daughters' perspectives. Elliott also tries to give the story a historical context, setting it in the budding civilizations of Mesopotamia (yes there are other people on the Earth beyond Adam and Eve which may be troublesome for some readers). The story mainly focuses on the summer of Cain's murder of Abel, but includes flashbacks on Adam and Eve's time in the garden and earlier memories of their growing family. It works pretty well but there are some unbelievable elements and I could have done with more flashbacks.If you are the type of person who takes every word of the Bible literally, you are not going to enjoy this story, but if you are more interested in the emotional lives of Biblical characters (women especially) then I suggest reading this book. It is not the best Biblical novelization I have come across, but its a pretty good story nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Kiri", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3910665-kiri", "userReview": "I thought this book was going to be a lot better than it was. I feel as if it was one of those stories that has so much potential (much like stories told from Guinevere's point of view in the Arthur legend - if anyone has a really good book from her point of view, let me know! I've read too many that are not satisfying), but falls short. It has a great premise - a story told from the point of view of Eve, supposedly the first woman to ever exist. There is a lot of weight that goes with this woman, especially the fact that she was blamed for the downfall of humankind for centuries during the Middle Ages by the Roman Catholic Church...she has quite a nasty reputation. Eve is blamed for women's sins, their shortcomings, and seductive nature. I feel that Elissa Elliott touched briefly on the Eve vs. Adam, woman vs. man entanglements presented by the Bible, but she could have gone much further. Much of the story was focused on Eve dwelling in her self-pity and self-hatred, whereas she could have made her a much stronger character. She almost played into the belief that woman have no self-control when she recounts the whole story of Lucifer convincing Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. That whole storyline could have been delved into and really fleshed out with more questioning from Eve and more hesitation. Instead, Elliott focused a lot on the family of Eve and Adam, with the plot revolving around Cain and Abel, and eventually the murder at the end of the novel. This was interesting, and written very similarly to the Poisonwood Bible, told from each of the daughter's points of views. Much of the book was a little slow with a lot of internal musings, but it picked up at the end and the climax was quite interesting. I liked how she brought in the different people from a nearby city...throwing into question if Adam and Eve were really the first people in existence. As a story, this was a good book. However, there could have been a lot more brought into this novel and I was disappointed when the book was focused more on Cain and Abel and how weak of a character Eve was."}], "description": "BONUS: This edition contains an Eve\u00a0discussion guide.In this mesmerizing debut novel, Elissa Elliott blends biblical tradition with recorded history to put a powerful new twist on the story of creation\u2019s first family.
