It's all a bit predictable. Once Libby finds out she has cancer and that her husband is not who she thinks he is all in the same day, she pulls a disappearing act and runs off to an island to hide. There's a dark sexy man, there's a kind older woman, there's a sensitive twin brother, there's lots of denial, etc... It's a tad difficult to have sympathy for Libby because she's so darn stubborn about doing anything about her situation. So why did I keep reading? I was in the right mood to read a predictable light book about what should have been a serious subject? But somehow it was readable and I liked it well enough to give it 3 stars. But I'm not sure I would have felt the same about this book last week or next week.

But wow, this book was a gem. The main character, Libby, is wonderful, and the author did a really great job of illustrating how a real person would react to the stream of curve balls being thrown. I loved the transformation Libby went through and the adventure we got to watch her experience. The other characters were great, too - they were diverse, unique, and lovely additions to the story. The setting was great and the pacing was perfect. I flew through this book because even though it's a lighter read with subtle plot points, it's incredibly addicting. As you can see, I finished it in under a day! The ending was satisfying, too. The author didn't leave any lose ends and the readers receive all the needed closure after bonding with Libby for 200 pages. My only complaint is that the plot is not the most original idea. Don't get me wrong, though, I absolutely adore the story Camille Pag\u00e1n created and I would happily read more of her work. I highly recommend this book. If you have Amazon Prime - take advantage of Kindle First and choose this book (October 2015)!"}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30962427-liz", "userReview": "I disliked this book with a passion at odds with its fundamental silliness. The plot seems weighty: young woman diagnosed with rare, almost certainly fatal cancer on the same day her beloved husband tells her he's gay. Cue extreme crisis and self-examination. Instead, it's a flippant, frothy book filled with fake curse words-- e.g. \"motherfudger\"-- and childish repetition, in which virtually every character's voice/diction are the same underneath superficial, ludicrous differences. Though I wouldn't call the author talentless, I would certainly say that she was out of her league with these themes.Some spoilers follow, if you care (which you shouldn't).Issue 1: Our protagonist, Libby, is a horrible person that the story requires you to believe is sweet and sunshiney without showing you any evidence to that effect.I'm really not sure why Pagan chose to frame this story as the tale of a woman with \"rose-colored glasses\" who finally gets a dose of reality. In every scene, to every person, Libby is snide, bitter, aggressive, and unfeelingly impulsive. Most obviously, she speaks of and to her husband-- the man she claims to have loved for 18 years-- so disgustingly that I became convinced that Pagan wrote in a Gay Best Friend/brother to sidestep criticisms that the book is anti-gay. Let's be clear: Tom (her husband) tells her he's confused about his sexuality and has been going to therapy, but he still loves her and wants to make the marriage work. He hasn't cheated on her, he doesn't have feelings for anyone else, and he hasn't slept with another man in his whole life. Would this be a huge, horrible, probably marriage-ending revelation? Sure. But our supposedly kind and sunny \"heroine\" responds by stabbing her disconsolate husband with a fork and throwing him out of their apartment. She then goes into all their joint bank accounts and empties them out, sells all his furniture, and puts their apartment up for sale (\"The idea of Tom being homeless was appealing.\"). Her justification for this is that she makes more money than he does, and she paid the deposit on the apartment. Putting aside how revolting it is to treat your partner of 18 years this way for any reason, this raises a troubling gender double-standard: any housewife/mother would be entitled to a fair share after a divorce, but because he's a man who made less, he's weak and dependent and deserves homelessness.But Libby doesn't stop there! She goes to the cafe they both frequent and tells the barista that Tom has a small penis. She tells neighbors that Tom is \"trying to kill her,\" so they think he's abusive. She screams at him for being \"a control freak\" because he wants to talk to her in private about their marital problems. She wishes he had cancer. She explores at length his inadequacy as a lover and his poor response when she was struggling to conceive a child. She wonders if she \"should've known\" about his orientation because he was in the school play in high school, and by the end she can't even talk about him without calling him her \"gay ex-husband\" or her husband \"who's attracted to men.\" Eventually she expresses gratitude to him because if he hadn't come out, she'd never have gone to Puerto Rico and had sex with a far superior lover. In short, Libby's garbage personality and unrealistic, nasty responses to everything made it impossible to sympathize with her, and the book became a thankless trudge towards her supposedly-imminent death. The only thing that pleased me was that her character was so fake and flat that I can hope I never have to meet anyone like her.Issue 2: The Under-the-Tuscan-Sun-meets-Eat-Pray-Love plot did absolutely nothing for me. The book has taken on something serious-- namely, its protagonist has fatal cancer. But about a third of the way in, the author apparently decided that the story she'd set up was harsher or more difficult than the one she actually wanted to tell, so things abruptly morph into a half-baked romance novel. Libby goes to Puerto Rico and has multiple absurd brushes with death, but a wise old woman reads her palm and tells her she'll live long and prosper; then an attractive island pilot tells her it's \"not her time,\" they have sex a bunch, they confess their love for each other, and she returns to the States to get cancer treatment. After some more waffling, she starts chemo, reunites with and marries her pilot, gets pregnant (turns out her infertility was small-penis Tom's fault too!), has twins, and tells us in the chirpy valedictorian-speech epilogue that she thinks she's going to live a plenty long life with a little more treatment. What an appallingly pat ending for a story with so much heart-twisting buildup. I was twitching as I turned the final pages.The author's afterword tells us she wants to take her theme seriously due to her \"many friends\" with cancer, but this end product exploits about 8 million different real-life sources of grief: terminal illness, death of a parent, breakup/divorce, coming out to loved ones, infertility, panic attacks/anxiety, traumatic accidents (here, a plane crash), poor body image, etc. And for all this bombardment of Sad Serious Themes, we end up with an extremely ordinary story about a woman who went on a glamorous vacation to escape her woes and found a hot guy to save her from her malaise.This book was free on Amazon, yet I still feel I paid too much."}, {"userName": "Teddie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24412506-teddie", "userReview": "If you like a mildly humorous, light read....This book is about a woman who learns she has cancer (chapter 1) on the same day her husband tells her he's gay (chapter 2). Told in first person narrative, the next 33 chapters are a somewhat humorous telling of how she handles the news. I know the book was meant to be lighthearted, but frankly I thought her behaviour was rather childish. Admittedly, I've never been faced with such a diagnosis and such a bombshell confession. But I don't believe I would have run out of the doctor's office without listening to any treatment options. And I thought Libby's reaction to her husband would have been a little more understanding (and a little less vindictive) since 1) her twin brother was gay, and 2) apparently her husband was a really good guy.If you're looking for some light reading, this book might hit the spot. It's a mildly entertaining, easy read. I just happen to prefer books that I can get a little more emotionally invested in. For these reasons, I give the book three stars."}, {"userName": "Deborah Blanchard", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10737119-deborah-blanchard", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book! This is a page turner from beginning to end. I cried and I laughed, a lot. It deals with Libby, whom I adored, and taking life by storm.

It is a story about the curve balls that life can throw at us and how we choose to deal with them. It is exquisitely written and I loved the characters in this book. They are well developed and true to life, which seems to be a requirement for me. The story flows smoothly beginning to the very end, though not always smoothly for Libby. You will adore this book.

Pure fucking shit! It was an audible daily deal, and it started out good. Cancer, broken marriage, very emotional stuff. She is told her type of cancer is very bad and far enough along that there is pretty much no chance but of course they want her to do chemo and radiation and all that anyway. She watched her own mother go through that and decides to opt out. Then she goes on a short vacation before heading back home to be with her family. From the description of the book, this is where I expected her to learn some imporant thing about life but instead, she falls in love with someone else within 2 weeks time (guess she didn't care about her husband so much after all even though the first 3rd of the book is describing how much she loved him and was so devastated) I'm not sure how she fell in love with him, all the did together was basically sight see the island. Then he convinces her to do the treatment anyway so she does and it turns out the cancer wasn't too bad and the treatment isn't too bad, and she gets pregnant even though she was infertile to the point that in veto wouldn't even work for her and everything is happy and great. What a fucking cop out of an ending! And what makes it worse is not only is cancer and it's treatment dismissed as not that bad, it actually says at one point that the cancer was a gift from God and she wouldn't be where she was and in love with this new guy and happy if not for having cancer. Excuse me while I go burn a church to the ground and vent this out a bit, she was happy before! But I guess god wanted her to love someone else so instead of, oh I don't know, answering a prayer maybe? He gives her cancer to push her in the right direction. Not only was the story a pile of contradictory crap that is ment to be romantic and fails, but it actually offended me. And the title, life and other near death experiences. What the fuck does that mean? Running your car of the road and narrowly missing a tree is a near death experience. Life is not. Life always ends with death.

So often a book is chic lit but then it is so much more also. This book is about a woman that finds out she has cancer and not much chance of surviving it and comes home to tell her husband, but he inadvertently thinks she is talking about what she now knows about him, and so he confesses that yes he is gay. Uh oh.The beginning of this book was really annoying because the author kept injecting an overdose of humor that was just distracting from the story, I was about to set the book aside, but then she reduced the unnecessary humor significantly and got on with the story. She still uses humor throughout the book to lighten the story but not an overabundance of it. So what would you do if you found out you had cancer with a low probability of living very long? Would you still go through with the treatments for cancer, would you try every conceivable option to live or would you say no thank you, I will enjoy what time I do have? What would you do if your husband confessed after 18 years that he is gay, but still wants to be your best friend?This book is about savoring the moments we do have and fighting to live and giving into your fate and enjoying whatever time is available. It is a book of hope, our true connections to others in our lives, letting people help, friendships and lovers, and savoring the individual moments within our lives.

In fact, I'm probably not a good reader for this book because I've had bad news diagnoses(plural) and had \"the talks\" with doctors and nurses. So I warn away anyone who deals with chronic illness and/or life-threatening conditions. This book is NOT for you. But on top of all that, the writing is simple, the brand of humor is of the mean-spirited ridiculous type, there's no substance to the characters, and the main character screams upper-class privileged brat.If you want to know my reasons with mild spoilers, read on, but this review is more rant-like and I'm being upfront with my personal biases here. Basically, the author tried to fictionalize slash romanticize *eye roll* a cancer diagnosis for a woman who must also deal with the shock of learning her husband of 8 years is gay and the woman, Libby, rampages through and over anyone in her path on her way to coping. I can't tell if this is telling of how the author herself would react. If so, that is terrifying.Sure, it's a tough situation. Sure, Libby had the loss of her mom to cancer to influence her present day reaction, but Pagan had weak reasons to support Libby's bad behavior. Pagan essentially relied entirely on Libby's losing her mom to cancer event, which is admittedly a strong one, but people are not made up of single events and the amount of milking Pagan did with that just reminded me every time I read it that Libby had little else to properly support her actions-so Pagan had only one reason for Libby's initial decision.Like, what else made Libby into the shallow, self-centered jerk she is in the book? Who knows, because her father didn't seem to have much influence in her memories. *more eye rolls* Pagan provided background on Paul and Lizzy's growing up with a single father, which would realistically have its own trials and tribulations, but nope, it was all on the loss of her mom to cancer. If you're going to write a jerk character, write a believable jerk please. Then there's Libby's reaction to her husband, Tom, coming out to her. Pagan basically made Libby sound like a terrible human being with how she treated him. Being honest with oneself is not an easy thing, which was a message Libby seemed to be grappling with for herself, yet she never gave Tom any slack for his confession. That entire part of the book was not ok with me and basically sealed my belief that Libby is an ass, permanently. Libby essentially traipses through a month or two of her cancer post-diagnosis life acting as if it gives her a reason to be an ass to everyone around her and is extremely selfish in how she treats those around her. Again, poor Tom is the main victim of her ire. It's weird because Libby is written as being aware of her craziness, but she doesn't really change, ever. She has a martyr complex, is self-centered, shallow, and is sadly a rather true depiction of how poorly educated some healthcare consumers are and how people love to self-diagnose with Google and WebMD. It really frightens me that the author wrote such a character as Libby, because it's making me wonder about her own personality. The author's treatment of Libby and Tom's entire situation was insensitive and sending the wrong message to readers. I realize there are people like this who channel their anger outward and I know people who lash out as their coping mechanism, but I'll be honest, as someone with a chronic condition and had my own close calls, I refuse to condone such actions and think books like this send the message that using one's condition as a license to behave badly deserves a punch in the face. Lastly, what was the point of the romance? It felt thrown in for the chick audience's benefit rather than an actual meaningful point to Libby's development. I straight up hate this book, but I read through it to the end hoping for some redeeming factor and simultaneously challenging myself to see how cancer/illness is being treated in pop fiction.....AWFUL EXPERIENCE! The author does mention at the end that cancer has played a role in her life through friends and family, but how involved she was in those situations is not mentioned and based on what I read, her perspective on coping with cancer, or any life-threatening condition, is highly questionable. People who presume they understand the role of caregiver and patient and say so are fooling themselves."}, {"userName": "Aneesa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11366968-aneesa", "userReview": "I got this book in an exchange for an honest reviewFeels like forever since I wrote the review :O, the review right...Whoah!

After seventeen years of what she thought was a blissful marriage to the man of her dreams, Tom chose THAT day to tell her he... preferred men. He's lucky she only stabbed him in the hand.So begins one woman's journey to face... or to ignore... the challenges ahead of her. In a thought-provoking, but easy-reading story, Pagan allows readers to ponder how they might respond to such a diagnosis. Initially, Libby responds as though she's on her own. Her life, her decision. But is that ever the case? Our decisions always have an impact on the people we love, and on the people who love us. This isn't a depressing book, by any means.

The author couldn't have chosen a better name for the book. The biggest reason I might have requested this book was because of the title.Now, the actual review part. Life and Other Near Death Experiences is a very light- hearted novel on... CANCER. I don't know how authors find an inspiration to create romance (read, The Fault In Our Stars) or humor out of cancer, the one deadly disease wiping out mankind. But yet, Camille Pagan did it and I'm glad she did because this might be the most positive book I've read about cancer.\n  \u201cIf cancer was a gift, I wanted to return it. I didn\u2019t need a fast-acting tumor to remind me about the fleeting nature of life:\u201d\nThe first half of the book really irritated me. The story revolves around Libby Miller, an optimist, who just got to know that she is suffering from cancer and that her husband is gay. So, according to her, the beautiful life she was living just came crashing down on her. I'd have liked the concept, except Libby is a rude woman. I don't know what made her into what she was throughout the story - cancer or her husband's sexuality - but she is definitely not a character I would get along with. What irked me the most is her reaction towards her husband's coming out. She literally cut him off from her life. She embarrassed him, she kicked him out of his house and then when he was concerned about her throughout the book, she just snapped at him and ignored him. Yes, the husband you loved for the last 16 years isn't attracted to your gender, but he still loves you, not the love you expect, but still a love that is enough to care about you. I couldn't make sense of Libby's decisions or manners. Yet, I have to say, the second half of the book was a pleasant surprise. Libby was discovering herself and try to take sensible decisions. Even though she was still keeping a distance from her husband and also having an affair with a Puerto Rican, I could see why she was upset. The final quarter of the book won my heart and things finally were where it should have been.Which brings to me another aspect, which I'm not sure I actually enjoyed but I cannot bring myself to hate it either. While reading the book, I actually felt as if I am watching a movie, a romantic comedy where the heroine is running away from her problems. She ends up in an exotic destination, meets a guy, falls in love and then when reality strikes, things crumble and realizes it's time to confront our fears. I'm not saying it's bad. I loved the story, even if it was nothing new to what I have already seen or even read. But eventually I expected something more.\n  \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t care very much about everything working out perfectly, but I\u2019m not going to not take a chance because of all the what-ifs involved.\u201d\nThat being said, if a movie is ever made, I know I'm going to watch it before anyone else, because, as I'm stressing again and again, I liked the story. To create love and positivity out of cancer is really beautiful and I'm glad I ended up smiling and shedding some joy tears than crying my heart out on a tragedy.My favorite character has to be Paul. There was not a bigger support to Libby than her own twin brother. Paul represents every reason why I've always wanted a twin, analter-ego, a support and a shoulder to cry on.As for Shiloh, he was a clich\u00e9. Every love story has one, and while I'm not complaining about him, I'm not much into sugar coating him, either. Other characters were good too, but there was nobody as special as Paul.  So did you like it? Probably.  Is it anything special? No.\u00a0  But would I recommend it? Yes.\u00a0  Will you like it? That depends if you are ready to get into this with an open mind and no expectations.

On the same day Libby receives the shattering diagnosis of cancer, her husband reveals a secret that leads to Libby filing for divorce and setting off for a tropical holiday in Puerto Rico.The first few chapters of this book were comic overload, but as you progress the humor becomes more subtle, and the protagonist, Libby, turns into a well developed character. Still haunted by her mother's death of cancer when Libby and her twin brother were children, Libby makes some abrupt choices that some may find hard to relate to and that make Libby appear stubborn and selfish at times, but considering her history I felt quite connected to her. While the plot is a bit predictable, I really liked the author's style of writing and it kept my attention so that I finished this book in a day. It had a bit of everything. There were funny moments, there were sad moments, there was some romance and there were sections that really made you think about life, time, second chances and how your perceived childhood experience affects your adult life.
