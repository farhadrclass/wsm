Pagans good.\" theme that seems to offend readers so much that they miss everything else.

He suffers moments of doubt that his way is the best. I don't mean doubts about his faith/religion, but doubts about how he's decided to lead the members of his church and community. (Is religious tolerance really a slippery slope that they can't handle?)Furthermore, he struggles with the desire to be moral and create what he considers the best environment for the members of his church and his belief that he'll have to do something immoral to rid the city of the temptation he feels the members of his church are too weak to handle. Should he let them fall into sin, lose faith and suffer damnation, or sacrifice his own morality to save theirs? If this were such an easy decision for him, as it would be if he were simply evil, he would do something awful right away and we'd have a completely different novel."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "\"Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, two hundred souls at most, no more than a blip on the fast road between Toulouse and Bordeaux. Blink once, and it's gone. One main street, a double row of dun-colored half-timbered houses leaning secretively together, a few laterals running parallel like the tines of a bent fork. A church, aggressively whitewashed, in a square of little shops. Farms scattered across the watchful land.\" Magical and scrumptious, Chocolat is a thrilling delight for the senses. When Vianne Rocher and her imaginative daughter, Anouk, establish themselves and their chocolaterie in the small, French-Catholic town of Lansquenet, they are met with guarded curiosity and veiled hostility. As Vianne slowly begins to attract the townspeople with her winning combination of tantalizing chocolate creations and her warm friendship and unprejudiced acceptance, she sparks the wrath of the self-righteous and judgmental priest, P\u00e8re Reynaud. Determined to rid the town of both the river gypsies as well as the influence of Vianne Rocher, P\u00e8re Reynaud readies himself and his church for the battle between what he considers good versus evil. But, there is something quite incongruous and disturbing in his convictions. He loathes the members of his congregation: \"Sheep are not the docile, pleasant creatures of the pastoral idyll. Any countryman will tell you that. They are sly, occasionally vicious, pathologically stupid.\" He is arrogant and overly confident: \"When Vianne Rocher sees the power of the church - my influence over every single soul in the community - then she will know she has lost.\" Can Vianne and P\u00e8re Reynaud exist side by side in this small community?The story alternates between the first person narration of Vianne and P\u00e8re Reynaud, allowing the reader to become quite intimate with the innermost thoughts of these complex characters. With vivid imagery, an entertaining and eccentric cast of secondary characters, and an engaging storyline, author Joanne Harris has created a novel which satisfies not only your senses, but also your intellect. Don't let the backdrop of exquisite chocolates and other heavenly concoctions fool you into thinking there is nothing more to this novel. With its underlying themes of moral perplexities, Chocolat contains more than meets the eye. Note to potential reader: Prior to opening the pages of this book, I highly recommend that you indulge and stock up on a plentiful supply of superior chocolates to be consumed while reading. A last minute search for a leftover Hershey bar or chocolate kiss will leave you a bit disappointed."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Chocolat (Chocolat, #1), Joanne HarrisChocolat is a 1999 novel by Joanne Harris.

town, on the tail of carnival she brings with her a touch of witchcraft and huge gobs of humanity. Accompanied by her daughter, Anouk, her imaginary pet rabbit, and a wealth of knowledge not only of how to make the finest confections, but how to see into people\u2019s souls, she is destined to stir things up. The darkness to her light is the local priest, Francis Reynaud, who makes it his business to try to rid the town of this impure non-believer, and spoil her planned chocolate festival. Vianne\u2019s humanity proves decisive for many in the town, Josephine, who finds the strength to leave her abusive spouse. Gaillume eventually learns to let his sick dog Charley move on. Vianne befriends Amande, an elder practitioner of Vianne\u2019s arts, who welcomes the travelers when they arrive and are rejected by the bigots of the town. She is less successful with the dark Muscat, wife beater and perpetrator of even darker crimes. Most chapters tell Vianne\u2019s story, but some are told through the eyes of Reynaud, as he speaks of his fear, desires and crimes to his comatose predecessor. This is a clear battle between the warmth of a secular or at least non-Christian humanity against the cold disapproval of the church. Harris has made her demons quite dark, but allows a glimmer of humanity to peep through. We have a sense, at least, of why they may have fallen so far from the path of truth. Vianne is sometimes a bit too quick to judge, and if she does indeed become aware of that the fact that the author allows her a flaw or two adds to her humanity. The book was engaging, magical, both literally in its subject matter and in the beauty of its telling.

Casting a priest in the role of the villain irritated me. (I echo the others who say this is overdone.) Even so, I think the priest could have been redeemed. If only he had worked through his guilt and developed a good sense of humour and humility. But, nooo... that would never do. Because religious figures can never have true faith. *rolls eyes*And the most unforgivable sin: I never really felt anything for the characters... No love or sympathy. Except maybe Guillaume. I liked him.Also, the moral of this book seemed to be: \"Indulge yourself! Do what feels right! (Even if you consequently die/get pregnant/shame yourself forever.)\" Yeah. I'm not really digging that moral.Yet, I could not dislike this book. It was strangely addicting. Reading it was like eating a confection you know is not very good when compared with something of a higher calibre, but you keep mindlessly eating it anyway though you're not sure why.Oh!

At the beginning of my reading, it was clear why this book was turned into a movie: it had a very clear, plot-driven narrative. As I continued reading, I felt that this book was the first book I'd read that made me understand what a professor of mine meant when he explained Hemingway's Iceberg Theory: that 90% of what a writer is saying is under the surface level. This book was the opposite: everything that the reader is supposed to think is told to him/her by the narrator. It surprised me, but I got tired of being told everything and not being able to 'discover' anything as a reader. The gypsies in this novel also seemed to be completely glorified in the book, and if you have any continental European relatives with experience living in areas where gypsies live or travel through, then you know that even the most positive view of gypsies should be somewhat tempered. The final straw was when the main gypsy (Johnny Depp in the film) exclaimed \"Sanctimonious bastard!\" about the priest. I almost never hear the word 'sanctimonious' used, even among highly educated people. A gypsy using that word? Not believable. I will admit, after that part, and then seeing the movie, which I thought was infinitely better, I chose not to finish the book. Perhaps had I finished it my negative view would have been turned around; perhaps not.Overall, I would say that if you're an avid reader, skip the book and see the movie, which was fantastic.

Non sono quindi rimasta sorpresa - semmai inondata dall'acquolina - quando, sfogliando le pagine ed inghiottendo le righe di Joanne Harris ho sentito soffiare un vento di magia che \u00e8 possibile annusare nella dolce fragranza di cioccolato. Sono invece rimasta stupita dalla capacit\u00e0 letteraria di questa scrittrice di origini un po' inglesi e un po' francesi che ha saputo condire col cioccolato una storia profonda e descrivere dei personaggi che rimangono impressi nel cuore, come quando una forma stampa una torta dalla forma gustosa e bizzarra.Sullo sfondo di un paese francese, si staglia imperante il parroco Reynaud, forte della propria presa sulle coscienze paesane e del proprio potere di confessionale; a contraddirne il potere e a portare un'ondata di luce sar\u00e0 Vianne Rocher, un po' strega, un po' viandante che, con le sue esperienze di vita, la sua voglia di felicit\u00e0, il suo amore per il prossimo, scardiner\u00e0 i neri appannaggi della toga di Reynaud per restituire alla piazza di fronte alla Chiesa il colore attraverso la vetrina della sua cioccolateria. La maga Vianne e la figlia Anouk irriteranno una parte del paese, attireranno le simpatie della gente del fiume, creeranno un ritrovo per anime sconsolate bisognose di manforte per restituirsi alla vita - al contrario di quanto il parroco Reynaud fa in nome della legge di Dio, con il suo continuo oscurare i desideri quasi fossero il cartellino giallo per essere espulsi dal Cielo.338 pagine che si alternano tra avvenimenti e ricordi, smosse da un vento magico, quasi esotico, che sembra dirottare la vita dei personaggi, e sembra quasi voler suggerire una risposta al pindarico quesito:'Ci vuole pi\u00f9 coraggio a restare, o pi\u00f9 coraggio a rimanere?' A rispondere sar\u00e0 il finale, toccante, melodico, elegantemente architettato e lontano dai risultati che il lettore si attende di ottenere.Un libro che \u00e8 un inno alla vita, a tutte le sue tonalit\u00e0, alla forza di rialzarsi e di imporsi sui propri passi, mentre si impara che l'odia fomentato da una religione e dai pregiudizi \u00e8 peggio del fiammifero buttato sulla steppa che dilaga dando fuoco a quanto di costruttivo pu\u00f2 esistere in tutto ci\u00f2 che ci si impone di non conoscere per l'incapacit\u00e0 di 'vedere oltre'.Il continuo scontrarsi di una lotta tra diversit\u00e0 destinata a finire in cenere per celebrare poi l'unica cosa vera che conta in questa vita: la felicit\u00e0.Se siete disposti ad infrangere qualsiasi credo stizzoso, borioso, trito e ritrito, e, sopratutto, a macchiarvi del peccato di gola; se state cercando una storia che odora di cibo invitante, ma anche di speranza e di magia; se vi volete staccare dal conformismo per arrivare a 81 anni e amare ancora la vita come se ne aveste 20, allora 'Chocolat' \u00e8 esattamente il romanzo che vi attende."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/957144-becky", "userReview": "I did not like this book.

I thought the book was anti-religious and anti-Catholic, specifically. I am not of the thought or feeling that anyone has to be religious by any means, people can believe what they want. But when those of different belief systems have to put down others to make themselves feel wise or superior (ie, refer to religious people as those who believe in fairy tales), it is counter productive to the message that we should all be accepting of others' differences (as I thought was a main theme of the book), and turns the author and main character into hypocrites."}, {"userName": "Nat K", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35251024-nat-k", "userReview": "Simply magical."}, {"userName": "Edith Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/339837-edith-fischer", "userReview": "I liked the style, alternating chapters narrated by the heroine,chocolate shop owner Vianne Rocher, and her nemesis, the village priest.

Happiness. Simple as a glass of chocolate or torturous as the heart. Bitter. Sweet. Alive.\"If you've watched the movie from a few years back and you've only decided just now to pick up the book where the movie was based on, prepare to be surprised (although in what way exactly, I leave it to you). I can hardly believe that a novel so richly packed with meaning could be so relatively short. Harris' prose here is at its finest, as we follow the narratives of Vianne, the free-spirited chocolate-creating witch, and Reynaud, the guilt-stricken oppressive village priest. Young widow Vianne Roche's mouthwatering bonbons, steaming mugs of liqueur-laced cocoa and flaky cream-filled patisserie don't earn her a warm welcome from the stern prelate of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. In Francis Reynaud's zeal to enforce strict Lenten vows of self-denial, he regards his sybaritic neighbor with suspicion and disdain. It is Lent, the priest has decreed abstinence, deprivation. Yet, Vianne's shop is a \"red-and-gold confection,\" her window a proliferation of truffles, pralines, candied fruits, hazelnut clusters, candied rose petals, all there to tempt Reynaud's parishioners. He sees it as a disgrace, a degradation of the faith, and eventually preaches against Vianne from his pulpit.Undaunted, Vianne garners support from the town's eccentrics, chiefly Armande Voizin, the oldest living resident, a self-professed sorceress who senses in Vianne a kindred spirit. A fun-loving band of river gypsies arrives, and a colorful pageant unfurls.Each narrative is uniquely told, with personality quirks inherent to each, and each narrative can be subtly imperfect - Reynaud slowly descends into madness, as does his precise narrative; Vianne's fear of weakness and displacement causes her to falsely claim that she never cries, causes her to state a yearning to move on which does not exist, and causes her to doubt her own importance to her lover Roux - creating a tantalizing problem for the reader: do we believe Vianne or do we believe Roux and his actions? The problem is - like Vianne's chocolates - delicate and bitter-sweet, with possibilities abounding on either side.Beautifully drawn characters become very real. My favorites were Anouk, Vianne's utterly delightful child (not to be without her imaginary rabbit friend, Pantoufle); Guillaume who comes out of his shell after the death of his beloved dog, Charly; and of course Mme. Armande Voizin who was reunited with her grandson even under the close scrutiny of her self-important daughter. I was most touched in a jarring way of the domestic conflict between Josephine Muscat and that of her husband. I cheered for her when she finally found the inner strength to leave him for good and live her own life. \"Places all have their characters, and returning to a city you've lived before is like coming home to an old friend. No, places do not lose their identity, however far one travels. It is the heart that begins to erode after a time.\"A surprising yet fitting denouement caps this deftly told tale of lust, greed and love. Francophiles will be drawn to the evocative descriptions of daily village life, while gourmands revel in the mouth-watering descriptions of chocolate preparation. \"Chocolat\" is a heart warming and enjoyable story.

I remember reading a part about someone watching videos, but the idea of a priest being upset over people eating chocolate seems so bizarrely anachronistic that I assumed it couldn't be set anywhere near modern times.

I discarded books left and right, I was in the mood for something literary and after re-watching the movie - I settled on this one. I decided to savor it as one would a piece of chocolate, slowly, letting it melt into my mouth so that I could absorb the flavor better.The book is similar to the movie and yet very different - surprisingly I like both in their own way. It was a beautiful novel, full of magic, luscious descriptions of chocolate and other confections, and human relationships. It was hard to remember that this novel is set in modern times and not back in the day. I think I prefer the movie villain as the book's villain is a bit too typical. Father Francis is everything I despise about the church and the reason I no longer go, a man convinced of his own piety and holiness while blaming everyone for their sins without actually attempting to save them. I especially can't forgive him for Josephine. The bastard knew what her husband did to her and yet he still pleaded for her to go back to him, until the husband shows his colors in public. How's leaving your extremely abusive husband breaking the sanctity of marriage, but beating your wife acceptable? And of course, everyone in town knows and no one does anything until it's almost too late. Sanctimonious assholes.The novel ends on a bittersweet note and yet there is a promise of good things to come.

There is so much of racism in the World today, that Vianne's fight for the Gypsies to be accepted in that little town comes as a breath of fresh, heady air, much like Vianne herself.I also liked the idea of good fun in a very tight, moralistic society, the entire town seemed to have let their hair down and had fun. Good food, lots of music and dancing and tons of Chocolate too. It was as if on that Easter the town had renewed itself. There is always a catalyst on such occasions and Vianne was the flute of champagne in that uptight little town, opening a lot of minds and sweeping away the cobwebsWhat a beautiful book."}, {"userName": "Rick Slane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17459218-rick-slane", "userReview": "A Lenten Easter treat.

description of chocolate to melt in the mouths of chocoholics, francophiles, armchair gourmets, cookbook readers, and lovers of passion everywhere.Illuminating Peter Mayle's South of France with a touch of Laura Esquivel's magic realism, Chocolat is a timeless novel of a straitlaced village's awakening to joy and sensuality. In tiny Lansquenet, where nothing much has changed in a hundred years, beautiful newcomer Vianne Rocher and her exquisite chocolate shop arrive and instantly begin to play havoc with Lenten vows. Each box of luscious bonbons comes with a free gift: Vianne's uncanny perception of its buyer's private discontents and a clever, caring cure for them. Is she a witch? Soon the parish no longer cares, as it abandons itself to temptation, happiness, and a dramatic face-off between Easter solemnity and the pagan gaiety of a chocolate festival. Chocolat's every page offers a description of chocolate to melt in the mouths of chocoholics, francophiles, armchair gourmets, cookbook readers, and lovers of passion everywhere.
