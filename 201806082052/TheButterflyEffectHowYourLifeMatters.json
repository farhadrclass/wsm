You have been createdas one of a kind. You have been created in order to make a difference.You have within you the power to change the world.\u201dA n d y A n d r e w sThe book was an unexpected delight and at the same time unexpectedly short. I\u2019m all ready wanting to buy this book for my nephew. It\u2019s inspirational showing the effects of small, every day people who chose to do the right thing and in turn their actions saved lives in future generations. One man\u2019s actions saved our country. I don\u2019t think people realize how every action is important from the conversation you had with a woman at the grocery store to life decisions you make. Your action has a reaction. This book shows how God designed each of us for a purpose, and when you look at the whole picture it is amazing to see how the dominoes fall.The Butterfly Effect begins like a history lesson, but reads like a novel. I would encourage you not to skip over the Author\u2019s Note. It is very interesting. Give it away to someone who needs to see that their life matters. So much of the time we go through every day without realizing our value in God\u2019s eyes. We are much more than just a grocery store clerk, a government employee, an IRS man, or a custodian. Won\u2019t you spread your wings and beat the air and take a chance on life?From The Publisher: The decisions you make and the way you treat others have more impact than you may ever realize.Speaker and New York Times best-selling author Andy Andrews shares a compelling and powerful story about a decision one man made over a hundred years ago, and the ripple effect it\u2019s had on us individually, and nationwide, today. It\u2019s a story that will inspire courage and wisdom in the decisions we make, as well as affect the way we treat others through our lifetime. Andrews speaks over 100 times a year, and The Butterfly Effect is his #1 most requested story.Also included with the purchase of the book is a link to view a 9-minute message of Andrews telling The Butterfly Effect story to a live audience.

Achieving this goal lead me to select The Butterfly Effect by Andy Andrews. This book starts out on a simple scientific theory that was once believed to be nonsense when it was first introduced. The Butterfly Effect is a theory that contends that the motion of a butterflies wings while in flight has the power to eventually cause a hurricane. Please note that I am simplifying the theory because I try to avoid writing spoilers.Andy Andrews uses a historical example to show how one person's actions can effect human kind in ways that are not easily seen or imagined at that the time the event occurs. There are three examples of how human thought and interaction helped to impact the lives of billions of people on a global scale.This is a great take a break type book. It is colorfully illustrated, the story line is interesting and at the end of story, if you are not questioning what effect your actions are having on the common good, then you've totally missed the point of The Butterfly Effect"}, {"userName": "\u2665 Ibrahim \u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1178748-ibrahim", "userReview": "In the beginning, I liked the book and was enchanted by the story of the butterfly effect, the parable itself.

I have been living that way from early childhood and please spare me your syrupy, fluffy, melodramatic, patriotic stories\".

It demonstrates the effect one life \u2014 one decision really \u2014 can have on hosts of people across time. By the end of the book, you understand Andy\u2019s point \u2014 everything you do matters. Every move each of us makes will always have an effect on someone (even if that someone is ourselves), rippling into the future. Essentially, our lives have a unique purpose because no matter how far into the future we have to go, we will find someone who has been affected by our actions. So we need to live every moment with that in mind.There\u2019s a lot of good history in this book, and it definitely makes you think about the permanence of your actions, big and small. However, I almost felt like it was too much pressure to think about. Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019ve never heard Andy Andrews speak before. I know the goal is to show people their importance in this world, but there\u2019s a certain magnitude that comes from thinking that every single thing you do has a far-reaching scope. Taken positively, it could be a very comforting reminder that you are important in the scope of the world. I simply feel that you have to be careful not to look at not-so-great past actions with too much negative pressure.I think this layout is great for young adults or as a gift. It is a very simple book \u2014 it takes very little time to read. It really is a nice book, very encouraging for those who need a reminder that their actions can (and do) have positive consequences."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb", "userReview": "I saw this and was curious about the story of the solitary Union solider who's actions at Gettysburg were credited with changing the fate of our nation.

The book basically offers to the reader the concept that would later become known unofficially as The Butterfly Effect and how it came to be accepted by science in the most basic retelling that can be given for a scientific event. Then following that the author gives a few good examples from history of people who may be considered butterflies and how their lives how affected certain events not only in the United States but also worldwide. Short, easy-to-follow and understand this will be a quick read for those who need an inspiring pick-me-up.

The butterfly effect is a part of chaos theory and in essence states that when a butterfly flaps their wings on this side of the world, it makes a tornado happen on the other side of the world. The butterfly doesn't cause the tornado per se, but without that flapping of the wings that particular tornado would not have existed in that time and space, so the butterfly was essential in that tornado's formation... Anyway, enough about theories and on to the books...In \u201cThe Boy Who Changed The World\u201d, he illustrates this effect through the story of Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel Peace prize in 1970 for creating seeds that were able to withstand harsh conditions and thus increased peace by increasing food supply to poor nations. By going backwards in time and seeing who the people were who stimulated him to create the seeds and who inspired or helped them, the author shows that everything that we do is very important, and even little things matter. Also, we will never know how even a simple little action will lead to bigger things in the future. In \u201cThe Butterfly Effect\u201d these stories are explained in more detail, and others are interwoven so we truly see how the flapping of the wings of our decisions today can have an influence half-way around the world tomorrow. Through these two books, Andy Andrews is encouraging children and adults alike to believe that what they do has an impact, and to make good use of their talents and influence, because we all have the power to change the world.I have been encouraged by these books, because sometimes I don't see the effect I am having through what I am doing and so become discouraged. It helps to realise that we will often not know what our influence on others will be and how God will use it to change things in the long run. This helps me to press on!!Also, I am looking forward to using the book \u201cThe Boy Who Changed The World\u201d with the children at the Children\u2019s Home (it will have to be translated as it is read to them!) to encourage them that their lives are also important and show them that they can impact other\u2019s lives even in the little things that they do. I would recommend it for any parents to use with their children. \u201cThe Butterfly Effect\u201d is a great gift book for any special occasion, and will be an encouragement to everyone who reads it.

The first tale details the heroic efforts of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain at the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War. Chamberlain, a man who refused to do nothing, ordered a historic charge that allowed Union forces to win the battle, when a Confederate victory could have decisively changed the history of the United States and the 20th Century. The second story Andrews presents is the chain of effects that led to the development of hybridized high yield, disease resistant corn by Norman Borlaug, a historical figure likely not to be familiar to most readers. Borlaug\u2019s creation has saved billions from famine. But Andrews asks was it Borlaug\u2019s efforts that led to the saving of more than two billion or was it the small efforts of others that lead to Borlaug\u2019s work. Andrews shows that as the Butterfly Effect argues, all of our smallest actions have impacts, and Andrews inspiringly shows that those little things have long term impacts.This is a gift book, so it\u2019s short. To be honest I have thought about this book for more time than it took for me to read it. The book is visually pleasing starting at the cover, with a shiny butterfly graphic. As the great philosopher Jeff Foxworthy once argued, men are attracted to shiny things. The pages are more graphical than textual. I\u2019m not a huge fan of gift books, but I found myself satisfied with The Butterfly Effect and am glad I took the time to read and reflect on it.Review Copy provided by Thomas Nelson"}, {"userName": "Lenore Webb", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2651311-lenore-webb", "userReview": "'Butterfly Effect' that Andy has also written. We do not always see that what we do will be the next step for someone else. I am sure you have seen it in your own life in one way or the other. Small things. Like growing up my mom woke me by saying \"Morning Glory\" to me each day. Of course, I said it to my own College Girl when she was a child. Now all three of us will sit on our porch and watch the Morning Glories grow and each share in the love we have passed from one to the other. Small but it is something we all adore. I am even having a glass tile pendent of a Morning Glory made for College Girl's Christmas present. Now this is a tradition passed down. But in raising my daughter to be who she is, it is likely that one day she may teach (it is in the plans). In teaching she can touch a life of a growing mind, maybe one who will make a new discovery or change or notice life just that quarter turn different than most do. And on the effects pass. You also touch many lives each day. From your own family to neighbors to members at church to that person you wave at as you go for your daily walk.

Mr. Andrews illustrates this point with the story of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a Colonel in the Union Army. It was July 2, 1863, in Gettysburg, PA. Colonel Chamberlain and his men were attacked over and over and are down to almost nothing when he tells them to charge. The results of that charge are amazing! Then, there is the example of Norman Borlaugh and his work with hybridized high yield, disease resistant corn and wheat for arid climates. It has saved millions of people. But, was it really just Norman?There is an actual \"Butterfly Effect,\" and I enjoyed reading how it went from something scientists thought was laughable to a scientific fact called, \"The Law of Sensitive Dependence Upon Initial Conditions.\" It is a quick read that will change your philosophy about the seemingly inconsequential things in life.

Case in point. During the Battle of Gettysburg, the Rebel soldiers outnumbered the Union soldiers and killed many in battle, but due to the split second action of one particular colonel, a group of 80 Union soldiers captured over 300 Confederate troops in effect turning the tide of the Civil War moreso into the hands of the Union and keeping it intact.

Yet, because of free porn sights, all of their work is easily attainable by anyone, anytime, forever. It makes it difficult to have a career outside of the sex industry without being discovered. The author reveals several stories of former porn actors who got out of the business and tried to lead normal careers, only to be outed by internet porn fans.Then there is the Ashley Madison hacking scandal. It turns out, very few women populated the site, making it improbable male users actually carried out affairs. Most of the \u201cwomen users\u201d were in reality, bots. Men would spend hours having sexual conversations online with bots. One of the tragic butterfly effects involved a Baptist Seminary professor who killed himself after being exposed.

I don't know why I took so long to pick it up."}, {"userName": "Paul Caris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36105489-paul-caris", "userReview": "Great reminder Take 20 minutes and read this book right now.
