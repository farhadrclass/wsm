I love them all. I love Bree and Samson. It makes me want to have a rescue dog. You can read the author's words and descriptions of the area in the Upper Pennisula and you feel as cold as they are in the snow. I love the author for that fact. You feel like you are really there. The story lines are good in that you never know what is going to happen next. There is always an interesting turn in the story.I love Samson and hearing her talk about the rescue dogs and how they work. It is a series well worth reading. I have just started the Aloha Reef series. Can't wait to see what is in store in Hawaii."}, {"userName": "KRISTEN LAWRENCE", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30606924-kristen-lawrence", "userReview": "Nice seriesThis was a good series. Although they were understandable as individual stand alone books. There were a variety of subjects in addition to the search and rescue, to keep it interesting--animal conservation, Finnish culture, autism--to name a few. Parts were predictable, and parts were ridiculous (spoiler)...undiagnosed twins, but Bree deserved her happy ending, right!?"}, {"userName": "Maria Kulscar", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25621623-maria-kulscar", "userReview": "Hated to put it down.
