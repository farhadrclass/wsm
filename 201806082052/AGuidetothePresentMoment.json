The entire book discusses how important it is for us to question our feelings whenever we experience any type of animosity / guilt / anger / sadness. Our minds tend to automatically jump to conclusions / judge people / make us feel a certain way, and sometime if we just take a second to stop and question whether there is a reason why we may feel this way, it will help us change our feelings toward a subject. I think what is important to remember the next time you have a strong feeling toward a subject is just question your feeling and ask if there is a reason why someone did this action. Sometimes questioning yourself allows you to see that maybe you were overreacting / misinterpreting something and you will ultimately feel much better. Our feelings have a mind of their own and unless we question them, they are sometimes uncontrollable."}, {"userName": "Mario MJ Perron", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26991877-mario-mj-perron", "userReview": "Taking the stress out of self-doubt.To date, this has been the best method for me. Noah's method of repetition throughout the chapters connected me back to the main idea of disbelieving my thoughts. Practice through repetition sets the solid foundation for his method of eliminating self-Doubt, anger, and fear. Accepting that our thoughts cause our emotions (bad feelings & judgements) can be difficult, but as the chapters progress, I found it easier to question those thoughts, and in some cases disbelieve them or come to understand where they came from. Which lead to not feeling so bad about them at all. I often try to take one strong habit from each method I explore, in this one I took many. Try the practice of eliminating the word \"should\" from your thoughts and vocabulary. For me, it was an eye opener and a great way to pause and reflect on my thoughts. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did and get what you want from the methods. It's been a great moment in my present and a great tool for letting go of my past and my future. Thank you, Noah!M."}, {"userName": "Clark R Baker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27921894-clark-r-baker", "userReview": "Very repetitiveVery repetitivecould have been summarized into 50 pages. used the same examples over and over again so I skipped ahead to the end!"}, {"userName": "Alakshendra Yadav", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18168721-alakshendra-yadav", "userReview": "Reading this book and watching Noah's videos on YouTube have been two of the most meaningful things I have done in my life in order to find happiness. The book helped me to start this spiritual journey which has been responsible for the increase in my overall happiness and emotional peace. At the time of writing this review, I'm almost 21, and a few months ago, the only time I could remember being truly happy was during my childhood. I took it for a fact that that kind of happiness only exists in humans as a child and that rest of my life is going to be stressful and full of mental suffering, like witnessing the lives of most people in our society leads us to believe. This book changed my perception of life, consciousness, and emotions in a very profound manner, and though I'm just beginning the practice of regular meditation and giving myself time to observe my thoughts neutrally and recognizing the difference between me and my thoughts, I can confidently say that I have started to experience peace for longer time periods and that I have begin to live my life by actually being in the moment, and not in the story that my thoughts are telling me. Now I love more, laugh more, have more meaningful conversations, and enjoy the little things happening in life better. I'd suggest reading this book along with watching Noah's videos and also the book 'Waking Up' by Sam Harris as a good start to one's spiritual journey."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/587592-jane", "userReview": "Fantastic!

Noahs videos are extremely powerful and they are on his youtube channel, I found those first and they are pretty much everything in this book. His videos to me were more helpful than the book but that may have been because I knew what was coming in the book due to me watching the videos.

I rarely don't finish books. The main take away I got from the little I read was that I don't have to let one shitty moment ruin my day. I can be upset about the thing but not walk around with a little cloud over my head for the rest of the day. My biggest issue with this book was that it seemed a little too victim blamey. He expands on the fact that none of us are perfect so how can we judge others for \"imperfect behavior\" when we don't know what the right behavior is? He talks about how as a society we accept things that are \"wrong\" (the author uses quotation marks around bad behavior, good behavior, wrong, and right) but are they *really*?It sounded a lot like he was condoning emotional and physical abuse on a level of \"my emotions about the thing is what's upsetting me. Not the actual action of the other person\". There's a huge difference between not being happy because you want a new car instead of recognizing that you're blessed to have a car, and being unhappy because you're in a dangerous situation.I understand that people make their own happiness, and that's something to remember. I tried reading it with a grain of salt but I couldn't do the apples to oranges comparison any longer. Maybe people will shit on me for this review, because it seems to be a popular book, and maybe they won't. Who knows? And do I care? Not really. I get the point he was trying to make and I'm going to take his ill worded point and make it suit my own situation in life. This book could be potentially dangerous in the wrong hands and in the wrong situation.Now onto the actual book:Homeboy needs an editor something fierce. He also needs to take some classes on writing. Though in his defense he did state at the beginning that he isn't a writer. What little I did read it was like he was repeating the same thing over and over again. This whole thing could have been edited down to a 20 page essay as opposed to an entire book."}, {"userName": "Thomas Fetters", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30609456-thomas-fetters", "userReview": "Worth the Journey!Sometimes the destination is so much sweeter than the journey. The long car ride home to get back to your family from a 3 day business trip for example. At times this book made it hard to continue reading. It took me awhile to soak in and digest the material, but at times it also felt redundant. Maybe the point could be made much quicker? I found myself reading it in little chunks having to go back to it time and time again as I devoured other material. The content is deep and meaningful if you are willing to apply its suggested principles. I recommend picking it up and being patient with it if you find yourself in a less then desirable situation or maybe just trying to deal with the day to day grind. There is useful information for anyone willing to give it a try. In the end, it made the journey well worth it."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12003917-mark", "userReview": "I am kind of torn in trying to write a review for this book. There are many VERY good ideas and lots of useful information in this book. The downside is that a good editor could have made it so much more readable and enjoyable with far fewer words. So many points are repeated numerous times unnecessarily in my opinion. I found myself skimming over sections which took pages to make a good point that could have been written in a paragraph or less.

Those in the throes of emotional turmoil probably can't sit down, read the book and benefit from it.

Your Unwanted Emotions Are Created By Thoughts, Not By FactsIf your romantic partner isn't cheating, but you think that they are, how do you feel? Hurt. If your romantic partner is cheating, but you think that they love you, how do you feel? Great. If your child isn't injured, but you think that they got hurt, how do you feel? Sad. If your child is injured, but you think they are safe at a friend's house, how do you feel? Fine. If you aren't going to get fired next week, but you think that you'll be fired, how do you feel? Fearful. If you are going to get fired next week, but you think that your job is safe, how do you feel? Great.When the facts are \"good\", but you think they are \"bad\", you suffer. When the facts are \"bad\", but you think they are \"good\", you are happy. This demonstrates that the facts don't create your happiness or suffering. It is only your thoughts that create your emotions.A Powerful 5-Step Process That Can Immediately Bring You More PeaceDo you want to stop living with stress, unworthiness, social anxiety, insecurity, anger, or sadness? It certainly seems as though these emotions are inevitable, and directly created by our circumstances, our situations, and the people in our lives. However, it is possible to discover that all your unwanted emotions are actually created by the thoughts in your mind. More importantly, each of these emotions can vanish in an instant if you just stop believing the thoughts that create them.When You Don't Believe Words, Those Words Don't Create EmotionsIf a random person tells you, \"The world is going to end tomorrow\", and you believe them, how would you feel? You would likely experience fear. But if you didn't believe them at all, then how would their comment make you feel? You almost certainly wouldn't be emotionally affected. This demonstrates that when you believe someone's words to be true, those words create emotions. But if you don't believe someone's words, those same words don't have the power to create emotions.The same is true of the words (thoughts) in your mind. If you believe a negative thought about yourself or your life, that thought will create an unwanted emotion. However, if you don't believe that thought, it quite simply won't create the unwanted emotion.This Book Will Show You How To Disbelieve The Thoughts That Create Your Unwanted EmotionsAs soon as you stop believing a thought that is creating one of your unwanted emotions, that emotion will instantly dissolve. As you disbelieve more and more of the thoughts that create your suffering, you will be happier in more and more situations, the more you will be living in the moment, and the more peace, freedom, love, laughter, wholeness, enthusiasm, and gratitude you will experience in your life.This Book Will Help You To:- Experience peace in situations that used to be filled with anxiety and stress - Lose the sense of lack in your life, and live with a sense of a wholeness and completeness- Put an end to your feelings of unworthiness and insecurity- Enjoy less arguments, resentment, and disappointment in your relationships with others- Experience the freedom to act how you feel without worrying about others' opinions- Live in the moment or live the power of now - Experience the fulfillment you have been searching for", "title": "A Guide to the Present Moment", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355366903l/16498123.jpg", "reviews": 31, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6705865.Noah_Elkrief", "name": "Noah Elkrief"}], "type": ["Self Help", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Spirituality"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22416790-an-introduction-to-how-to-live-in-the-moment"]}
