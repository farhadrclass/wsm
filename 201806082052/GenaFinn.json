I\u2019ve always had characters who live in my head and mess with my heart and tell me stories, and I love it.\u201dThis review contains *spoilers*.The first half of this book pleasantly surprised me with how much I liked it. Reading it was so much fun, I\u2019ve never read a book that contains blog posts, emails, texts and even fanfics with fanart. The format of this book was just altogether great. This follows the online friendship between Gena (short for Genevieve) and Finn (short for Stephanie), who share a passion for Up Below, a buddy cop TV show with a hilarious and devoted fan following.I did get a bit confused at first about who Gena and who Finn was, but once I got that sorted the story unraveled smoothly. And I just loved how natural their conversations felt at the beginning.Another great highlight was when the two of them met up at the Up Below convention in Chicago. And Finn got to meet her favorite!!\n  And when they were sitting at the Zack and Toby panel (where the stars talk about the show and acting and answer questions from the audience), and Toby said, \u201cIn the back there. Isn\u2019t that Genny Goldman?\u201d my mouth opened so widely and even more so when Zack followed Genna.

And I was finally hopeful, only to turn to the next page and see that the story was over. Damn, this has happened just too many times.Overall, this book was not what I was expecting, for better or worse.*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

The concept intrigued me so much that I bought it almost as soon as it was out. I am a sucker for stories about online friendships, being someone who spends a lot of time on the Internet herself, and I've always loved books written in unusual formats (especially informal ones like texts and emails.) So I read the synopsis and thought, what could possibly go wrong? And, truth to be told, the book starts off in the best way possible. The online fandom is represented in an extremely accurate way (and I bet I'm not the only one who thought it really, really resembled the Supernatural fandom. We are on a whole new level of crazy!), with all the fanfictions, fanarts and fandom wars. That's the way it is. I also liked how the two main characters, Gena and Finn, had different approaches to the fandom; while Gena was fairly popular and people in real life knew she was a part of it, Finn had quite a lot of unpopular opinions, and didn't tell anyone about her \"double life.\" I feel like, at some point in our lives, most of us have been both. So, things were going well. Gena and Finn get to know each other, and they each have their own problems to solve; Gena is about to start college, and has a complicated relationship with her ex-boyfriend, and Finn struggles to find a job, and is trying to balance her fandom life with her real life and her boyfriend. I must say that I never felt any kind of romantic chemistry between the two. They worked well enough as friends, but to me, they never felt like anything more. (And all the relationships in the book were... kind of strange. Most of them were really unhealthy, based on lies and manipulation, which is another thing I really disliked.)But still, up to this point, I was enjoying the book alright. I mean, I didn't go into it thinking it was going to be a life-changing novel, and it met my expectations of a cute and sometimes funny book. And then the thing happened; I call this The Fault in Our Stars Complex. Which is, basically, when you have a funny unpretentious book and then the author goes out of their way to turn it into a huge pile of DRAMA. And I fucking hate drama. It is, in fact, the main problem I have with contemporary in general. I'm not saying that horrible things do not happen in real life, because they do, and pretty often too. What I'm saying is, that going into a book like this one, the reader clearly does not want to read about depressing things like death, illness and loss. You just don't want to. Authors need to pick a goddamn genre. You either write a cutesy love story or a dramatic and meaningful one, but you can't turn the first into the second so suddenly that you leave your readers confused, and having no idea what just happened. And the drama lasted for so damn long. There was a lot of terrible poetry on Gena's part (which made me think about the time I read November 9... and we don't talk about that) and, in the end, Finn also resulted extremely selfish and silly. I'm giving this book two stars instead of one solely because I enjoyed the first half of it, but right now I am feeling truly disappointed. I do not recommend it."}, {"userName": "emily", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10820397-emily", "userReview": "[ At some point Gena admits to having a crush or even being in love with Finn. In a romantic way, I assumed, which I thought was AWESOME. And earlier in the book she had a relationship with a guy which means she's bisexual which is even MORE AWESOME. Bi girls are so important. And it sounded like Gena had had crushes on other girls before. But it was honestly really confusing how she felt towards Finn. I could never actually tell if the love was platonic or romantic and her gay side was really played down which sucks. At the end she seems to meet a boy she likes which sucks. And I have no fucking clue about Finn. She says she loves and needs Gena but is still going to marry her boyfriend, probably in the undetermined future. I don't know if Finn is also bisexual or this really  really  intense love she has for Gena is just platonic or she's just in denial because honestly there's no way that love is platonic. And that makes me so mad. That the whole book built up their relationship from Internet strangers to actual friends to maybe having feelings for each other but then brushing all of that to the side and finding each girl a nice boy. Screw that. You know what, I am mad. This should have ended with them together. Or even leaving that up for interpretation. Or SOMETHING. Do SOMETHING with these girls' sexualities, for Christ's sake. This was the perfect opportunity to represent other sexualities besides heterosexuality in young girls which is something  really really important to do in YA that really no one is doing, honestly  but these authors for some reason fricked it up and shied away from what could have been a really cool ending to make this yet another heteronormative book. You could say there was representation through Gena and Finn's love but honestly it was not clear if it was romantic and I am not counting this as representation and no one else should.

Everyone in fandom culture knows what \"/\" means. And yet, for some reason...when it comes to this book, it doesn't mean that? Gena and Finn have an INTENSE relationship, the kind of relationship I've definitely had with other fandom people. You meet and have this instaconnection and you already have the fandom in common and it's so easy, and then it just blooms from there. I have been there. I've felt it. And, you know, then I married my wife. But even if I leave my personal history out of this, the book seemed like it was leading to a queer relationship between Gena and Finn. Or hell, even Gena and Finn AND Charlie (Finn's boyf). I would've been super happy with that! But instead of getting the queer relationship the title and, IMO, the first three-quarters of the book, promise us, we...have Finn deciding she's going to marry Charlie after all. And we don't even have the vague promise of a poly relationship because nope, Gena's suddenly enamored of this boy in her trauma group. And Finn's jealous of them but appears to be fine just being with Charlie? And now the fact that Finn called Gena \"kid\" throughout the book is kinda creepy, whereas in the beginning I thought it was cute because it mimicked the Jake/Tyler dynamic. But at the end, Finn and Charlie pretty much treat Gena as their actual kid??? Like, she had a breakdown and suddenly all her autonomy is gone, and she's not allowed to be in a relationship with Finn anymore? I don't know.I found the whole resolution of this book very strange. It didn't tie together. Normally I'm A-OK with ambiguous endings, but this wasn't so much ambiguous as, \"Hey, so the whole premise and all the plotlines we spent the entire book building are now shot and in these last 10 pages we're going to take everyone in new directions.

The characters felt real and their fannishness was so true to my experience of fandom--in terms of talking about emotions by discussing fandom events and fannish favorite characters, the intensity you can build in a relationship with someone online, how distancing it can be to keep aspects of your fannishness secret from a non-fannish partner as Finn does keeping her fannish intensity from Charlie... all of that rang SO true. The depiction of a character, Gena, who has a handle on managing her mental illness and past trauma was also really refreshing. I hated the middle development and especially the ending. Learning that Gena was a child star who had costarred on a tv show with the actor who plays one of the two dudes on her fannish-obsession tv show felt very forced. There's a lot to say about how fans interact with their fannish objects, but this made it feel weird to me, and the emotional weight of the book lost a lot of steam as Finn and Gena's correspondence and relationship took a back seat to plot about Gena's upcoming guest appearance on their show.The last quarter of the book pulls even further away from the emotional core of the novel. We learn that an explosion happened on set the day Gena was there. We're not sure how it happened, but the actor she had known and who played one of the show's main characters dies, and Gena is hospitalized and spends the rest of the book pretty much incapacitated with trauma from it while Finn and Charlie host her and try their best to keep up with her medical bills. I don't have a problem with the notion of putting characters through the wringer in a novel. However, in this case the trauma distances the characters from one another and obscures the ways their relationships chance to one another in response. We see Finn journaling with increasing anxiety about Gena's health, and Gena's pieces of the book descend into poetry (I personally don't like poetry, particularly as narrative device, so I didn't bother to put in the work reading between the lines on her bits). We don't see them come through this difficult situation together--instead, they're awkwardly living together at the end of the book, emotionally estranged, and instead of taking an opportunity to explore the possibilities of deep platonic attachment and love between two people (which is very common in fandom!), we see a weird ending where the two women no longer have fandom in common and only know how to relate to one another in spiky anxiety anymore. It felt like an emotional cop-out from either having an actual queer romance or having an interesting relationship, and felt like the end result is that fandom might just not be worth it anyhow?I dunno. I think think there are so many interesting stories to tell about fandom and the people who create it. We didn't need this story to resort to Gena knowing the actors personally to explore the emotional connection two women can build over a shared interest. We didn't need the actor to die and Gena to be implicated in the explosion to explore mental illness, trauma, PTSD, and the fannish network of survival, found family, and care. These plot devices detracted from rather than supporting the strengths of this book.Also, side note--I know it's a YA novel and we have to Keep Those Clean or whatever, but... why do we always have fannish representation that is afraid to engage with sexually explicit fanfic and the ways people connect to it? It seems like every mainstream novel about fangirls is keen to make sure their characters only write gen. Which, many people DO only write gen! But.This book was SO readable, the characters sparkled at the beginning and felt SO true to fannish life, and was set up SO well. I'm disappointed that the authors chose to go the dramatic direction they did rather than keep with a good thing."}, {"userName": "Selene Matheson ", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22492662-selene-matheson", "userReview": "BookTube-A-Thon Challenege 2016 #3 Read a book you discovered through BookTube.

So I've downgraded it to 3 stars.I'm marking this as a 3 star rating. The first half was SO fantastic and just read like all the amazing conversations I've had with my very best online friends. I was literally LOL'ing and smiling at that beautifully familiar magic you find in true internet friendships. The format of the book is also very creative and lovely. All of it is told through blog posts (in a tumblr/live journal sort of style), emails, text messages, letters, physical journals, instant messaging, etc. It made the pages fly by and I LOVED it.Until we got about halfway through. I think I would be less upset if this hadn't been advertised as a queer read with implied romance between the two main characters. I mean we all know the meaning behind \"name / name\" do we not? But this is not a queer read, let a lone a queer romance. It's a story of intense friendship and confusing relationships, yes. The involved parties wonder at a point if it's something more than that. They start to think it is, but does it ever become that? No. Instead a series of tragic events (including Gena's struggles with mental illness) leads us from a classic love triangle (where of course one of the two girls (Finn) was already in a straight relationship and must question everything as her friendship and bond to the other girl (Gena) grows), to an odd situation where the straight relationship gets its feet back under it and Gena is treated and even referred to as their child/kid.Gena and Finn seem to regain BFF status by the end of the story, but I just walked away feeling so confused and without resolution. Are we seeing the beginning of a polyamorous situation? That wasn't discussed in the book, but would be more satisfying than the other options I'm seeing. Is Finn just stringing both Charlie and Gena along because she doesn't want to choose between them? Did the epic potential love brewing between these two really get downgraded to a return-to-heteronormativity with a quirky, disabled bestie? Did we really just go there??A 3 star rating might seem high for a book that made me want to flip all the tables, but I want to give a fair review and acknowledge that besides the ending, this book had me rolling around in fangirl ecstasy. So while the ending might have made me give this as low as a 1-2 star rating, I gave it another star for the love I had for the first half as well as the unique and well executed narrative format."}, {"userName": "Tijana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45530304-tijana", "userReview": "3.5 stars\n  Stories change in memory and in the retelling, and you write and rewrite them until they're what you want them to be, but this is one story I want you to remember the way it happened.

It's not just something I do, it's something about the way I'm wired. It's not like this is the first time this has happened. I've always had a fandom. I've always had characters who live in my head and mess with my heart and tell me stories, and I love it.\nI don't know what's the matter with me, but everytime I pick up a contemporary hoping for something light and fluffy, it ends up dealing with some darker themes that I didn't expect. Not that I'm complaining\u2014so far, I've only had amazing reads. Gena/Finn is about two girls, Genna and Finn (duh) who meet on the internet on some sort of Livejournal-ish website where they discuss their favorite trash TV show. They become fast friends, because they understand each other in a way that no one in their real lives did, and it's all pretty intense.I honestly didn't think this book would impress me a lot. For starters, there's the format: it's told entirely through blog posts, emails, text messages and the like. It's a very fun way to write a book, and definitely entertaining all on its own, but in my experience, when the story is told entirely through this mixed-media format, either the characters or the plot (or both) ends up being underdeveloped. Luckily, though, in this book both of those aspects are explored very well, and the different format the story was told ended up being just a plus on the creative side, and not something that interfered with it in any negative way.Both the authors deserve a round of applause, because Gena and Finn were well-rounded and developed characters, and that's something very hard to do in a book told this way! I loved them, and I honestly can't pick a favorite. They were both extremely realistic. The plot also surprised me a lot. I thought I had it figured out before I even started reading\u2014girls meet, girls fall in love, drama ensues, girls are happy together/bitter and separated at the end. And it's kind of like that, yes, but it's also definitely not. I know I'm being a little confusing, but believe me, it's better if you go into this not knowing a single thing about what happens.The way this book deals with mental illness, especially depression, was SO beautiful. And I loved even the side characters, although I still don't understand what the heck was wrong with Gena's parents for them to act like they did. But apart from that (slightly unrealistic) thing, the rest of them were just as believable as the main girls, especially Charlie, who's probably one of the most adorable males I've ever read about in comtemporary YA.I literally only docked a star because, throughout the book, we see the drawings Finn makes, and the fanfics and the poetry Gena writes. And while I loved the fanfics and the fanart, I thought Gena's poetry was really bad. I usually don't comment or review poetry when I read it because I think it's very subjective and that I'm not really qualified to analyze it, but hers were just bad, I'm sorry. I wanted to skim most of them but then I couldn't, because they were directly connected to her character development and I'd miss out on a lot by not reading them (I guess that's the downside of this kind of format).This is a really quick read, I finished it in one sitting in under two hours, and yet it still manages to deliver a deep plot and characters development, and it's really, really good.

The more I think about it the more I feel pretty misled by the marketing and even the title and the summary of this book. Maybe I'm just weird, but generally I don't expect a HOT PINK book to contain themes of death and heavy trauma. I think it upsets me more because the book is about fandom, and clearly understands fandom well. The summary is in the form of a fanfic header. But any reasonable fanfic writer would have tagged this story with warnings for: secondary character death, serious trauma and grief, PTSD, and extensive depictions of mental illness. The authors clearly love and understand fandom. The first half or so of the book is fantastic and made me feel like I was reading about people I knew. I loved the development of Gena and Finn's relationship. But then things kinda of ... veer off course. First we find out Gena was a child star who acted with one of the main actors of the show they both fangirl for. That's ... weird. And the explanation for how she ended up in the fandom anyway is not that believable to me. I could have rolled with that though. Unrealistic yet awesome coincidences are a fanfic staple, so that would be okay. But then. We get to the point where Zack is killed and Gena is hospitalized. This is where the story kind of went off the rails for me. First of all, horrible death and trauma just straight up were not what I was expecting from this book and that felt like a bit of a bait and switch. See above, hot pink book, etc. Gena then spends the rest of the book essentially non-functional due to understandable PTSD. And I just don't think that did any favors for the narrative. Like, listen, I am ALL ABOUT realistic depictions of mental illness and trauma, but this particular trauma felt out of place in this story. Just as we get to what I felt was a turning point in Gena and Finn's relationship that relationship is thrown completely out of whack by what happened. I think if the authors were going to deal with this level of trauma, the book should have been like 50% longer. There was not enough time to really go through a trauma and recovery arc that would resolve Gena and Finn's relationship in any meaningful way. And then there's the title. Look, we all know the slash denotes a romantic and/or sexual relationship. These authors for sure know fandom well enough to know that. The title literally expresses that there will be a romantic relationship between these two characters. But there isn't. Not really. There's a lot of confusion about what their relationship actually is, but it never resolves into anything. And by the end, Finn is happy with her boyfriend again. And their ... 18 year old \"child\" that she might also be in love with? There were also kind of a hint of heading towards a poly thing, but that wasn't followed up either. I honestly just don't understand what their relationship was supposed to be by the end of the book. Why are Finn and Charlie paying Gena's medical expenses etc? Gena has family who have offered financial support and apparently had enough money from her child acting gig to put herself through expensive boarding school. I don't know. I just found the whole thing baffling. I don't know what I was supposed to think by the end of this book, but I basically felt confused and disappointed.

I would say, even though this is sort of spoilers territory: don't get your hopes up too much about the romance. I know, I know, you see it's tagged glbt, you see the title is Gena/Finn AND you see Finn is short for Stephanie and you're a fangirl and you know what that slash means, but...don't expect the happy ending you're thinking of. I can't believe I'm saying this, but: read the book anyway. If you liked Fangirl, if you liked The Fangirl's Guide to the Galaxy, if you liked Secret Loves of Geek Girls, you will like this. It's not perfect (epistolary novels, even modern mixed-media ones, always suffer from some awkwardness when the characters actually meet in real life, and the switch to journaling and poetry was mostly well-done and emotional but still felt a little stilted), and I'll admit I wanted the romance to go a slightly different way. But there is so much there that felt true, about fandom and mental illness and friendship and starting college/starting the real world, that I think it's definitely more good than bad. (Also I cried a lot. I know, surprise surprise). I got an ARC from Netgalley and/but will 100% be picking up the real thing when it comes out. Mostly because the photographs of characters and the fanart was still all marked TK when I got my e-copy and I NEED to see them. Edited to add: don't worry guys I got your back, I used my \"in\" with the publisher (lol that's a joke idk if they even read these things) to send this note in the \"Add a note to the publisher\" section on Netgalley: \"My only note is...I'm not sure about listing this in stuff as LGBTQIA. I mean, it's hard to say, because I'm a fangirl AND a lesbian so I probably would have read it either way. I see why you might think you'd get to a bigger audience this way. Which might be true! But it does seem a tiny bit unfair to the LGBT YA audience to advertise this as such when it really isn't, and I can see people getting upset if they feel like there was false advertising. There are still plenty of fangirls who will read this even if it's not listed in lists of queer books, so you don't have to worry about that! This will definitely pull in the Rainbow Rowell, Sam Maggs, etc. crowd.\""}, {"userName": "Shannon (It Starts At Midnight)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8652150-shannon-it-starts-at-midnight", "userReview": "You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight 3.5*My fangirl heart could not get enough of this book. I was so invested, because I could relate to so many of the things that Gena and Finn talked about and went through. Fandoms, balancing real life with an internet-based hobby that takes up tons of time, befriending other fabulous people who love the same stuff you do- it was not only fun to read about, it was a scarily accurate portrayal! I feel like it's some combination of my actual blogging life mixed with all the Tumblr blogs for The 100. And those are my favorite things! So I liked Gena and Finn as characters quite a bit. The whole story was told via emails, texts, blog posts, even journal entries, and I loved it. Sometimes it is hard for me to connect to characters in this type of book, but not so in this case. I felt a definite connection to them both, but especially Finn. I found that I related to her on a lot of levels, and both characters really felt authentic. I also enjoyed the dynamics of Gena and Finn's relationship, both online and then when they meet in person. The story flowed well, and since I definitely enjoyed the whole online friends/convention aspect of it, I was hooked on the plot.So, what went wrong? The ending. Yeah, the thing I cannot talk about. Well, I can a little I guess, right? So I just felt like it didn't fit with the story, nor was it realistic. I felt like it basically negated the point of the book, and frankly I felt let down by it for a lot of reasons. Bottom Line: If I was reviewing the first ninety percent of this book, it would be 5 stars for awesome characters and a plot that any fanperson would appreciate. But I can't ignore the last ten percent, and the disappointment it left me with. **Copy provided for review"}, {"userName": "Stefani Sloma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7346914-stefani-sloma", "userReview": "I\u2019m just not sure what to make of this book. I have really mixed feelings. It was a quick read, so that was good.I was so invested in this book. For the first half or so. Then there\u2019s a major event, and I felt the transition from the first half to the second was really awkward and not well done in my opinion. I wanted to stay invested because I really liked these nerdy, adorable, smart characters in the beginning. The book went from being really cute to being REALLY serious and dark practically out of nowhere. I think the dark stuff was important too, but the transition was so hard and quick that it could\u2019ve given you whiplash. I also think that the book was marketed as something that it definitely wasn\u2019t. In my opinion, they made it seem like it would be this epic, adorable LGBTQIAP+ book and while it does hint at that a little bit, the overall story is very heteronormative, especially in the end. SPOILER: The authors had a real opportunity here with how they set up these characters to work with their sexuality, but nothing happens with it. It ended up just being really confusing and weird. You guys know how much I love books that are made of alternative storytelling methods, and this one has it all \u2013 blog posts, texts, emails, fan fiction, and there\u2019s not a single page that has a normal page of text. I loved that format. I also loved the fandom stuff and the fact that they become friends online and then friends IRL. The bottom line: A cute, fluffy read in the beginning all about fandom and online friends that turns into a dark, serious read very quickly.

I just\u2026 I\u2019m so confused about what to think about this book. I cannot stress enough how conflicted I\u2019m feeling at the moment. I had felt every emotion possible when reading this book - both the good and the bad ones. I think that I will just have to talk about each part of the book separately so you\u2019ll understand why I\u2019m feeling so conflicted and messy about this: Part One - 5 stars. This first section was perfection. It made me so emotional. It seriously tore my heart out because it was just so relatable! I think the plotline couldn\u2019t have been better. I don\u2019t know about you, but I adore relatable protagonists and Gena and Finn definitely fit that mold for me. I actually enjoy stories 100% more if I can imagine myself as the protagonist and engage in the story on such a personal level - and that\u2019s exactly what happened with this part. At its core, this book is about fandoms and online friendships. If you didn\u2019t know - which you wouldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t really tell people - but I have a Tumblr account that I write fanfics for. I\u2019m involved in fandoms on a daily basis. I have a online friends that mean the world to me. I get these characters\u2019 lives because it\u2019s my life too. It is also just brilliantly written - simultaneously sweet & hilarious - and the set-out is so well done It wasn\u2019t as awkward as I thought it would be, reading only through email, DMs, texts etc.Part Two - 3 stars. The story really lost its traction in the second part. I no longer knew which direction the story was trying to take. It started becoming\u2026 quirkier? We lost touched with the characters. I think some of their chats were left out of the book? Obviously, not every single one of their online interaction was included in the book, but we were left to fill in the blanks and I know longer felt that I understood the character\u2019s motivations or their relationship because of the things we missed out on. I did like the little twist we found about one of the characters, but it was kind of downhill from there...Part Three - 0.5 stars. \u2026 and then we just lost the plot. What the frack was this meant to be? To put it bluntly, it was bloody awful. The writing made me cringe. I didn\u2019t enjoy this bit in the slightest - there\u2019s seriously not one positive thing I have to say about it. The characters became shells of what they were. We had no connection to them. Their relationships became forced and awkward. I didn\u2019t care about them anymore, and I no longer found their relationship or situation believable. Replacing Gena\u2019s sections with poetry looked pretty, but they were way too abstract. I honestly had no idea what they were on about! The ending sent me into a rage. How dare we get left with a cliffhanger/weird open ending after everything we were forced to endure in this awful part! *Growls* I\u2019m not happy. ... overall? I don\u2019t know. How do I rate this book? I don\u2019t know what to think! I loved the first part so bloody much yet I hated the last part so bloody much. Do I keep it neutral? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still not sure how I\u2019ll rate this book or if I even should.

It took me a little while to get what the fandom Gena and Finn love was about, but once I got that under wraps, it was impossible to put down. I could be wrong, but I think the Jake and Tyler relationship was very loosely based on Supernatural (not that anything that happens on Up Below is the same as Supernatural...in my experience anyway, but the idea of two main male characters, who have a huge fandom that is biased toward one character more than another? Yeah, that is parallel at least.) Best thing about this book is the idea that online friendships can be and are real.... Gena doesn't have anyone except for Finn, so when things get kinda crazy, I love that these two female characters were there for each other, even when it means sacrificing, possibly things in their \"real\" life. Whether you're part of one or multiple fandoms, whether you write, read, or stay clear of fanfic, you have to give this one a try. Seriously. And, like my previous fave book by Hannah Moskowitz, (and maybe still my fave) Gone, Gone, Gone, there is a big emotional aspect to this story.

The majority of my university years were spent with people loving and worshiping fandoms. From cheesy Canadian televisions shows such as The Collector to the fantasticly aged video game series Suikoden, the majority of the friends that I have came from being a part of a fandom.This book is told in a mixed media format: chat logs, e-mails, text logs, blog posts, litter the pages this book from beginning to end. It's actually perfect given how this story is being told. Gena is a young girl who has a secret identity, while Finn is a twenty-five year old recent college grad who is trying to find where she fits into the world. She has the perfect boyfriend, but he doesn't seem as interested in her fannish life. The story of Gena/Finn hit so close to home as I was reading it. It reminded me of my university days where I would spend hours looking through message boards (we didn't have tumblr when I was growing up), I ran a successful Suikoden role-playing community over on Livejournal, and I even shared that love with my friends. We all felt as though we were sharing all our loves and passions, and that is totally reflected in both heroines, Gena and Finn. When fandom and real life begin to collide and feelings become apart of the equation, this novel loses a bit of the fannish edge in favour of pushing the larger parts of the narrative forward, while still inserting fannish aspects when possible. It's delightful, heartbreaking, emotional, and I found I could identify with both heroines a lot of the time. The only character I couldn't identify with was Charlie, seeing as my husband has been a large influence in my life when it comes to fandoms as well. However, I could totally understand and even empathize with him and his personal feelings through the novel.Fandom often gets such a tough rap and treated as something to be misunderstood. Gena/Finn remind us that fandom came bring people together in remarkable ways. There's so much love and attention to detail in this novel, and I loved the positive memories that it reminded me of as I was reading it. This story just gave me all the feels, and it's a book I plan on buying for all my fannish ladyfriends because dammit fandom friendships are rad."}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "It\u2019s not often that I feel representations of fandom in YA are realistic and honest, but Gena/Finn was almost too real at times. Each awkward conversation and emotional email were reminders of my own early days in fandom, and though my story diverges from Gena and Finn\u2019s in a few ways, the intersections are powerful. Moskowitz and Helgeson stay true to their fandom experiences and in doing so, provide an excellent mirror to what teens and young adults are encountering on the screen and in real life.
