I enjoyed and felt motivated by Jess' perspective and appreciate the research and analysis she brought to the table. She made some excellent points and covered a vast number of topics from what we expected to beyond... including mental health, education of children, and gender identification.

I say early because after I downloaded it I saw the author posting about making another round of edits to it!I have followed Jes Baker ever since she was \"just\" a blogger over on the Militant Baker. Back then I think she blogged about baking sometimes, but I soon discovered that she was discovering a different sort of voice. I continue to follow her these days more on her Instagram account, where she continues to link to amazing people and live her life fearlessly, from her ongoing \"I Wear What I Want\" series to the time she took on the guy in charge at Abercrombie & Fitch with a sexy photo shoot.Jes has become a prominent voice in the body-love movement, and she does a good job bringing her own experiences together with voices and experts from other segments of the movement in this book. I liked the occasional essays from people who have different focus and training because she allows their voices to be heard as well. Jes writes in a very casual tone but the research is solid and accounted for, which I appreciated. One of the most interesting ideas for me in this book, because I had not considered it in this way, was the thought that body shaming just might be one more way of keeping women from grabbing what should belong to them in society. She has numerous examples of encountering this behavior online, since she has chosen to live so far into the public eye. \n  \"Fat women who deliberately take up space, speak out, and achieve the happiness we all desire are the perfect trifecta of terror. They represent a terror that we can't control, and so we throw our hate at them by the handful in hopes that they quiet down, shut up, and get back in line.\nI think for most women, these voices are pretty powerful. It can be refreshing to contemplate a different, more fearless way of thinking. To take up space. To live your life, without apologies."}, {"userName": "Abby Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson", "userReview": "I wish I had this book 10 years ago and I want to hand it to anyone who is having or has had issues with body image, particularly fat girls. The essays in this book that particularly struck home for me were the essay about fat girls finding love (yes! It happens! All the time!) and about plus-size fashion. 10 years ago, I truly believed that I wasn't worthy of romantic love because of the size of my body. And my path to body acceptance began a number of years ago when I first discovered that some companies did make cute clothes for plus-sized women and that I could wear all the things if I wanted. Even for someone like myself who has already started the path towards body acceptance, there are some great points and resources in this book.

Because I wanted to challenge my opinions, to see things from a different perspective, who knows, maybe I'll change my mind about obesity. Fortunately, this did not happen. The writer is so full of herself, thinking like she's some kind of a super hero coming to save us from \"fatphobia\" and \"healthism\". Then she goes on to compare obesity to race, disability and sexual/gender identity, which is offensive to anyone who falls under these categories. You can't control those things, but you CAN control your weight. I'm not saying that your weight should be a determinant of your worth, but it is a determinant of your health. And no amount of \"self love\" will prevent your arteries from getting clogged and your pancreas from getting exhausted.

But as I kept going, I started to love it. I had it on audiobook, read by the author, and it was wonderful to have Jes in my ear telling me \"You're perfect just the way you are\" and listing all the things I deserve in life. I started getting really into it during the chapter about doctors and how you have the right to change doctors if you don't like the way they treat you. I like how insistent she is that you know what is right for yourself and her unwavering encouragement to trust yourself. I thought she tried really hard to be inclusive, and I liked that she included other writer's pieces about their own experiences being disabled, trans and non-white, instead of trying to cover every different perspective herself. She included a ton of quotes and references and covered a lot of topics.

Although shelved in the adult non-fiction at my library, I think this more appropriately belongs in our teen section. Most of the advice is advice that I probably could have used in high-school, maybe college. But as an adult, it was all old news. Some of it was more interesting like health becoming our latest beauty trend. For me, the majority of the book read like a conspiracy theory. As an adult, I have rarely experienced discrimination because of my size. On the occasion that I did, I just assumed that that particular person is terrible. Not that I am terrible. I have always had skinny boyfriends except once and that turned out to be my worst relationship! Jes is saying conquer the world, but her requirements for doing so are normal, everyday living, which I have never found hard, even when I was 275.And, finally, I think Jes is misinformed about diet and exercise. For example, when she talks about how fat people should challenge the idea that they shouldn't run or jump - that is for safety purposes! It isn't discrimination. If you run or jump with a lot of weight above your knees, you will injure yourself, and this is coming from experience as well as advice from a personal trainer. This is a good example of how overly sensitive this book can be - not everything is a challenge or discrimination. Some things have merit. Some things just are. I still gave the book three stars because I think many people could benefit from it, and there were some good ideas here. I definitely learned a couple of things, too. I just really thought a book for fat girls would speak to me, a fat girl, and it did not."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7861723-jessica", "userReview": "This should be required reading for EVERYONE.

However, the way this image has pervaded every aspect of our lives makes it difficult for many of us to fully love our bodies, to fearlessly face a world where we are constantly made to feel \u201cless than,\u201d and to accept the love from ourselves and others that we deserve. Not only that, this picture of the perfect man or woman has an impact on every aspect of our lives, and if you don\u2019t fit in it affects you socially, medically, etc. Ms. Baker\u2019s research and discussion regarding how body love can change the world is insightful. I may not have agreed with absolutely everything in this book, but that\u2019s ok. Ms. Baker challenged my viewpoint and made me look at things in a different light. What she and her contributors succeed in doing by opening up is to make you think, and their words are sure to inspire you to question the information you\u2019ve been fed all your life. Because everybody, absolutely everybody, deserves love, acceptance, compassion, and understanding. There are simply too many topics in \n  Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls\n to talk about and for me to try and summarize each would do the book a great injustice. Ms. Baker does her best to be inclusive in talking about the body love movement and her care in doing so makes the book all the better. This is truly the best book on body love I\u2019ve read yet and if you go in with an open mind, you will mostly likely find something to inspire you. Ms. Baker has an intelligent, powerful, funny voice that shines and makes \n  Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls\n a must read!FTC Disclosure: I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

I've hated my physical self for too long and I'm ready to say enough is enough. The author goes through all the issues that fat people struggle with in today's 'perfect image' obsessed society.Some seem to have gotten confused over what HAES (Health At Every Size) and body positivity means. It does not mean that every single body is automatically healthy and that people shouldn't want to be as healthy as they can be dependent upon their personal circumstances. A quote from the HAES UK webpage sums it up: \"It [HAES] recognises that people of all weights benefit from healthful behaviours and being treated with respect, and so shifts its focus from weight-control for some to health-gain for all.\" [https://healthateverysize.org.uk/] The author doesn't argue that you shouldn't want to be as healthy as you can be, that you shouldn't go to the gym or dance class if that's what makes you happy. Her point is that swapping a focus on thinness for a focus on health as THE arbiter of moral character and self-worth is no better for us. Where does this leave us if we develop chronic health issues? It means that others shouldn't judge another person's health upon what they look like: a fat person isn't automatically unhealthy and a thin person isn't automatically healthy. It's about accepting that no matter what your weight or health status is, you are still worthy of love and good things.Anyway, I took away some interesting things from this book and although I can't say I will be snapping selfies any time soon, there are some things I will work on."}, {"userName": "Janis Hill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15966787-janis-hill", "userReview": "I would like to thank Perseus Books Group, Seal Press for an ARC of this book in exchange for an open and honest review.Wow. What a book! To let you know what interested me in reading it: I\u2019m tall (6\u20192), fat (hovering in the 17 stone range) and - a scary trifecta to some \u2013 smart (not Mensa). And, on top of that all I am at peace with my inner self\u2026 while not a big fan (actually totally the most horrific enemy) of my outer, physical self. And I am sarcastic, brash and blunt and LOVE reading stuff by sarcastic, brash and blunt women!With me so far? This was the sort of book I was interested in as sceptical me didn\u2019t think anything could change my opinion of myself. It\u2019s my opinion\u2026 of MYSELF\u2026 so of course I\u2019m an expert. ;-)Okay, so I can\u2019t say this book has turned me into a total convert who LOVES herself and is proud of herself\u2026 but it has made me wake up and realise all those positive things I\u2019m always telling people about themselves, all those positives I try and seek in every situation\u2026 I\u2019ve been turning a blind eye to seeking those positive in my physical self. THAT is what this book has done.\u2018Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls\u2019 isn\u2019t about being fat. It\u2019s not about being thin. It\u2019s not even about being a girl. This book is about having the reader wake up and realise how awesome they are. I do this, I am constantly telling people they are worth it, they are important\u2026 but I only focus on what is within as I can\u2019t cope with facing my own exterior. This isn\u2019t a book about fat, thin, girls, boys, etc. It\u2019s about your exterior and how the only way others are going to accept it for what it is, is if you do so first. And I thank Ms Baker for that. For years it is something I\u2019ve struggled with and she\u2019s finally been the person to prise open that stubborn willed door to help me start to see this.This book is not encouraging you to be fat. Not asking me to give up my \u2018foodie ways\u2019 and embrace pizza and over eating and getting unhealthy. None of that is even MENTIONED. But sadly that\u2019s what a lot of people I spoke to thought when they heard the word \u2018fat\u2019. This book is trying to help remove the negatives that come with such a small word. Fat. It\u2019s not about you, food, clothes or health. It\u2019s just a word to describe a part of your body. Of ALL our bodies.Oh dear, I can feel this review becoming a bit of a soapbox moment so I will shut up before someone comes and pulls it out from under me and I fall on my arse.But before I do stop soapboxing, I will say this: I\u2019m a mum of three young kids and two are girls and the other a boy with ASD. So I am constantly reaffirming how awesome they are, how fantastic they look and how terrific it is to be different. I compliment them\u2026 but found I was unable to take compliments back when they would say things like \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful mummy\u201d. \u2018Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls\u2019 has honestly helped me with this bad situation. I might not be a total convert yet, but it\u2019s helped me stop gritting my teeth when I\u2019m complimented. There is no hidden agenda in my kids saying it \u2013 just accept it. And I\u2019m starting to now see I can, and will. Affirmation in the making maybe?Okay, so I better get back to the actual review and not just spouting about how this book has affected me. There is a lot of swearing. But Ms Baker does warn us about it at the start, so no complaints there. It did mean reading affirming parts of it out to my girls needed a bit of mental translation as I went - and that they weren\u2019t allowed to read it over my shoulder - but that\u2019s okay too. It is why I didn\u2019t give it the full 5 stars though, sorry. My girls may only be 8 and 10 but they are savvy and they are already feeling the effects of the stupid body (and mind) image stigma happening. They\u2019re tall and smart too\u2026 fat may still come if they get my genes more than their dad\u2019s. So maybe a less sweary \u2018G\u2019 rated version would be good to let girls learn these fantastic truths as they enter the soul hating teen years\u2026 not something they can read while recovering from them later. Just a thought. ;-)Other than that, this is an insightful, inspirational, funny and really, really mind altering (in a good way) book. And it is our minds we need to be altering here. Our bodies are fine the way they are, let them be. Let\u2019s get those stupid mental preconceptions ingrained in our souls, break them down and realise we are what we are, love it, live it and BE it.Would I recommend this book to others? Oh hell yes. Except maybe my Nanna\u2026 not a book for Nanna, too sweary. But yes I would recommend it to EVERYONE else! This is not just a book for we fat girls, that\u2019s just a title. We all have bodies, so we all have body image issues. And so we need more books like this to help us realise we\u2019re all in it together and maybe once we\u2019ve realised that we can start cutting each other (and ourselves) some slack.Would I buy this book for myself? Yes I would. And I would get my kids to read it, as well as Ms Bakers blog and many of the places she references in it as they\u2019re growing up so they realise that no matter what they look like \u2013 that\u2019s awesome as that\u2019s who they are. Whether than start to grow outwards when they stop growing upwards, whether they stay \u201csupermodel thin\u201d once puberty take hold (yeah, good luck keeping slender hips in this family girls) \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter. And I feel every family needs such reference guides to help us all remember how awesome we are (on the outside as well as the inside).In summary: A powerful, emotional and uplifting book with a lot of swearing in it. ;-) Seriously though, this is a good read. I know I\u2019ve said it before but I feel I need to say it again \u2013 not a book about (or just for) fat girls! This is a book for those of us who can\u2019t look ourselves in the mirror without cringing, sighing or dreaming of a better view.Best thing I got from \u2018Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls\u2019 is this: You are what you are. Go with it, embrace it, cherish it and celebrate it. If you're not happy with what you are, it might not be WHAT you are that needs changing, more HOW YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF. Accept who you are, that is not admitting defeat, that is making a stand and moving on with being YOU."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1156770-ashley", "userReview": "This book was really enlightening in a lot of ways. I had heard bits of the body love movement, but wasn't fully versed in it. I am *so* glad I picked it up, because it was great.

And the chapter on health and weight was misleading.But I'd recommend this to men and women of all body types. I got a lot of paradigm-shifting on the morality of thinness, why it bothers me so much when people assign morality to food (\"I'm being good!\" vs \"I'm being bad\" about FOOD) and how our self-worth doesn't lie in our looks. (I know that, of course, but she points out some ways in which it creeps in nonetheless!)"}, {"userName": "Mehsi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720768-mehsi", "userReview": "So this will just be a short review how I felt about the book (or at least that depends on how the words will flow out of me while I am typing). I spotted this book not that long ago at the ABC book store and couldn't resist bringing it with me (especially not for that price). I am not a big girl myself, however I was still interested in reading this book. And in the end I have to say I really connected with this book, it resonated with me. The book is not only about fat girls and their lives, but also about body issues in general. And I got my share of those body issues. Have been having them for years. And while I do try to stop worrying/fretting/going a bit crazy about stuff, I just can't stop. This book is really inspiring to me, and I think I may just take some of her advises to the heart and try them out. For one stop worrying! My body is perfect, love my body! I do say this, but I am sure it will take a bit longer for me to accept my body. I will probably try her technique that she mentioned in the book. Grab a post-it note, write positive words on them, and when you have a bad moment, read them out loud, drown out the negativity!At first it took me some time to get into the book, but then the last two days I just flew through it, soaking up all the essays, all the advises, all the things that she says. I also loved the way she talked/wrote this book. I am not sure how to explain this correctly (arghhh words), but I hope that people get what I mean. The book was also great to read to see how it is for a fat girl to go through life (from societies expectations to doctors to comments from people), then again I knew some of it already, including the comments they often get, due to my mom. My mom's thyroid isn't working right, which means that even with medicines she quickly gained weight even though she barely ate anything. :| I remember one event even when my mom wanted to sit down because she was tired and her ankles hurt and people were being rude to her. :|There are also challenges, and I definitely loved them.Then there are a few guest essays, and I loved the diversity in them. Unlike with a lot of books, I often dread guest essays, often they are a mixed bag. But with these? I just loved all off them and they offered so many new points of view. All in all, a book I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone! Fat girls, small girls, people in between. But also the male population may be interested as she also talks about them at times. Haha, and this turned review out to be a bit longer than I expected. :P Review first posted at https://twirlingbookprincess.com/"}, {"userName": "Anna (Unquenchable Reads) ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19803270-anna-unquenchable-reads", "userReview": "I finished this audiobook in one day and cried when I finished"}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23159014-mel", "userReview": "This book exceeded my expectations. I'm not going to lie, initially the title of the book put me off, well, the \"Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls\" part - maybe the 'fat girls'? Is it only for young females? Was it going to be exclusionary?? Thankfully I read it anyhow!I think this is a fabulous read for anyone that is interested in accepting their body, other peoples bodies, or just curious what the whole \"body love, fat acceptance\" thing is about. Though really I would recommend this to anyone with a body. Because it's not just fat people that suffer from self loathing and insecurity- despite what weight loss commercials might try to get you to believe.The thing that I appreciated about this book is that it has a pretty well rounded (pun intended??? ehh??? ok ok...) approach to explaining body acceptance and how it affects  DIFFERENT groups of people !!! This shouldn't be such a hard thing, but amazingly it's something that many people in fat acceptance communities miss. Too many times I've been online and found groups that are well meaning, but ultimately incredibly flawed for leaving out anyone that isn't a 20-something cisgender female, who is able bodied and fair skinned with an hourglass shape. What I really appreciated was that Jes included essay's from other people to fill in area's that she did not have direct experience with. So the book manages to cover acceptance and how it intersects with race, class, gender identity(there are actually parts that address cismen and transmasculine genderqueer persons- refreshing considering that they are usually excluded,which makes the title more bothersome to me), mental illness and body ability. Yay!! While I would have loved it if each of these topics was addressed in great detail, they really are worthy of their own books. This book felt seems like it wants to introduce the reader to these ideas, and I think it succeeded in that. I felt the exception was mental illness, I have the feeling that because the author has first hand experience with it she was able to further elaborate, going in to greater depth on the subject.I also thought it was really cool that she brought up Fat! So?: Because You Don't Have to Apologize for Your Size by Marilyn Wann, Lessons from the Fat-o-sphere: Quit Dieting and Declare a Truce with Your Body by Kate Harding and Marianne Kirby and Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight by Linda Bacon. Through the magic of the internet communities have become rather big, but believe it or not there were people that were paving the path to get here through LiveJournal and *gasp* even before the internet. These aren't all of them of course, but I would agree that these books are important reads. (I haven't yet read Hot & Heavy: Fierce Fat Girls on Life, Love & Fashion by Virgie Tovar but I will remedy that this year!)P.S. I was pleasantly surprised to find it in audiobook form (yay!) and that it is read by the author (double yay!) It would have been AMAZING if the essay writers were able to read their own pieces, but hey I can't have it ALL :)"}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12293609-kate", "userReview": "My criticism of this book is limited here to its poor workmanship.- Citations are few and far between. Most glaringly, Chapter 4 is entitled \"Fat and Health,\" wherein Baker argues that obesity is not connected to one's overall health. This is a pretty controversial statement given most medical research and one I have a very hard time swallowing. Yet Baker does not give any citations for this statement - only asks the reader to take her word for it and Google the title of an article to see what she's talking about. This is an issue throughout the parts of the book I skimmed; very few citations are given for any of the statements she makes. It is an academic's nightmare.- There is no index. A book like this, offering a general overview on a subject, should have an index so that people can easily find information about specific topics within the overarching one. - The author's voice is childish, littered with \"OMG!\" and \"Yaaaaassss gurl!\" and F-bombs that make me feel like I'm reading a Buzzfeed or Cracked article rather than an honest to goodness book. I know this book is self-help/inspirational, but other books in this genre manage to maintain a professional tone.- The book is written in a rambling, stream of consciousness style, with references to comics and other visuals, that is better suited to a blog (Baker's usual medium). I found it difficult to follow and became easily bored because Baker had trouble staying on topic and providing backup for her statements (see first bullet).Did not finish."}, {"userName": "Amanda Gray", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11479019-amanda-gray", "userReview": "I've been a fan of Jes Baker's blog, \"The Militant Baker\" for over 2 years now after stumbling upon the article, \"Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls...So I Will\" (http://www.themilitantbaker.com/2013/...) . This article really helped revolutionize my thinking when it came to my own self image and how I felt about being fat and other fat people. In this book Jes attends to many of the things she touched upon in that article and presents those ideas further to be inclusive to people of all shapes, sizes, genders, preferences and races. I feel this is a book that everyone can benefit from reading- not just fat girls (as the title implies). This book is about living your life how you want to live it, loving yourself and feeling good about yourself. This book also provides a recent history of the body positivity movement and the prominent figures whose hard work along Jes' is helping to change the world. People like Ragen Chastain, Linda Bacon, Virgie Tovar, Lindsay Averill and many others who put themselves out there to spread the word about loving yourself and the fight against size discrimination."}, {"userName": "Summer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2274107-summer", "userReview": "I thought this was going to be less of a self-help book and more autobiographical or humorous or something else I suppose. It was a bit more preachy and repetitive than I thought it was going to be. And while I do agree with the message, having it beaten over my head so many times was a little too much. I think perhaps if someone was having more of an issue with their own body positivity or was less familiar with the movement I think would get more out of this book. For me it was a pass. If you are looking for other nonfiction books about self-acceptance I would recommend Fat Girl Walking: Sex, Food, Love, and Being Comfortable in Your Skin...Every Inch of It by Brittany Gibbons and Let's Pretend This Never Happened: A Mostly True Memoir by Jenny Lawson."}, {"userName": "Chelsey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5383520-chelsey", "userReview": "This review is based on an advanced copy provided by NetGalley.This is a very important book that EVERYONE should read. Most people, especially women, have struggled with body image issues, and those who haven't, know someone who has. This book is the perfect intro to changing the way we think about ourselves and others. The reason I think this book stands out among others in its genre is its inclusiveness of race, mental illness, and disabilities. Jes Baker does an excellent job breaking down how self-image affects us, especially if we don't fit into the typical standard of beauty. She also goes beyond that and gives simple, yet effective tips on how to love our bodies and rebel against the pressure society puts on us to look or act a specific way."}], "description": "Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls is a manifesto and call to arms for people of all sizes and ages.
