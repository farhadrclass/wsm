Portions of these have been abridged and additional information has been added. All alterations were done by the author herself, in an effort to improve the content. Thus the book is split up into different sections, each having a specific theme. I liked some sections and disliked others.The first part is about her childhood and familial relationships. This part was excellent. You see how Eleanor develops from an insecure and naive girl into a strong, independent woman. Watching this transformation is inspiring. You come to understand how and why she changes. You understand how she came to marry Franklin. You also understand the family she married into. This shaped her too. Then you follow her years with Franklin. He establishes his career, becomes president and dies. How they influenced each other is covered, but historical events are skimmed over. This is not the book to pick if you want the details of Franklin\u2019s political decisions or the war years. There are huge gaps in both historical events and personal relationships. This is an autobiography and clearly Eleanor is telling us what SHE wants said. There is no mention of either her own or her husband's extramarital relationships. It is not just the relationships that are lacking but also Eleanor\u2019s support of Blacks and Jews is scarcely dealt with. I was disappointed that so very much was missing. I wanted to hear more about her efforts to coerce her husband into helping these groups. Oh, and it was strange how she spoke of her husband not as Franklin, but as \u201cmy husband\u201d!After the death of Franklin her role as a UN Delegate and Chairman of the Commission of Human Rights is meticulously covered, but here the writing sounded like a political speeches selling her views against the prevalent beliefs during the Cold War period. This section felt dated and extremely repetitive! I would mutter, \"OK, here we go again.......another speech with the same message for the fifth, sixth time!\" \"Old truths\" are proclaimed. This was the part of the book that was most thoroughly covered. She traveled all over the world speaking to political leaders. Much of this section reads as a travelogue recounting all the different places she visited. She worked as a columnist, a speaker and a radio correspondent. She never stopped working; the book follows her through her 75th year, as an activist and speaker of human rights. Her death, three years later, is not covered. The audiobook is narrated by Tavia Gilbert. This narrator has a young voice, and it worked well for the young, naive Eleanor. As her self-assurance grows it felt more and more misplaced."}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1185911-gina", "userReview": "This is a very careful, guarded autobiography, written towards the end of Eleanor's life. And it was an extraordinary life, indeed. It is a challenge for anyone to write a candid autobiography, of course; there are people in everyone's life who deserve privacy and forgiveness and respect despite their failings. But it makes for a sterile book. There is nothing salacious here; no insight at all in to the experience of being married to a serial womanizer, for example, or even acknowledgement that she was in fact married to one. The years after his polio are treated as a mild rough patch and largely glossed over. This makes the parts about her married life pretty tedious, and little more than an accounting of who came to dinner at the White House when, with a big chunk detailing her visit with the Queen of England. Even her political activities during this time are fairly opaque, and she often refers to incidents with the assumption that everyone will know what she is talking about, which might have been more true at the books publication fifty years ago. It is clear, however, that FDR was an absolute genius in so many ways, with insatiable curiosity, a prodigious memory, a gift for listening to various points of view, and an unsurpassed sense for political power. Eleanor was obviously gifted in her own right, but there is no question she gained much through the opportunity to closely observe and be tutored by him. The most interesting parts of the book to me were towards the end when she recounts her visits to the Soviet Union and shares her thoughts about the threats communism posed. It is fascinating to read someone's impressions, the visceral fear, at a point in time from the near-ish future, when you know at least how part of the story plays out. She explains that the people in communist countries are then not free, but they are fed, and that forty years previous they were not free but unfed. She implores the western world to not underestimate the power of the freedom to eat. It is also a bit sad to see her genuine hope in the UN to make things better, which seems to not have really worked out either, at least to the degree she imagined."}, {"userName": "Rachielle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8241709-rachielle", "userReview": "Eleanor lived through very interesting phases of the country's history - World War I, World War II, the suffrage movement, and the Cold War to name a few. She played a significant part of her husband's presidency, being FDR's eyes, ears and legs, so to speak.I read this book because it was used heavily as a source in Noelle Hancock's \"A Year with Eleanor.\" Hancock was an entertainment blogger who got laid off. One day, she read a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt, \"Do one thing every day that scares you.\" She took a year off to deal with her third-life crisis, and Eleanor's inspiration guided her through her \"Year of Fear.\" Eleanor continues to be on my list of strong women whom I admire.

I first read it in 1960 just after I attended a lecture by Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962). Over the years I have read everything I could get my hands on about Eleanor. I was reviewing some notes the other day and decided it was about time I reread \u201cAutobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt\u201d by Eleanor Roosevelt.The book is well written but it must be taken in the age it was written, by a woman of the 19th century. The book is written in the reserve style of that era. Eleanor reviews her early life in the large Roosevelt family. She goes into details about her life as first lady and at the end of her life her hopes for the United Nations. (Last section was added to new edition issued just before her death) I could see how Eleanor rose to the challenge of first lady and the need for her to be the eyes and ears for her invalid husband, the president. Many former first ladies were overwhelmed with the role but it brought out the best in Eleanor. Mrs. Roosevelt was a complex woman and to begin to understand her it is necessary to read a wide range books about her from all points of view. For anyone wanting to learn about Eleanor Roosevelt or about first ladies, this is a must-read book.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is eighteen and a half hours. Tavia Gilbert does an excellent job narrating the book. Gilbert is an actress, voice-over artist and audiobook narrator. Gilbert won the Audie Award for the Best Female Narrator for 2017."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245041-andrea", "userReview": "I got into reading about past Presidents around the time of the inauguration and became very curious about Eleanor Roosevelt when reading about her husband. After reading this three-volume autobiography, I am no longer curious, but I have even more admiration. If you're very curious about her childhood, then by all means read the first volume, but if not, read the wikipedia article for a summary and skip to the good stuff. The second volume covers her years in the White House and contains many observations about the world and the US at the time. She definitely transforms from a woman unsure of herself at the beginning of her family life to an insightful commentator on world events. Roosevelt spends more time in the third volume detailing her own worldview as a member of the UN delegation and Civil Rights committee. The topics on which she spends the most time are colored heavily by the mounting Communist threat at the time she wrote that volume (around 1961), but her convictions that all people deserve basic human rights and that we all have a responsibility to bring about a world in which possession of these rights are the bare minimum to be expected are still as prescient and important today as ever. I enjoyed getting to know Eleanor thoroughly."}, {"userName": "Marilyn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7474475-marilyn", "userReview": "Interesting read. Autobiography's always have a different flavour than historical fiction or biography's, eg books by Doris Kearns Goodwin. One of the most interesting comments she makes is right in the preface\" The reason that fiction is more interesting than any other form of literature to those of us who like to study people is that in fiction, the author can really tell the truth without hurting anyone and without humiliating him/or herself too much.......In an autobiography this is hard to do, try as you will. The more honest you are about yourself and others, however, the more valuable what you have written will be in the future as a picture of the people and their problems during the period covered in the autobiography.\" She goes on to say\" I learned something which has stood me in a good stead many times- the most important thing in any relationship is not what you get but what you give.\"She certainly gave a life of service, her travels and all those she met along her way made these words come to life for me."}, {"userName": "Feisty Harriet", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet", "userReview": "2.5 stars. I was really hoping for more....for more SOMETHING from this book. Perhaps my expectations were just too damn high? Eleanor Roosevelt has always reigned in my mind as a champion for women and for civil rights, and in reading a biography about her you definitely get that sense. However, in her own words, she skips over most of that and focuses on FDR instead. She talks about racism as \"the social issue\" or something and doesn't address it directly. She does talk about her work for the UN and the Declaration of Human Rights a bit, which I appreciated. But in almost every stage of her life she is so self deprecating and humble that without having already read a biography I wouldn't think she had much to do with anything in regards to women's suffrage, civil rights, human rights, or feminism. Social programs to help poor miners in West Virginia? Yes, she talks about those at length. And she spends a lot of time analyzing the Soviet government, which, during the Cold War was formidable, but those thoughts haven't aged very well. Ditto her opinions on the government in India as it went from a colonial protectorate, to it's own country, and then the split between India and Pakistan. Honestly, the thing that comes through the most is that Eleanor Roosevelt is a wealthy, privileged, white woman from a well known family, her uncle AND her husband were President for crying out loud. Her life--even during the Depression, or ESPECIALLY during the Depression--was pretty comfortable. She always had money, and connections, and even her retirement \"cottage\" had 7 bedrooms and two sitting/drawing rooms. She wasn't really involved in improving the lives of the less fortunate until it was right in front of her face. Towards the end she talks at length about how she isn't really invested in social change until she is in direct contact with someone who is suffering. So, she didn't care about childhood hunger until she saw a starving child with her own eyes, THEN it became real. And that surprised me, I guess I thought she was more of a humanitarian than that? To be fair, she did possess a quality of wanting to learn everything, meet everyone, and she rarely said \"no\" to an opportunity, so for her birth/status in the social pecking order she probably experienced a lot more of the unwashed masses than most people would.I'd like to point out that a biography gives a completely different perspective of Eleanor Roosevelt, her telling her own life story in her own words, however, does not paint her as a champion of the underdog, the downtrodden, or the common man. And that really surprised me."}, {"userName": "Helen Louise", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5303332-helen-louise", "userReview": "Remarkable woman, way ahead of her time.

She is a woman of strong convictions, first puritan-like, later more liberal but the same rigid exterior. What I struggled with in this biography is I felt we never got to HER. She was always supportive of Franklin (nice wife) and it was all about his causes. A particular thing that stood out to me was the birth of her first daughter and her first son. Daughter came first. She wrote something akin to, I gave birth to a daughter and we named her Anna. Nothing more. Then for the son. I gave birth to a son and I was so happy because Franklin and his mother really wanted a son. Nothing more.I know she loved her children and took good care of them. I just wish some of that would have been in the biography to make it come alive a little. Her courtship with Franklin had not one spark of passion in her writing of it. No excitement, no anticipation, no bliss. It is as if this woman hides her heart.Mostly what this book brought to me, especially towards the middle and the end, was that it served as an apology for all the things that Eleanor and Franklin had done that the media had tried to lynch them for (as all media does -- deserved or undeserved). There were many such defensive moments here and there. The most interesting part of the book was towards the end after Franklin died where we learn of all the things Eleanor does after his death."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5482920-nikki", "userReview": "Having watched Ken Burns series about the Roosevelts I was interested in learning more about Eleanor Roosevelt. I hoped to get an understanding about their very unconventional relationship of living almost separate lives but being devoted to one another, while cementing their place in history during his political career. I can't say that I have any better understanding of her devotion to Franklin to the extent that she appeared to form fond relationships with one or two of the other women in Franklin's life. But, reading Eleanor's words describing how she fit into the world she was born into, especially her life as a child, helped me understand her loyalty to those she cared for and her desire to be an agent for change for women in her time. The writing isn't compelling, but put into context I believe that this book deserves 4 stars. It delivers on giving the reader an understanding of what Eleanor overcame living in a world in which she was the first to say that her looks and artistic and athletic abilities were lacking to the standards of the day."}, {"userName": "Kim Lee", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36259553-kim-lee", "userReview": "Interesting but very much \"of its time\".

It was wonderful to both learn about her and view the world through her eyes. She lived to be almost eighty and her life was never dull. One can only aspire to be a fraction as active as she. A biography of Eleanor Roosevelt is fascinating because you really get sense of how she developed as a person. It was a slow process for her and she didn't become the independent person we think of until well into her middle age. I particularly enjoyed the later part of the book where I learned about her work with the UN and the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She also shares more of her personal thoughts and ideas at the end. (These comments were sadly missing from earlier parts of the book that covered the Depression, WWII and FDR's presidency.) I also liked her accounts of visiting many newly independent nations in Africa and Asia. Many of Eleanor's thoughts about world affairs are still applicable today (despite being post-Cold-War). I was impressed with how humble yet fearless Eleanor Roosevelt was. She was a true inspiration.By the way, I would give 4.5 stars out of 5 and have decided to round up. There were a few times I wished that ER had revealed her inner monologue more and not been quite so diplomatic but you can understand why she did/did not write what she did."}, {"userName": "Aida", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10960786-aida", "userReview": "This book has excerpts and a synopses from Ms. Roosevelt's earlier work; This is My Story, and continues where said book left off; through Mr. Roosevelt's presidency, their years in the White House, her role as his eyes and ears when he couldn't travel due to illness, her leadership in the development of the United Nations Dclaration of Human Rights Bill, up through her personal and political life in the early 1960's. While one gains insight into the development of Ms. Roosevelt's beliefs and persona in the first half of the book, the reader gains much more knowledge into her ideas towards politics, foreign affairs, human rights and the activist she later becomes. She was a true leader and developer of of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, creating change locally in the USA, as well as world wide. She became a skilled negotiator and mediator and activist for women rights and civil rights. I found the second half of the book much more fascinating, particularly when she is on her own, after the death of her husband. She kept herself close to her convictions and didn't hide away in her cottage. Rather she effected true change for the benefit of all by being involved in the UN and her political groups.

Given how widely quoted she is and the esteem she seems to be held in, I had assumed before reading this book that she had led a charmed life sheltered from the trials and tribulations faced by us mere mortals. Finding out that this was not the case was a pleasant surprise which made her all the more human and easy to relate to. There were some things I would have liked her to talk more about, and I found myself googling certain events or people that she mentions only in passing (or not at all, but I had read elsewhere) to fill in the blanks. On the one hand, I can respect that when writing one's autobiography it is up to the author to decide what they feel comfortable disclosing for their own and other people's sake. On the other hand, I cannot help but think that it is somewhat underhanded to omit certain facts which leave holes in the narrative and short change readers - surely if you have committed to writing an autobiography, some element of bravery is required?

So far her book has not disappointed me. Also very surprised that she was orphaned at 10 yrs old and raised by her very strict Grandmother.

I thoroughly enjoyed the opening section of the book where she tells about her childhood. She is guarded throughout the book, but this part of the book felt the most open. Her childhood was challenging, and she really managed to overcome so many difficulties that she was initially faced with. She provides very little detail about her courtship with Franklin. There isn't much romance to be found here, and she never mentions Franklin's infidelities, or her own. She is fairly upfront about her own weaknesses, and admits several times where she felt she made mistakes.FDR's presidency years go by quickly, so if you want greater detail about administrative details those would best be found in other books. Although she doesn't discuss her husband's affair, I think you can feel the distance between them in the pages in this book.I really liked how Eleanor began to redefine herself during, and especially after, her husband's presidency. It was inspiring to read about how she became interested in causes and how she became an advocate for many. She assumes a lot in the ending chapters of the book. I didn't know much about her later life, so it was hard for me to put into context some of what she just assumes the reader would know about.I think what was missing for me in this book was the personal details. It just felt too aloof. But there can be no doubt that she was a great political mind in her own right.I thought this particular passage is particularly important to remember in today's political climate:\"I thought and still think that a good business executive does not make a good government administrator, nor does an administration of businessmen make for good government. A businessman needs certain qualities for success; a government offical needs a wide variety of qualities and some quite different ones. He cannot be successful unless he has a knowledge of people and politics... Often businessmen go into goverment with the idea that they will be the men at the top and that their orders will be carried out. This is probably the correct approach in business, but in government it is necessary to persuade others that what they want to do is the best course. Unless Congress goes along with them, they can't get results. President Eisenhower evidently felt that he could establish an administration in the pattern of big business, but such an approach to the complexities of government is not necessarily either democratic or successful.\"There are a lot of good political insights like the above to think about in this book."}, {"userName": "Leanna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9226170-leanna", "userReview": "There were parts of this book that I absolutely loved, and other parts that left me a little bored. That's the best explanation I can give for only giving this three stars. That said, I'm glad I read this, and it definitely offers a greater insight into the life of a fascinating woman.This book consists of four parts, each of which was originally published on its own. The first part covers Eleanor's early years, from her childhood through her early marriage to Franklin. The second part mostly covers her experiences as the wife of a politician, up until Franklin's death. The third part discusses her activities after Franklin's death. The fourth part is kind of a look to the future, updating on the state of things at the time and where she hoped the country would go.A major theme of Roosevelt's writing is her path of self-discovery. She writes in depth about how she was constantly trying to please people when she was younger, and as a result didn't develop much in the way of personal interests or opinions until she was much older. As such, the first few sections of this book largely focus on her reactions to things rather than offering any personal insights into her thoughts or opinions. She manages to make being a favored niece of Teddy Roosevelt sound perfectly ordinary, and sometimes glosses over subjects that I wanted to know more about (her relationship with Teddy, for example) and focuses instead on descriptions of houses or, sometimes, clothes.But after pushing through that, I really enjoyed the later sections of this book. That's where Roosevelt really starts to get into her own thoughts and opinions, and her life as a diplomat is fascinating. It reads almost like a travelogue as she covers her visits to foreign dignitaries and opinions about the progression of the Cold War. It's more political, but offered a lot of insight into her own thoughts.What this book doesn't cover is any impropriety on the part of anyone in her family. Her father's alcoholism is mentioned, but only casually. Nothing is said of Franklin's affairs of course, and even his illness is somewhat glossed over. If you're looking more for juicy details, Ken Burns' documentary on the Roosevelts or a biography written after her death will offer more insight."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie", "userReview": "My mother was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen.\nEleanor Roosevelt started out life as an orphan under the care of her strict grandmother. Awkward and painfully shy, her upper class upbringing was oftentimes lonely. She married her cousin Franklin before she was 20, had 5 children, and could have gone down in history as just another quiet politician's wife, but through helping FDR with his campaigns she was exposed to people from many different walks of life. She found her calling in trying to help those less fortunate both in America and around the world. In her autobiography, she tells the story of her extraordinary life.I picked this book up after Loving Eleanor renewed my interest in Eleanor Roosevelt. I knew a bit about her life before, but this book definitely filled in some of the gaps. It is an autobiography, so there are quite a few things that Roosevelt chooses not to address, such as FDR's affairs or her own extramarital relationships (particularly with Lorena Hickok), but it is understandable that she would still want to keep things private. The book is written in a very conversational tone which I appreciated, but there were definitely times where it got a bit repetitive. Roosevelt had quite the astute outlook on how the political situation as she saw it in the early 1960s would affect the future. There were quite a few statements, especially regarding the situation in the Middle East, that have definitely come to fruition. I appreciated learning more about Roosevelt's life after FDR's death as very few books I have read about her devote more than a sentence or two to her work with the UN. I would highly recommend this book to people wanting to learn more about Eleanor Roosevelt, or people who like political history or feminist history. It is a great look into a fascinating woman's life.2016 Popsugar challenge: An autobiography"}, {"userName": "Katy Zhang", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27752415-katy-zhang", "userReview": "It was clear when reading this book (or in my case listening to the audio book of Eleanor Roosevelt's Autobiography), she spent most of her time explaining in extraneous detail of things that I thought didn't matter as much to my time. My impression of her, from the story, was that she found this autobiography as a channel to voice her opinions and to defend her positions from oppositions or rumors or what have you that she noted in her time. She poured it all out in this book and I thought that definitely showed her position. But also because of this, it made me question just how objective she was in reflecting her life and those around her.I enjoyed her telling of her childhood and her telling of her years on her own after FDR's death. I thought she spent too much time dealing with smaller issues that probably mattered or were perhaps of interest to her generation, but weren't so much to many generations after. I found after reading this autobiography, longing for something more. Perhaps a documentary or a biography of she and FDR. Personally, I read this book 1. to learn more about Eleanor Roosevelt and her accomplishments, and 2 to understand the historical events from the point of views of the leading politicians at the time. And being let down while knowing that this book was not written with my desires in mind. Although I enjoyed Eleanor's writing style, and her way in telling her story, it's time for me to read something more hopefully more objective, perhaps Goodwin's No Ordinary Time and see if I could find out more.Lastly, if I could, I would abridge this audio to 1/3 of what it was, and I think it would be just as effective in letting 21th century viewers to understand her life and values. But of course, those are just my own 2 cents."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3812074-elizabeth", "userReview": "wonderful!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/728551-erin", "userReview": "I was shocked to meet the Eleanor in the first part of this book who was dutiful, obedient, and a woman who never gave any thought to whether she supported women's suffrage. In her words, \"the ability to think for myself did not develop until I was well on in life and therefore no real personality developed in my early youth.\" How depressing...but it gives some hope to those of us about to hit that age at which Eleanor's life really started to get fired up. The early part of the book also offers an intriguing view of the odd family dynamic and parental practices of the well-connected, wealthy in the early 1900's (have you ever really stopped to ponder the profession of a wet nurse?). I love how this book provides a cross section of world history - complete with Eleanor's interactions with world leaders (FDR, Churchill, Khrushchev, Tito, Truman, Kennedy), her insight into the inner-workings of US politics, and her role as representative to the UN. She travels the world and offers first-hand depictions of nations raw from breaking free from colonialism or weary from war, and she makes the reader understand why the threat of Communism felt so real. Throughout the story of her life she offers what it means to be a good leader, what it means to be an American, and what it means to be a good person. \"Do not stop thinking of life as an adventure. You have no security unless you can live bravely, excitingly, imaginatively; unless you can choose a challenge instead of a competence.\" - ER"}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29419958-jordan", "userReview": "I was drawn to this book after reading that Eleanor Roosevelt had been an outspoken proponent of racial equality while her husband was in office, when her position would have been politically controversial. I wanted to learn more about her political activism and her views on human rights more generally. One surprising conclusion I drew from her autobiography was that for most of her life she didn\u2019t see herself as much of an activist at all - she gives an impression more of someone who has a deep personal compassion for other humans but who merely expresses her views frankly when asked, rather than of someone trying to change the world (however, she did have regular newspaper columns, frequent speeches, and later in life was heavily involved in the UN).I have read a couple reviews that found the book boring and can understand this criticism though I didn't feel bored myself. For as many important people as she encountered in life she spends much of her time talking about the logistics of preparing for guests. I found the book calming and cathartic in an almost old-fashioned way. I really enjoyed reading it.I don't think this book would be well suited for someone who wants to learn the major historical events she was present for - these events seemed more like familiar landmarks than the focus of the story. I would read it for:* the way it captures the feeling of a culture and moment in time* a story about how one person matured and grew as a human being* a reminder of the compassion we should strive to show others"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237742-sharon", "userReview": "I've always admired Eleanor Roosevelt and after finishing this book, I think I idolize her. Her legacy with the United Nations and her tireless work for human rights and dignity are as strong as her husband's legacy with the New Deal. She decried America's apathy toward democracy and worried that if we didn't foster and cultivate it, we couldn't protect it either. What a great president she would have made. She was committed to her role as public servant and worried that democracy had been overtaken in the 1960 election when the candidate was selected by the Convention and not the constituents, saying \"yet boss rule can exist only where there is widespread indifference....and having committed to the machine, the delegate can only carry out instructions. He remains deaf to the voice of his constituents.\" She also decried political conventions because a party with \"noise, bands and balloons, to the accompaniment of the manufactured and synthetic excitement of parades, is to strip one of the most important features of our system of its dignity and meaning.\" I highlighted heavily and could go on, but I won't.Her active role within the United Nations gave her a global perspective on politics and peoples worldwide and she wrote a daily newspaper column on these topics, beginning in 1935 until the early 1960s. Though she wrote her autobiography 50 years ago, her words are as timely today as they were then. This should be required reading for all Americans who need to turn off \"reality TV\" and live in the real world."}], "description": "A candid and insightful look at an era and a life through the eyes of one of the most remarkable Americans of the twentieth century, First Lady and humanitarian Eleanor Roosevelt.The daughter of one of New York\u2019s most influential families, niece of Theodore Roosevelt, and wife of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt witnessed some of the most remarkable decades in modern history, as America transitioned from the Gilded Age, the Progressive Era, and the Depression to World War II and the Cold War.A champion of the downtrodden, Eleanor drew on her experience and used her role as First Lady to help those in need. Intimately involved in her husband\u2019s political life, from the governorship of New York to the White House, Eleanor would eventually become a powerful force of her own, heading women\u2019s organizations and youth movements, and battling for consumer rights, civil rights, and improved housing. In the years after FDR\u2019s death, this inspiring, controversial, and outspoken leader would become a U.N. Delegate, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, a newspaper columnist, Democratic party activist, world-traveler, and diplomat devoted to the ideas of liberty and human rights.This single volume biography brings her into focus through her own words, illuminating the vanished world she grew up, her life with her political husband, and the post-war years when she worked to broaden cooperation and understanding at home and abroad.The Autobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt includes 16 pages of black-and-white photos.", "title": "The Autobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1425825616l/22561514.jpg", "reviews": 221, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44566.Eleanor_Roosevelt", "name": "Eleanor Roosevelt"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "History", "Autobiography", "Biography Memoir"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78509.You_Learn_by_Living", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86015.My_Day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/947642.This_I_Remember", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/723667.Tomorrow_Is_Now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5301304-this-is-my-story"]}
