She has mastered the \"down-home\" dialog that is needed for this series. This is #2 in the series and takes place 8 years after the first book (or audio) ended. You don't expect someone from the back hills of Virginia - where Big Stone Gap is supposedly located - to be a descendant of an Italian family. However Ava Maria has her extended family living in Italy. This book of the series takes Ava Maria and her daughter Etta across the pond for a month to visit. Her husband Jack was supposed to go also, but family discord kept him for going. After eight years of marriage, the birth of their daughter, the death of their son Joe, and the loss of Jacks mining job, Jack does not believe that Ava Maria is still in love with him. Ava meets Pete in Italy. Is she still in love with Jack? How important is her marriage? Does she want to save it? Other than loving the authors voice as she narrates this book, I believe that I enjoyed book #1 in the series a bit better than book #2. On to book (audio) #3 in the series to see where this will be going."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1845711-laura", "userReview": "For all the enjoyment I got out of the first book in the series, I was looking forward to this second installment. Wow, talk about taking the series in a very different direction. I would describe the first book as \"light, quirky, fun, silly, and relate-able in a goofy way.\" I would describe this book as \"sad, depressing, and filled with heartache.\"My main problem with this book is the base assumption of the author. Namely:1) All unhappy men will cheat if given the chance2) All marital problems are because the wife isn't doing right by her man. It is her duty to keep her husband happy. If he isn't happy, she is failing him and the marriage.3) With 1 & 2 being true, when a man cheats, it is his wifes fault. If she was a better wife, he wouldn't have done it.Several characters in the story are involved in a cheating plot line and all of them have the same moral (see 1, 2 and 3 above). The first half of the book describes the slow process of a marriage decading. It was totally depressing and tedious. The second half picks up a bit, mostly because the two main characters (Jack and Ave) are apart so the reader can't be slowly killed by hearing how things are not working for them. There is a happy ending for them (which is why it got a 2 stars instead of a 1 star), but the ending was only happy because Ave pretty much realized that ALL their problems were completely her fault and she would be better. Some women may feel empowered by the story because of the concept that marital happiness is completely controlled by the wife alone, but I was pretty offended by that. I am pretty sure my husband can make his own choices beyond simply reacting to mine. Overall a total disappointment. Finished the book mostly out of respect for the first. I checked out book 3 in the series at the same time as book 2, but I am not sure if I will give it a chance. The reviews on Goodreads seem to indicate that book 3 is back to how book 1 was, so that gives me hope."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1824225-michelle", "userReview": "This book is sexist. They have troubles in their marriage, the woman blames everything on herself and tries everything she can to fix it, even when it appears her husband might be looking at other women. And yet, he still says everything she is doing isn't enough and she needs to do better. And her job advancement makes him mad, but he can start a company and it is fine and dandy. Worst of all, the author buys into all this crap instead of using the story to vindicate all the women who are carrying the full weight of making a marriage work, making a home, a career, and being a perfect wife, mother, friend, and community member. This book pissed me off- it was like you fall in love, you get married, then you become a slave to your husband and children, never have time to think about yourself again, and nothing you do is good enough. Also, the writer doesn't even do a good job of showing the main character doing all the things that she is later accused of doing."}, {"userName": "Marisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/986041-marisa", "userReview": "The pros of this book:I love her storytelling ability and I also couldn't put this book down. I wish that I could live in Italy and loved the descriptions of this area. I love the sense of community in Big Gap and love all the quirky characters.The cons:I really had a hard time with how Ave was the only one who seemed to take any responsibility for the issues in their marriage. I hated that she knew her husband was straying and chose to stay quiet about it. I hated that she thought that even his affair was her fault and never even made him explain himself once she gets back from Italy and even still thinks it was all her fault and that she can fix everything for a marriage where it takes two people. I really had a hard time with the second half of the book for this reason. She just bugged me and so did Jack Mac at this point. I would've liked to see them work through their issues together instead of her taking all the fault and blame."}, {"userName": "Raya", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1812864-raya", "userReview": "Sequel to Big Stone Gap, the second in this series focuses more on the relationship between Jack and Ave Maria eight years into their marriage. There was a slight departure from the light-heartedness of the first novel, the fluffiness replaced with a seriousness that made this novel more affecting. The writing is much improved and the characters still quirky and charming. It was painful and slightly distressing at times, but there was something beautiful and tender in Ave\u2019s grief, which is why I thought this was a better novel than the first. With that said, I had a few issues.I was turned off by Ave Maria\u2019s self-flagellating. Sure, this is told from her perspective, and I understand that her character makes it only natural that she blame herself for the state of her marriage. Her voice would lose some of its authenticity without it. What kills me is that this idea seems to be validated over and over. Ave can\u2019t get over her son\u2019s death. Ave is too independent. Ave is cold and detached. And the list goes on\u2026and on and on. Is she completely blameless? Absolutely not, but it seems as though Jack\u2019s misgivings and his part in the slow demise of their marriage is attributed to Ave, and that is what I have a huge problem with. Still, it was a great novel and I look forwarding to reading the next in this series."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1430050-joanne", "userReview": "A deeper book than its predecessor in some ways. Ave Maria and Jack have been married for eight years and have lost a child, and it's taken a toll on their marriage. What got me were several moments where Ave Maria comes to some painful realizations about herself and Jack. Trigiani can have you laughing out loud one moment and reaching for the tissues the next. Wonderful."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I loved this one. I could relate to the MC in more ways than I'd like to admit. I think the author spoke my language through the MC. I also enjoyed the humor; it had such charm. BUT....the one thing I loved the most was her descriptive strokes. She has a way with words that elevated characters, setting, and relationships. I loved that and really, sometimes that is all it takes to get 5 stars from my stingy fingers. This book is chick lit and the second installment to a series. I haven't read the first book in this series, but I have read the third one and gave that one 4 stars. The author narrating her own book bugged with the that one, but it didn't even cross my mind once with this one. I think I was just in the mood for this today. So, 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Cheryl, The Book Contessa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7321960-cheryl-the-book-contessa", "userReview": "What a great follow up to Big Stone Gap. These are my favorite kind of books, where I am drawn right in to the characters lives--joys and struggles, mundane and exciting. I have new friends and neighbors and coworkers in this story. I have watched Pearl grow up. I wish Ava would confide in me. Theodore is one of my best friends too! I love Etta's entrance into tween years.

Not as light & funny as the 1st novel, Trigiani\u2019s writing style has matured and so have the characters in Big Stone Gap, be prepared for a lot of soul searching. The main character Ave Maria is someone I'd like to meet in real life and have a heart to heart with! All marital problems are not the wife\u2019s fault alone; Ave Maria\u2019s character clearly champions this mindset. There is no getting around it, this book is sexist.

Take Ava Marie & Jack McChesney; After 8 years of marriage, there's a strain between them that causes them to sway in different directions. Ava Marie is worried about another woman attempting to take Jack from her but soon realizes that there are things about herself that has placed a rift in her marriage with the biggest issue of not allowing Jack to be the head of household and understanding that he's a man and not super man. It's funny, inspiring and reveals life without seeming unrealistic and full of boring extra wording. The author invites you into the lives of the close knit community and how they look out for one another. Sometimes they're nosy and a little overbearing but since I didn't grow up there, it bothers me more than them so their interaction is normal to them."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688690-nikki", "userReview": "I didn't love this sequel as much as I loved Big Stone Gap and as much as I usually love Ms Trigiani's storytelling. Slight spoiler alert... The problem for me was I wanted to jump into the book and throttle Ave for tiptoeing around Jack's \"ego\". Why do women feel they have to do that?? Anyone with common sense would see she made the right decision to help support the family in a time of need. They have a child that has to come before his \"ego\". She should have told him right away, but she shouldn't need his permission. Then her best friend Theodore, who is now out of the closet, take's her husbands side and gives her a lecture. ( Is everybody blind in this book?) Next thing, Jack is carrying on with another woman, or at least putting himself in a pretty good position for a another women to stroke his \"ego\". The book ends in a nice neat bow, but I can't buy it. I know there are more books in the series, I will have to debate them. Better books to read by Ms. Trigiani are Very Valentine, Brava Valentine and Lucia Lucia."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1355365-denise", "userReview": "Although I loved Big Stone Gap, I didn't enjoy this one quite as much....although it was still very good. It still has the same witticisms and characterizations you expect from this writer (personally, I think Fleeta is a scene-stealer, as is Iva Lou!) but as some other reviewers have stated, I didn't quite care for the way Ave Maria handled her marital tension.

Nothing is sugar coated or not dealt with. The main character is far from perfect, and the author deals with that but not by making light of the situations.

I really wanted to love it because I liked Jack Mac and Ave Maria and their crazy coterie in the first book, but they were not as appealing in this one. The whole marriage problem seemed confused. Is it Ave's fault for not bending over backward for her husband? Is it Jack Mac's fault for loving her but not getting her? What? They both have attractions/affairs? with other people that seemed unbelievable in context of the characters. I felt like the book was completely sexist in its approach to the marital problems. While I do feel that marriage partners should think of each other first and both give 100% to the marriage, Ave's approach was to give Jack Mac what he wants as part of a scheme to keep him rather than really loving him and finding out what he needs. It just didn't ring very true, and then it all got resolved super quickly and the story went on. For so much angst throughout the book, it seemed like the resolution should have been a bit more profound. So I didn't love it, but am willing to stick with the characters and see if they improve.

The first half of the book was tedious to read but the second half picked up the pace. I was looking forward to reading this one because I really enjoyed the story and the characters in the first book. However, this one fell quite a big short for me. I lost some respect for Ave Maria and how she was handling the crisis in her marriage. Yes, the death of a child takes its toll, but a team (husband/wife) have to both share in the grief and recovery. Also, is there is marital strife, both are responsible and need to address the issues together. I didn't like the fact that the author had Ave Maria take all the responsibility.

Ave Maria didn't pay enough attention to her husband, because she was too busy raising their daughter, mourning the loss of their son, cleaning, cooking, and working. So, she obviously deserves to be stepped out on. It also really bothered me that it was all Ave Maria's job. Everything. And yet Jack Mac was irritated when she took the manager position at the Pharmacy without telling him. Like, no. You go girl. You've worked hard.
