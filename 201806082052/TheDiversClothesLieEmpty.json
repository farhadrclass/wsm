I liked the book a lot and found it interesting. It uses a unique point of view that might take warming up to but I think it adds a layer to the story that we don\u2019t usually get. It places the reader in the role of the protagonist. Plus it\u2019s set in Casablanca! I loved that choice. As I\u2019m editing this review 3 years after posting it, it\u2019s because I left a snarky review about a book I liked. Who knows why, I rarely leave reviews on here. The review ended up being one of the first to come up on this page. The more I thought about it, the less I liked the idea."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "\"Go back to the before, you think to yourself. You know that, in your own life, it\u2019s not something you will ever choose to do.\"3.5 stars. A book about identity, the choices we have the power to make, and the opportunities to recreate oneself, The Diver\u2019s Clothes Lie Empty is without a doubt an original story. The second-person narration is not something you come across frequently in literature, and while it was a clever tool in this instance, you may find it a bit jarring. Or, you may very well immerse yourself in the writing and enjoy the ride. While I appreciated the brilliance of the narration, I was not completely enthralled with it. Yet, I never wanted to put the book down \u2013 despite my hang-up with the voice, I was hooked and impatient to learn the true identity of the main character. We are introduced to an unnamed woman travelling alone from America to Casablanca. She seems to be escaping something or someone, but we are kept in the dark about this initially. Upon checking into her hotel in Morocco, her backpack containing her wallet and passport are stolen. A frightening prospect to be a solitary traveler in a foreign country without any identification, money, or credit cards! Yikes! I would not want to be in this woman\u2019s shoes. Perhaps she should have heeded the warning in her guidebook to Morocco which advised The first thing to do upon arriving in Casablanca is get out of Casablanca.\" How she handles this predicament happens to lead her into a series of curious, even if somewhat implausible, adventures. Now using the word \u201cadventures\u201d is a bit of a stretch for me here \u2013 because when I hear this word I sense danger and excitement. However, I never really felt either of these emotions while reading. What I did feel was a sense of intrigue and noted quite a bit of dry humor throughout. Little by little, we learn about this woman\u2019s past as the issue of identity is manipulated and explored in this novel. Now, I have to mention that I chose this book for a challenge which instructed me to read a book set in Africa or written by an African author. As I adore this setting and have never read a book taking place in Morocco previously, this one seemed to fit the bill. However, I was slightly disappointed in that I feel I did not really learn anything about Morocco \u2013 except perhaps to keep one\u2019s hand firmly gripped on one\u2019s bag at all times! This novel could have taken place anywhere. I missed out on the sights and sounds of what I expected to be a vivid and vibrant country. It does deliver in other ways, and will appeal to those that enjoy a slow reveal of a character as well as a creative look at the idea of self and the ways one can start life anew. I enjoyed this enough to want to dip into more of this author\u2019s work in the future."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This is a lovely slip of a book, the kind of novel you become utterly absorbed in and read in one sitting.We meet our heroine on a plane from Miami, Florida, to Casablanca, Morocco. She is running away from something, but we don't know what. As soon as she gets to her hotel, her bag is stolen, including her passport and wallet. The staff try to help, but she suspects they are in cahoots with the thief and/or the police.The woman starts exploring Casablanca using another name, and she gets an unexpected job as a stand-in on a movie set. Each day in Morocco brings another adventure, and another story from her background.This was my first experience with Vendela Vida's writing, but it won't be my last. She has a beautiful style, very graceful and clever, and I was sad when the book ended. I wanted to keep following this woman and her strange journey in a foreign country. Highly recommended.Favorite Quotes\"Your mind is rioting now that you know for sure your backpack is gone. You see no way out of this. You want to go home. You have just arrived in Morocco and your backpack, your identity, has been stolen ... You think you might cry. Don't cry, you tell yourself. Don't cry. And you know you won't. A strange adrenaline, a forceful calmness overtakes you. You have been in situations like these before and you feel this tranquility, the green-blue of an ocean, wash over you.\"\"The girls look at each other and for a moment you envy the communication between happy sisters, the comfort of having someone who is always with you and who knows what you're thinking. When you were young you thought your twinship could be like that; when you were older you thought your marriage might be like that. But you were twice mistaken.\""}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "A high 4 stars. I seem to be binge reading this holiday, and Vendela Vida's The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty was perfect for a binge read. It's the second book I've read by Vida in the last few days, and I'm again impressed by her talent and voice, and must say that I liked this one even more than Let the Norther Lights Erase Your Name. Told from a second person perspective, it starts in Casablanca as the main character arrives from the US. Immediately, a back pack containing her passport and credit cards is stolen. And what follows is a captivating and page turning narrative, that has the main character stumbling into situations that allow her to claim different identities. She toys with the idea of trying to reclaim her original identity, but as the story moves forward it becomes obvious that she is trying to get away from some personal nastiness back home, and the opportunity to reinvent herself turns out to be convenient and appealing. The book becomes especially playful, when the main character becomes a double for a famous unnamed American actress in a movie being shot in Casablanca. It's clever and original. And while the second person narrative may be distracting to some, it serves as a nifty tool to reveal only small bits and pieces of the main character's past as the story progresses. You should read this book in one sitting if you can. You shouldn't worry too much about understanding what's going on or how realistic the narrative is. Just go with it, and enjoy the ride."}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne", "userReview": "When you've listened to an audio book twice in eight months, reveling in it even more the second time, the cleverness of the author is apparent. You choose books based on scant information, reading no reviews ahead of time - just reading the stars. Just the stars. You risk a lot this way, but since you love being surprised by what the pages hold, it usually works. You have never read a book where the entire thing uses the second (or is it third?) person of \"you,\" but it so completely puts you inside the head of the narrator that you love it. The incredibly conversational narration makes you feel an emotional connection to this odd story that really, you didn't even see coming.Ok. Enough of my \"yous.\" I was mesmerized by this story of a woman who goes on vacation by herself to Morocco. I'm not going to even mildly spoil the tale for you, but here is the gist. Having had her wallet and passport stolen in just the first chapter, the book seems like it may be a dark comedy where the main character finds herself in one pickle after another. In a sense, that is true, but you gradually learn that the woman is a bit unbalanced in her decision-making because she is escaping some unpleasantness at home. More and more glimpses of her recent past creep into view, and her erratic nature - which was mildly improbable up front - starts to make sense.The first time through on the audio book, I found myself cranking up the volume on my speaker so I could listen in the shower. I passed out in the bed two nights in a row as the excellent narrator continued the tale. I skipped incoming phone calls so I could find out what happened next in the story. The second time through, I savored every single nuance, every teeny tiny clue or brushstroke of foreshadowing that was interesting, but not notable the first go-round.Finally, because I work as a background actor from time to time, the scenes based on how movie productions operate were extremely fun for me. The wardrobe people really do dress in bizarre ways, there is always food food food - and candy - on-set, and there are endless hours of waiting. Aside from child actors coming to set sans a guardian (although in Casablanca, who knows?), these chapters were spot-on. While the book of course leads us to explore why the main character does some of the irrational things we see, the writer does a superb job with her observational comments. She says this about a lone parent whose shrieking child is irritating everyone on an airplane: \"Her mother was almost louder in her soothing, as though to reassure everyone around her\u2014look, I\u2019m doing my best. You squint at her with judging eyes, though you know if you ever have children of your own you will do the same\u2014you will soothe too loudly. One thing you observed at your all-girls school: half of parenting is a performance for others.\"Totally adored this surprising book and will be reading more by the author. Five stars. On my Favorites shelf.EDITED TO ADD:I found it! The poem that inspired the title of this book really exists. I loved that the main character had had bad acne as a teen, but when she took up diving in school - as opposed to say, cheerleading or track or volleyball - nobody looked at her face as she competed, only her body position, and she always ended up under the water, hidden. Then and also as an adult with acne scars, this \"diver\" was never comfortable in her own skin. Shedding her identity apparently felt good, and as you read through the story it becomes apparent that she has always been hiding herself. This book is far deeper than its surface appeal. I adore it.The Diver\u2019s Clothes Lying Empty You are sitting here with us, but you are also out walking in a field at dawn.You are yourself the animal we hunt when you come with us on the hunt.You are in your body like a plant is solid in the ground, yet you are wind.You are the diver\u2019s clothes lying empty on the beach. You are the fish.In the ocean are many bright strands and many dark strands like veins that are seen when a wing is lifted up.Your hidden self is blood in those, those veins that are lute strings that make ocean music, not the sad edge of surf but the sound of no shore.-Rumi, translated by Coleman Barks"}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica", "userReview": "Is this considered a literary novel? The dustjacket flap says it's a \"mesmerizing novel of ideas\" which is probably true if you take \"idea\" to mean \"made-up shit.\"Here's my summary: This is a story about a sociopath who leaves her Jerry Springer Show life behind and embarks upon a spree of unrealistic situations in which there is no such thing as consequence.WARNING: I'm not going to bother spoiler tagging this review. It's not worth my time and effort. Please be aware there are potential spoilers from here on out. Read at your own risk.You may have heard that this is written from a second person perspective. I know that can be effective. In this case, it reads more like a Choose Your Own Adventure and less like Camus. Second person narrative is supposed to create a nearly-instant bridge of empathy between the reader and the main character, right? Maybe this particular tale was meant to sound more like a travel guide. Whatever the case, it didn't work.At first, I thought the main character was a woman because everything felt like it came from a female perspective. But then I realized I was imposing my own gender on my reading. I was actually reading about a male. I came to that conclusion when the multi-named \"You\" went down to a hotel basement in Morocco with an unknown man to look at security footage and felt totally fine and comfortable doing so. Then there were suddenly six guys in the computer room and none of them could access and use the security footage so You asks to give it a try and all the guys move aside and let You try. So, yes, obviously, this character is a man because a woman would have felt some trepidation at being alone in a basement with a strange guy in a foreign country and where on earth would six men step aside and let a woman try to do computer stuff? Nowhere.\n  But then, just a bit later, You mentions wearing a skirt and purse and while this character could be a man wearing women's clothing, I didn't think that was the case because I think a man in woman's clothing would have had as much, if not more, difficulty with this situation as a woman. So from the start, I had a problem connecting with You because she doesn't act the way I would act as a traveler in a far-away country. She made no sense to me and she didn't feel real.But it's not just the character who poses a problem, it's the premise of the story.See, You is running from something in her very recent past, something to do with a relationship break-up and also something to do with her sister. She decides to go to Morocco, solo. I've never gone to another country all by myself; there's always been someone on the other end, whether it be a friend, a travel guide, or the person who had hired me (I was a skilled hitman back in the day)(that is a preposterous lie. I taught English as a Second Language) so I understand that maybe this woman's experiences would differ from mine but I figured they couldn't be that much different, maybe just more intense, or something. Right? I didn't expect her to be a complete wet noodle of dumbassery.So she's signing into her hotel and...You take your passport from your backpack and you fill out the form, using the passport, then you go to grab your backpack in order to put your passport away and you find your backpack is gone. It's been stolen. That's why you have to go to the security office in the basement with the one guy. From there, she freaks out. Her backpack contained her new camera (not actually new but never really used and still in the box because she was going to read the instructions on the way over but never did because of reasons), her credit cards, probably her driver's license, and everything else one keeps in carry-on luggage. She tells the hotel staff that everything is gone, her identity, her money, all of it and they go over footage and find that the backpack was taken by some sneaky guy with a badge so they call up the cops to report her missing backpack and identity and credit cards and she somehow winds up getting a different backpack with someone else's identity and credit cards from the police, then freaks out over having a possibly stolen identity of a possibly dead woman. Maybe. Kind of.But back up - do you notice something?Something glaring?The glue that binds this story? (not literally. That's a different kind of glue, altogether)She hasn't lost her own passport. It is IN HER HAND when the backpack is stolen. She has her passport, she was using it to fill out all the forms at the hotel. But then her backpack is stolen, and suddenly, her identity is gone?That's what this story runs on - her identity.And yet, though it is never acknowledged, her passport is sitting there on the desk with the form where all her passport information has been written down.I guess there wouldn't have been much of a story had she just picked up her passport, went to the police, reported the theft, then checked-in at the American Embassy.And maybe this is how you do it when you're flying solo, I don't know. I just know that I wouldn't have not remembered that my passport had not been stolen. I would have noticed it there in my hand. I could have taken care of the problem, even on my own, without the kerfuffle that ensues in this book.From there, it's one ridiculous (and not in the funny sense) decision after another, switching out names, ditching identities, becoming a stand-in for a \"famous American actress\" who is never named - actually, hardly anyone is named in this story, which is somewhat infuriating - and then running off from that and embarking on a whole new lie. I did not mean to say life, I meant lie.Having this written from You's perspective was offensive. I am not a stupid traveler. I'd have made much better decisions and would have been much more aware so I don't want this character to be me.The writing is rather unfortunate, as well. Some people may find it to be prosetry to their eyes. It was torture to mine.Sentences like (in regard to the clerk working at the American Embassy) An American woman in her forties, with a Sontag-gray streak in her hair, greets you. \"How can I help you,\" she says. You find her formidable, and probably attribute more intelligence to her because of her Sontag streak, her streak of Susan Sontag.1) I got the Sontag reference the first time. I know who Susan Sontag is. Stop using her name over and over in two sentences, especially since no one else has really been named by this point.2) If you don't think the audience will understand and you know they're too lazy/uncaring/dumb to look it up, just don't use the reference at all. Overexplaining kills it.But hold on, I have another one.She's in the souk (market) looking at the spice stands and she thinks:The displays are exactly what you expected of a spice shop here, and the shop's popularity with tourists leads you to suspect the shopkeepers have studied pictures in the guidebooks to Morocco.\n  Go ahead and think about that. You might come to the conclusion that that's super deep and even kinda meta. I came to the conclusion that it was outright stupid and kinda disingenuous.The dialogue is nightmarish and beyond awkward. Here's a conversation that happens after You sees a smartly-dressed woman and a tattooed guy watching her in the eating area of the hotel's lobby. She randomly assumes they are CIA and are after her because she is in possession of a possibly-stolen passport and credit cards. She runs upstairs to her room to pack and leave but then remembers she can't go out through the front doors because the CIA are down there so she goes up to the roof where the swimming pool is kept and then realizes how weird she looks being dressed and carrying her luggage (only her backpack was stolen; she still has her suitcase full of clothing) at the pool so she goes to the dressing room, puts her one-piece swimsuit on because her body isn't what it used to be (I'm rolling my eyes so hard as I type that both because of what it probably sounds like to you and because of what it actually signifies), stashes her luggage, and starts swimming in the pool...as you do when you've fantasized two CIA agents on the lookout for you. And, oddly enough, they arrive in the pool room just as she's getting out and toweling off. The three of them, the pale woman in business attire, the tattooed guy, and You, are the only ones there.\"We saw you downstairs,\" the pale practical woman says. \"Did you see us?\"The tattooed man says, \"We were in the lobby. We noticed you across the room. Are you staying here at the hotel?\"...\"I'm sorry,\" the pale practical woman says. \"We're being so cryptic.\"\"We're making a movie,\" the tattooed man says. \"You might have seen our crew?\"...\"It's a medium-budget film with a major American movie star,\" the pale practical woman says.\"This is the quality of the terrible, stunted, awful, fake, bad dialogue. Seriously, who would ever talk like that? It's so unnatural. The pale practical woman is American, by the way, and the tattooed man has a vaguely British accent so it's not like they're speaking English as a second language. And, yes, they're always some variant of The Pale Practical Woman/Secretary and The Tattooed Man. No names. Ever.But wait! There's more!She gets randomly and not-realistically hired as a stand-in for the movie because the other stand-in was sent home due to scandalous behavior and since they're in Morocco, there are no actresses the right color and shape to stand-in for the Famous American Movie Star but our crazy lady, here, is white and about the right size so...she's hired! Turns out, she's great at crying on-screen. Also, she meets Patti Smith at a concert, which is awesome because it's nice to finally talk to someone with an actual name! But then she makes a non-mistake and things get blown out of proportion so instead of going to work one day, she hops on a tour bus and leaves town, as one does when one does not want to deal with drama on the set of a movie. She creates some confusion and, as a result, the tour guide thinks there's an extra person on the bus and this causes a problem when it's time for the tour to return to the hotel area. Apparently, there is no protocol in place for when someone on a tour goes missing because the guide flips out and makes everyone on the bus partner up and go out to the market to look for the missing person. You is put in a group with two American women in their 60's - one of whom ends up being part of the reason You ran to Morocco in the first place and that's about the most ridiculous coincidence I've ever read plus it was completely unnatural, so I hated it - and they realize that no one knows who is missing so they won't know for whom to look. After discussing that very thing, here is what one of the American 60-year-olds says before going on the missing person search:We haven't been told who to look for.\" She laughs. \"It's not a funny situation, someone being lost in that labyrinth, but it's very funny that this entire bus is about to go looking for someone without even knowing a description.\"Pro-Tip: If you have to explain the joke, it's not funny.Also, none of this happened in the first place because she had her fucking passport the entire fucking time.Oddly, the dustjacket told me that this is funny. It assured me that this story is \"Told with vibrant, lush detail and a wicked sense of humor\"It's not. None of that is true, at least not for me.Maybe you'll have better luck. Remember to hang on to your passport.And if you do wind up loving this?\n  Get off my lawn."}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "4 enthusiastic starsWow.

The thief, caught on security camera, walked serenely out of the hotel, her backpack slung over his shoulder. He wisely left her suitcase, which contained nothing of value: only the diver's clothes. The \"diver\" (the title is taken from a poem by Rumi) is our nameless protagonist, a 33-year-old American from Florida who has flung herself around the world to escape the fallout from a painful divorce. The reasons for the divorce are revealed in bits and pieces and when the puzzle is fully formed, it is more bizarre and tragic than we could have imagined. Part madcap comedy of errors, part Kafka-esque nightmare, The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty is a cool and clever psychological thriller that displays Vida's signature lonely, emotionally disjointed woman traveling abroad. The second-person narration may irritate or confound some readers; it is not a POV construct we see much outside of the short story form, for it's difficult to enter and remain engaged in an extended narrative with all those \"yous\" being thrown at us. But Vida's novel is slim and this reader found the 2nd person narration pretty brilliant. It conveys a sense of \"everywoman\", like something written as travelogue or self-help article. It feels as though our hapless heroine is talking to herself, talking herself through this disaster-adventure. The \"you\" allows the author, her character, and the reader a certain sense of freedom\u2014unburdened by the inner thought of first person, the puppet-mastery of third person, all choices are possible. And the woman, who becomes Sabine Alyse, who becomes Reeves Conway, consistently makes the bad choice. But it's hers, and hers alone to make. And after her identity is stolen, choices are really all she has left. You wouldn't expect to find the woman on a movie set as a stand-in for a famous actress a mere two days after the theft, or hanging backstage with Patti Smith , but that's where this novel leads. It leads into deeper territory: all the ways we construct and lose and rebuild our identity. It's heady stuff, this. Vida takes us into foreign lands and strands us, dizzy and disoriented and without a friend. And what a perfect metaphor for the effects of grief and loss. The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty is powerful and elegiac, absurd and compelling.

Our narrator, a fraternal twin, had become so entwined in her twin's life that now that she's on her own, she barely seems to know who she is. In the course of the book, she shifts identity several times, adopting new names and stories, but we never find out her actual name. In fact, we never find out the actual names of most of the characters with speaking parts in this book, including some who are quite crucial to the plot. Meanwhile, the important characters who are named remain mostly completely offstage, with not a single line of dialogue. The shifting identities and the doppelgangers reminded me of Paul Auster's New York Trilogy, and the narrator's numbness and hollowness reminded me of Joan Didion's Play It As It Lays, but the book has a contemporary, almost cinematic, feel all its own.I'm making this sound like heavy stuff, but in fact this book is exceedingly entertaining and readable, occasionally funny and sometimes suspenseful. I enjoyed it immensely and would have given it five stars, but some aspects of the plot strained credibility a bit too much for me. Also, the big question of the book remains unanswered, but that's not really a spoiler because this novel actually contains several big questions, and your feelings about what the big question really is could be completely different from mine. Pretty impressive for such a short book!

She flies from Florida to Casablanca with very few possessions, a few clothes and small back pack. Her guide book says \" The first thing to do on arriving in Casablanca is get out of Casablanca \"On arrival at her hotel, whilst booking in her back pack, with her passport, money, computer and camera in gets stolen.This leads to a series of 'adventures' which I can only describe as fortunate misadventures, somewhat like those in the book The 100 year old man who climbed out of a window and disappeared by Jonas Jonasson. This book is not funny like that one, although there are some amusing moments.I found this story which is written in 2nd person narrative, a device not used much apparently, and one that I can't remember ever reading before, a very 'intimate, involving' way of telling a story.There are some poignant moments when we find out the reasons why she is running away.For me Rumi is saying we are everything, in everything at all times.Anyway Vendela Vida has a new fan in me and I will absolutely read more books by her in the future."}, {"userName": "Lata", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata", "userReview": "Written competently, and the use of second person for narration was unusual, and did feel like the internal monologue of the unnamed main character.

And with good reason. The book beautifully explores the question of identity and how to disappear in clear sight and morph seamlessly from self to self when the REAL self is shattered.Vendela Vida takes a risk in narrating the entire book in second person, which could easily become wearisome. Yet it doesn\u2019t. The \u201cyou\u201d voice creates an intimacy and sense of complicity with the reader and also amplifies the theme. We never learn the narrator\u2019s name (only her false names) and so she could be anyone\u2026even you.Our unnamed narrator arrives in Casablanca, fleeing from something emotionally painful, and within the first few pages, we learn that her backpack has been stolen. The backpack included everything that spoke to who she is: her passport, her wallet, her camera. This incident triggers a chain of events that, eventually, lead her to take a stand-in role for a famous American actress. As she dons the actress\u2019 dresses and wigs, the symbolism is clear: the person who she once was is now gone. And once identity is given up, anything in life becomes possible.As our narrator moves away from the person she once was, the reader gets glimpses of the essence of who she is: spunky, more than a little paranoid, risk-taking and above all else, resourceful. Throughout, the book addresses an elemental question: what happens when we free ourselves from our name and past history and choose to become the creation of our own making? The title, by the way, is from a haunting Rumi poem, which ends, \u201cYour hidden self is blood in those, those veins that are lute strings that make ocean music, not the sad edge of surf, but the sound of no shore.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Crazy tale book! And came to me just exactly at the right time. I needed a diversion from the tome or the logical, serious, or condescending modern. Or a book for which I had to creep through dialect or immense cultural language obstacle course fixtures. Was it serious? Maybe- but at the same time it did NOT take itself seriously. Not at all.This is a tale of a 40 year old woman who goes to Morocco on vacation to divert and escape from an intolerable and finishing divorce. She's a twin. And some of the essential information about her is missing until a scant 60 or so pages of the book remain.So you focus entirely upon what is happening since she arrived in Casablanca, and almost nil about the \"at home\" situation. Which is an excellent thing. Despite the present tense/ second person narrative prose (many will be HIGHLY irritated by this), it puts you into the NOW for every chapter and occasion. In this case the NOW is dangerous, scary and intriguing enough to suffice for an excellent \"this is how it went down\" tale. Tension didn't slack at all for me- not once. Many readers will not appreciate this as much as I did, IMHO. Because having all her money, passport, credit cards etc. stolen immediately upon arriving at the Gold Tulip hotel- that would seem the beginning of too dire and contrived a tale? Regardless, I followed each and every move of the next week or two with a one sit down read. There were 6 other books in the pile and this one won. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HER NEXT! Exclamation more than a question. The poetry and song lyrics were delicious. Her story unlikely but more the real for the places where no rules of authority are efficient or probable to how they appear. The ending a bit unsatisfying too- but quite exactly like our human lives at the same time. The future is open to extremes when you risk the most. And the more you want change, the more you may concede to risk most easily. Sometimes even the most risk is a bluff jumped off of with little judgment before and without you, yourself the jumper, even noticing the descending plunge. Well, she's jumping.For those who have been majorly punctured by love ones- this is a read to \"enjoy\" decades later after the fact. Not during or just after. Vida knows all about it. Been there, done that, I'm sure."}, {"userName": "Antigone", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone", "userReview": "Vendela Vida's wisp of a novel, 213 pages all told, is conveyed entirely in the second person. There's a reason we don't encounter a lot of this in our literary travels. And that's because it is a very presumptuous road.The second person voice eschews any form of literary foreplay. No energy is spent on introductions or establishing a rapport. Instead the author breaches all boundaries at a jump, thrusting the reader, pell-mell, into her character's head. And if a writer isn't skilled at this sort of thing, if she doesn't have an extraordinary grasp of the human psyche and a sincerely deft touch, the novel is doomed. The story could be brilliant. If I'm not inhabiting a head-space I can work with? All the author's done is clapped me in a prison. The d\u00e9cor could be exquisite, the food delicious, the company engaging - it's still a prison and I'm still counting down the days left on my ride.A fairly benign example:When the plane begins to descend into Casablanca, you organize your belongings inside your backpack. You will need to get off the plane without making contact with the FSU woman in the white puffy Reeboks. The businessman next to you wakes with five rapid blinks. He smiles at you and you smile weakly in return because you are envious of the sleep he has slept. When the plane lands, it veers left, then right, and then finds its way into a straight line. Your fellow passengers roar with applause. The cockpit door is closed, so they're not clapping for the pilots. They are clapping because their existence persists, because they are not aflame on the tarmac, because they did not disintegrate over the Atlantic. The scattered applause seems too muted a celebration of living, so you choose not to clap.Welcome to Alcatraz - where passengers who \"roar with applause\" are, two sentences later, \"too muted\" in their celebration. Where, because the cockpit door is closed, no one could possibly be clapping for the proficiency of the pilots. Where, apparently, the decision not to clap is judicious and informative.You know, a whole lot of authors are currently skating on the public's fascination with unreliable narrators, and I just...well, I feel the need to note this. Vendela Vida's narrator is completely reliable. She's just a fool. And she's reliable in the way a fool is reliable, which is to say you can rely on her to be consistently foolish - in reasoning, in action, in intent. And when the author eventually gets around to attributing this foolishness to trauma? I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not you're going to let her get away with that.I'll be checking in with my parole officer."}, {"userName": "Ms.pegasus", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus", "userReview": "[ Here, one can consider if extreme change has come about through betrayal or through inattention to all the smaller hints of change.

Imagine a cross between Rachel Cusk's \n  Outline\n and The Talented Mr. Ripley; the chameleonic protagonist jumps from identity to identity, latching on to acquaintance after acquaintance, and performs increasingly elaborate deceptions, moving through scenes from a shabby hotel to a movie set to a desert tour. Suspension of disbelief is essential, as the protagonist (who remains unnamed, unless you count about six fake names...) makes some ludicrously terrible decisions - accepting someone else's possessions and passport from the police as though they are her own, lying to the American Embassy and so on. And then, of course, there's the fact that in the space of just a few days, she goes from losing everything to being the stand-in for a Hollywood star. The whole story is told in second person, so it takes longer than it perhaps should to realise that the protagonist is probably an unreliable narrator - or whatever it is you call an unreliable narrator when they are not, in fact, narrating. That constant 'you' works cleverly by implicating the reader in the protagonist's every decision, carrying the story along in gripping fashion despite the often outlandish turns taken by the plot. Summed up in a sentence, The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty is an intriguing, taut novella that's infuriating in the best possible way.

The entire novel is in the second person, so the main character is addressed as \"you.\" There is only one character in the entire novel who is called by her name (the main character's young niece), and even this name is used as an alias by the main character. All other characters are called by a title (e.g., the chief inspector, the young producer, the young American actress), often with a descriptive adjective. The novel is essentially about one trying to lose one's identity and reinvent oneself. It is also about dealing with an emotionally traumatic experience and leaving the past behind. The prose is crisp and straightforward--it reminded me at times of the character Sgt. Friday of Dragnet--\"just the facts, ma'am.\" The sentences tend to be very short, and they can be repetitive in an almost David Mamet style. And yet the book moves along. This reader got caught up in the main character's exploits on her trip to Casablanca, her having her wallet and passport stolen, and her becoming a stand-in for a spoiled young American actress in a film being shot in Casablanca. The traumatic experience from the past is revealed in snippets throughout the narrative until near the end where the secret is unleashed upon the reader.

This was one of those books. I won't go into the mind-numbingly boring storyline except to say that the plot revolves around a youngish woman traveling to Morocco. She is fleeing a bad personal situation at home, which is only hinted at until three quarters of the way through the book. The first seventy pages are devoted to a description of the main character (we never learn her real name) losing her backpack and thus all her important documents. When we finally learn what has happened to the woman back home, it is so ridiculous and unrealistic that I was enraged. It turns out that No Name agreed to be her twin sister's gestational carrier, despite the fact that she did not have her own children and was clearly not psychologically sound. No questions asked by the doctor; she apparently waltzed in and had her sister's baby. Granted, I am more sensitive to this than the average person, given that our son was born via gestational carrier, but if a major plot point in your novel revolves around this medical situation, please do your research. The infertility world is highly regulated; any doctor worth his salt requires potential gestational carriers to take a lengthy personality test, as well as undergo counseling alone and with the intended parents. By the time a baby is born, there should be no questions unanswered or potentially difficult situations not discussed. Furthermore, fertility specialists generally require you to have your own children, and preferably to have completed your own family, before you can carry for someone else. Doctors are wary of allowing a woman without her own children to be a carrier for a number of reasons, one being that there is no way of knowing if that woman is capable of healthy pregnancies if she's never been pregnant, and the other being that she would be unprepared for the emotional aspects of pregnancy. The character in this book seemed to be having some sort of psychological breakdown brought on by having her sister's baby and then having to give it away. On top of this, Vida uses incorrect medical terminology throughout this portion of the book. I feel that Vendela Vida has done a disservice to the many people who have found surrogacy to be a wonderful and beautiful way to have a family. She perpetuates the idea that gestational carriers have an emotional tie to the child they carry, when in reality, if she had done research, she would see that this is quite rare when the proper protocols are taken. I am sorry to use this review to vent; I was unable to find Vendela Vida's email address online, or else I would have just sent it directly to her. :)"}], "description": "From the acclaimed author of Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Name and The Lovers comes a taut, spellbinding literary thriller that probes the essence and malleability of identity.In Vendela Vida's taut and mesmerizing novel of ideas, a woman travels to Casablanca, Morocco, on mysterious business.
