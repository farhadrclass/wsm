I fell in love with this book as soon as I started reading it. The plot is so simple yet interesting. It\u2019s about how family is the only place where a person can really be safe and happy. In this book Ashley has beautifully depicted the importance of family and basic values in ones life.Inspite of the book covering a relatively intense subject, the book was not itself an intensive read. It was light as a feather and the intense meaning were successfully delivered with simple story-telling.I also loved the attention to small details; for instance, I was impressed by the use of three different shoes to depict each sister (right below the chapter title of each chapter.) It was really clever and cute.I want to say so much about this book but words are failing me to describe how really good this book is, so I\u2019ll just say it in one line: read it to see how good this book really is.Characters:The three sisters have such contrasting personalities that it was really interesting to read about them. They feel so real that you\u2019ll feel a connection with all three of them inspite of them being so different from each other. I love them so much that I can\u2019t even pick one as my favourite.Her Sister\u2019s Shoes is one of those rare books, in which even a character with a guest-appearance is really thought out. Right from the main characters to the big reporter and the female lawyer, every one feels like a real person. and that\u2019s the beauty of this book. You feel like you\u2019re actually reading about real people.Romance:As this was a book about relationships, there was no romance in particular, but a lot of love. Love between sisters, love between husband and wife, mother and son, cousins, old family friends and acquaintances in general.This book really made me feel happy, I don\u2019t know why, but it did!Writing:In one word, Ashley\u2019s writing is beautiful. It had a brilliant flow and the sentence building was so simple that reading this book felt like buttering a bread. There was an indescribable easiness about Ashley\u2019s story-telling that I was lost in it completely. Maybe that\u2019s what they call \u2018magical writing.\u2019Beginning:The book started off beautifully. It had the right amount of stuff that can make the readers feel that they are in for a great read. I was hooked from the beginning. The mere simplicity of the story made me turn page after page, and before I knew, I was half way through already!Ending:The ending was just perfect. The only thing I was dreading the entire time, while reading this book, was a sad ending, but Ashley had an amazing surprise at the end for everyone. It couldn\u2019t have been better than this.Blurb:Precise! It gives a really good idea about what you can expect from this book.Cover Art:I absolutely love it <3 (Don\u2019t you?)You can also read this review at \n  The Reading Bud."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17342385-giselle", "userReview": "*I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Her Sister\u2019s Shoes is a book about the Sweeney sisters named Samantha, Jackie and Faith as they battle against personal wars: family demands and career life. One has a son in a wheelchair, the other fears the truth behind her husband\u2019s infidelity while the other lacks courage to stand up to her abusive husband.The book explores very dark & serious topics like family dysfunction, abusive relationship, profound effect of parental separation, alcoholism, infidelity, disabilities and about how the family copes with early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.This book accentuates the increasing marriage breakdown that is prevalent in today\u2019s society; the detrimental effect of dissolution of parent\u2019s marriage and the \u201cinvisible victims\u201d of diseases that some are unaware of: The rest of the family.In adult life, it\u2019s not really about if you made the right or the best decision therein but more often than not what matters the most is how you deal with the ramifications of those decisions.EXTENSIVE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTEach character in this book was well though out. The author described and differentiated each character meticulously. The delicate themes and realistic issues had been successfully delivered and each character undergone extensive character development. They had distinct appearances, distinct ambitions, distinct attitudes and most importantly, each of them had a character defect making them more real. As you finish this book, you\u2019ll witness how Jackie, Sam and Faith developed as a character.Me hating Jackie\u2019s character for insisting to put their mother in a retirement home is actually a good sign which means the author successfully brought the character in a realistic manner. I was absolutely cheesed off with Jackie\u2019s character. How could you put your mother in a retirement home? She's not going to spend any more time trying to get close to you, she wasn\u2019t asking for something so big, she only wanted to stay with her family. FAITH IN HUMANITY RESTORED!Despite all the overwhelming odds faced by each character, in the story, you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s always someone lending a hand. Underneath the issues about family relationships, this book also subconsciously highlights the resurrection of humanity. In the apparent proliferation of injustices, abuse, mean-spiritedness and physical violence; there\u2019s always someone willing to help whether it\u2019s a police officer willing to guarantee your safety without expecting anything in return or your own sister willing to fight for you when you can\u2019t even fight for yourself. Hence, faith in humanity has been clearly restored in this book.THE WRITING STYLEAshley Farley\u2019s writing style was flawless and very easy to follow. Farley definitely knows what type of dialogue to enter for a particular situation. Through the full use of multiple narratives, readers can gaze upon the story in a three-dimensional manner. You can relate to each character so well, you can fully understand their frustrations, their desperation, heartaches, disapointments, their longing and their hope for something good to happen. I commend the author for making each central character distinct. Since the story was told from three POVs, as a reader, I was able to connect with each of them like putting myself in someone else\u2019s shoes as the title implies. It allows oneself to experience something from someone else\u2019s point of view. Each person lives a different life. You cannot judge the other without putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes.THE ENDINGI wasn\u2019t that fond of how the story ended, the part that I didn\u2019t like was very minimal though. The ending was like a lucky streak, it wasn\u2019t that realistic for me. I could have like it if the secret behind the key was something other than a monetary reward. They struck it rich!THE SUBJECTIVE REALITYIn psychology, Carl Rogers (a humanistic theorist), based on his PHENOMENOLOGICAL THEORY, has a term called \n  \u201cphenomenal field\u201d\n wherein he states that a person\u2019s behavior depends upon his/her \u201csubjective reality.\u201d The three characters in this book respond to their situation based on how they perceive it. Each one of them acts in accordance to how they perceive and how they interpret their own version of reality. We cannot judge them because it is how they view the situation. Observing the same situation may lead into two different outcomes. My point is that this book portrays realistic stories by producing characters that undergo same real life issues but they respond in a different way or how they \u201csubjectively\u201d interpret these adult realities or own phenomenal field. There\u2019s no standard way for how we live our lives, we only respond to our circumstances the way we understand it. Thus, nobody can tell how you suppose to live your life.THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMPATHY & SYMPATHYThis book also explores the big difference between SYMPATHY & EMPATHY. The former is an understanding of the situation of the other person while the latter goes beyond the term sympathy. Empathy is a shared feeling. Her Sister\u2019s Shoes demonstrates the true meaning of \u201cempathy.\u201d Each sibling experienced a painful personal tragedy. Both of them suffers the pain of witnessing a parent as she battles against early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They shared the pain of their sister as she suffers from the emotional pain and trauma caused by domestic violence. They shared the heartache of their sister as she suffers from the reality that her husband will never be home again. They shared the pain of their sister as she battles against self-blame for seeing her own son who might never live a normal life again; the pain of witnessing his own son as he fights against his own inner torture. They cried, they laughed and they fight while holding each other\u2019s hand.When the world turns its back on you, who do you think will pick up your broken pieces? Is it your friend? Your boyfriend? Your coworker? Your advisor? It\u2019s none other than your FAMILY. No matter how fucked up your life is, your family will certainly stand by your side. Even if you run away from them because you are so full of yourself, believing you can live on your own accord, one day, you will just find yourself going back to your home.I highly recommended this book with its own Southern charm for readers who enjoy realistic and contemporary women\u2019s fiction. Also great for fans of Elin Hildebrand and Liane Moriarty.Review also posted here: HARDWORK BOULEVARD"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "This was a really good book with lots of things going on. I felt like I needed to help Sam tackle that bar while I was reading it. Three sisters. One so married with teenage boys who finds out her husband is having an affair. Another who is unmarried and has a teenage child in a wheelchair from an ATV accident which killed his best friend. He has given up on life and moping around feeling sorry for himself with a lot of anger. And the last sister is married to an unemployed drunk who gambles all the time and thinks the whole world owes him and he owns his wife. Then there's the mother who for the most part realizes what's going on, but then she has her moments where the daughters are very unsure if she should be left alone. And, to top it off the family owns a seafood restaurant/ market that has been in the family for years and is now being restored. I really, really liked the character development and the way the author handled the story. It wasn't all sad, there were some light moments and yes, tears of happiness at the end. This is one of those big family stories where everybody's in everybody's business because they care so much. For me, it was suspenseful and left me with a nice feel good feeling. I highly recommend it.

Originally opened by their mother Lovie, vacationers make a point of stopping for their fresh seafood. Sam is worried about the new d\u00e9cor even as thoughts turn to her son who is recovering from an ATV accident that has left him in a wheelchair. Faith has her own share of problems and Jackie is too wrapped up in herself to notice her world is crumbling around her. They are all worried about their mother who has been behaving oddly. Farley easily allows the reader to slip in as we get to know this realistic family. \n   Second date: I love that these sisters are far from perfect and Farley begins peeling back their layers and exposing their secrets. Sam\u2019s marriage is far from a fairytale story; her husband is out of work and drinking. As things spiral out of control, she must lean on her siblings for help. Jackie\u2019s world begins to crumble and she is ready to place all the blame on her husband. Sam is barely holding it together. She is the glue of the family, the strong one and the stress is beginning to show. Meanwhile Lovie is franticly trying to discover what the old key around her neck unlocks. There is a lot happening with the sisters and Farley does a good job of allowing us to view events as they unfold. At times, each of the sisters made me angry and I cringed at their interactions. Why is it that we sometimes treat the ones we love the worst? Tension begins to build as Faith\u2019s problems place them all in danger and Jackie discovers what really matters. Secondary characters offer support, shed light and added interest to the story. We see the begins of romance, but this novel focuses on the siblings themselves, \n   Third date: My last date had me flipping the pages, revelations; personal discovery and danger have me caught up. All of the threads come together and we see resolution to many of their problems including the mystery with Lovie. It all wrapped up neatly and readers will either be thrilled or feel it was too convenient. Nevertheless, I was happy to see closure and appreciate the growth each character experienced and the strengthening of family. \n   Copy provided by author.

Personally, I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying Ashley Farley's yet on the same plane as these two fabulous authors, nevertheless she did a good job telling a compelling story.Jackie, Samantha and Faith are three sisters, ranging in age from fifty to forty-two. All three have their fair share of struggles; Sam, the middle sister manages Captain Sweeney, a seafood market her parents started in 1959. Her eighteen year old son, Jamie, is in a wheelchair after an ATV accident and has lost the will to live. Faith the younger sister, finally decides to leave her abusive no-good biker (unemployed) husband, not willing to risk her young daughter\u2019s life. Faith also works at the now renovated seafood market as the bookkeeper. Finally, there\u2019s Jackie, the oldest; she\u2019s a more high maintenance woman, used to certain lifestyle and married to Bill, a heart surgeon, who apparently has no qualms cheating on his wife. Jackie is definitely the most selfish one: while Samantha and Faith try to care for their elderly mother, who seems to go a bit demented from time to time, Jackie only thinks about her own little crumbling world.I thoroughly enjoyed the authentic family dynamics. The dialogues rang fairly true. And while not everything was all rosy and resolved, the book ends on a positive note for all the sisters, being able to move on with their lives, professionally and personally. I will surely pick up the next Sweeney sisters book \u201cLow country Stranger\u201d. ***3,75***"}, {"userName": "DJ Sakata", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18344018-dj-sakata", "userReview": "Favorite Quotes:\u201cShe looks like a starving homeless woman digging through a dumpster for a leftover donut.\u201d\u201cHe was a great big man, large in size and spirit.\u201d\u201cThe image of her mother chasing after Curtis with a frying pan brought a smile to her face, even though she knew Lovie was crazy enough to try it.\u201dMy Review:Her Sister\u2019s Shoes was a delightful surprise to me, it was more serious and drama filled than I had expected, but I adored every turn and moody twist to the story. Written from three different POVs of challenged and vastly different sisters, the narrative was easy to follow and far more interesting and entertaining than a first person perspective ever could have been. I enjoyed living in each of their heads in turn, and although I initially had a difficult time appreciating the eldest sister as she was a petty, angry, shallow, vile, snide, and selfish harpy (come now - we all have at least one in our families) - I found I also savored being in her head as well and reveled in her brief glints of insight that seemed to prick her conscience and cause her discomfort.

When an ATV accident leaves her teenage son in a wheelchair, she loses her carefully constructed self-control.In the after-gloom of her dreaded fiftieth birthday and the discovery of her husband\u2019s infidelity, Jackie realizes she must reconnect with her former self to find the happiness she needs to move forward.Faith lacks the courage to stand up to her abusive husband. She turns to her sisters for help, placing all their lives at risk.In the midst of their individual challenges, the Sweeney sisters must cope with their mother\u2019s mental decline. Is Lovie in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, or is her odd behavior normal for a woman her age? No one, including Lovie, understands her obsession with a rusty key she wears around her neck.For fans of Elin Hildebrand, Her Sister\u2019s Shoes is a contemporary women\u2019s novel that explores and proves the healing power of family.My Review:Deep in the heart of South Carolina, three sisters struggle with the reality they were dealt. Each trying to grasp the meaning of it all.Samantha's son is combined to a wheelchair, due to an ATV accident. Each day he struggles to find his use in life, each day looks grimmer and grimmer. Samantha watches as her son seems to slowly fall into depression, with nothing she can do about it.Jacqueline has a easy life, one with no worries, or so she thought, until she learned of her husband's affair. With everything seeming to fall apart, Jackie must figure out where she stands.Faith gives a picture perfect smile each time she sees her sisters, but behind that smile, she is falling apart at the seams, crying out in fear. With her husband beating her at home, she fears that she and her daughter will never get away.Each sister fights to see the light, but when they are all threatened, they must confide in one another to fight the opposing threat.Ashley Farley is an amazing writer. I really enjoyed Her Sister's Shoes. It had an amazing blend of romance and mystery.

It's a very close family that were all born and raised in the same little town of Prospect. Which is a great vacation town during the summer. Their father was a fisherman and their mother, lovie started a little business across the docks to sell the fresh sea food he would bring in. The business was doing so well that they bought a prime piece of property right next to some of the best beaches and vacation spots in the area and opened up a little fish market. The girls all helped out with the business while growing up. Two of the sisters still work there, Sam who is the middle sister, pretty much calls the shots since their mom is getting up in years and is suffering from health problems. Even though Lovie is getting up there in age, she never misses a day. Sam is very protective of her family and loyal to a fault.Faith, the youngest by many years works there to do the bookkeeping and also help out as needed. She is trying to raise her young daughter and make things work with her abusive, deadbeat husband. Jackie, the oldest is married to a prominent cardiologist in town and wants to get as far away from the little market as she can. She is an interior designer that works for an elite firm in town. Jackie did help Sam with the renovations to bring the little market up to the current trends. They needed more space so they could branch out a bit more and make more of a profit. But like any business there are highs and lows. This novel is full of southern charm you can tell Ms. Farley knows her way around the south, it shows in the description of the area and the characters southern personalities as well as a few prickly pears that seem to be everywhere. That's what makes this such a great read, the characters seem to come alive off the page.  I loved it, it's full of typical and so typical family drama that makes it very interesting. I think the title of the novel is very fitting."}, {"userName": "Katherine P", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4738744-katherine-p", "userReview": "I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one as while I do like books about sisters there's a lot going on here. While it did take me a chapter or two to fall into the story once I did I was hooked and by the halfway point this earned a 2AM finish as I had to find out how it all ended! The sisters have real trouble between their personal lives, their business and their mother and they could definitely use a little down time. I really connected with Sam who is trying her hardest especially when it comes to her son and just doesn't know what to do anymore. I also really liked Faith and Bitsy though I did want to just reach in and make her go on tell Sam the truth. Jackie is a little harder to like but every once in awhile just as I was about to write her off I'd get a glimmer of hope and not give up on her quite yet.While this book is a light read it does tackle some very serious issues - domestic violence, infidelity, disabilities, depression, addiction, and dealing with a parent who may be developing Alzheimers. None of these topics felt trivialized but at the same time it kept the summer reading feel.

Jackie, Sam and Faith all still live in their coastal Carolina town, two of them working for the family fish market business and the other in high-end design.The matriarch of the family, Lovey, is still working hard although we see the sisters have some concerns about their aging mother. On top of this each sister is dealing with their own set of issues. Jackie the oldest is having marriage issues. Sam is working with her son who is in a wheelchair after an accident that killed his best friend. Faith is dealing with a dirtbag of a husband. The sisters are also doing a renovation of the family business and hope the locals take to it. All of their personal problems, issues with the business, their mother\u2019s declining mental state and tension with each other are worked through in this wonderful family based book.Jackie is the eldest sister. She comes off as what one might say a GIANT bitch. She is icy, stuck up, selfish, preoccupied and can\u2019t see her own faults. It is safe to say she wasn\u2019t my favorite. For about 80% of the book she was working her way onto my least favorite characters list. But thank the lord she had some sense knocked into her and BOOM character growth.Sam is the middle sister. She is the glue in this trio \u2013 the strong one, problem solver. She runs the family business, looks after her mother quite a bit and is taking care of her college-aged son who is in a wheelchair but trying to learn to walk again. It is clear that she has too much going on and it eventually catches up to her. We also get treated to a little romance with Sam, which is very sweet. Sam is one of those characters I think is really easy to like. She is always putting others first and wants the best for everyone.Faith is the youngest. She has a young daughter and a disgusting husband. He is out of work, drinks too much and has sleazy friends. WINNER. Things get out of hand between the two and Faith finds herself leaning on Sam. From the beginning, you can tell Faith is the baby. She is quieter and definitely defers to her sisters, as well as other people in general.On of my favorite plots in the book revolved around Sam and her son Jamie. Jamie was in a bad place after his accident where he lost his best friend and his own ability to walk. He was blaming himself and was having a hard time moving on. I just loved to watch Sam be there for her son in every possible way even as she failed. Maybe its being a mom now, but I was just so emotional about their interactions and her feelings about her son and her parenting abilities. I think it was done very well.Also, we got treated to Lovey, the sisters mother. She and her husband worked hard to start their business and she continues to work hard as she gets older. When the renovations are going on it is the first time she isn\u2019t working and this definitely takes a toll on her. Without her routine she loses a little of her mental capabilities. It is really sad but does cause fo a few humorous moments as well.My only complaint is that there is just so much drama going on in this family and it just gets tied up so perfectly it is a little unbelievable. This didn\u2019t really impact my enjoyment of the book though. I was just like really??I love me a story centering on family and this did just that. While there was a little bit of romance, it was a side plot that didn\u2019t take over the story. It delved into a lot of topics between the sisters and I think they were all done fairly well. This was a really easy, quick read that was super enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745176-maria", "userReview": "I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher as a part of a book tour for a fair and honest review and rated it 5 out of 5 Stars and a Recommended Read.A fan of books set in South Carolina\u2019s Low Country, I looked forward to reading Her Sister\u2019s Shoes by Ashley Farley and was thrilled to discover what I consider to be a literary treasure. What begins as a book about three sisters, their family business and their very different lives turns into a raw, honest look at what makes, breaks and brings together a modern American family. Filled with colorful characters, good dialogue, plenty of southern charm and color, this is a book any lover of women\u2019s fiction will want to pick up. Ms. Farley does a wonderful job developing the primary characters in this book; I easily connected with Jackie, Samantha \u201cSam\u201d, and Faith, the three Sweeney sisters, as they try to balance their individual lives, hopes and families. While the three women share some similarities due to their familial bond, it\u2019s clear from the beginning that their personalities are very different and that in a way this summer, life has dealt all three of them a difficult hand. A situation they all had a hand in making. While I myself am the oldest of four daughters, I found myself connecting more with \u201cSam\u201d than with Jackie, the oldest daughter. Sam is daughter that is the most like her father and is definitely the glue that holds the family together as they go through this difficult time.As each of the women deal with their personal issues; Jackie\u2019s failing marriage, Sam\u2019s son \u201cJamie\u201d who is suffering from grief and survivor\u2019s guilt due to a friend\u2019s death, and Faith\u2019s drunk, lazy, good for nothing husband who is becoming more dangerous for her and their daughter, they are forced to deal with their family\u2019s seafood business and mother\u2019s health concerns. I loved how Sam and Faith, and even Jackie to an extent, were so involved with their mother. They may not always have agreed on what needed to be done but they were clearly devoted to their families.Ms. Farley also does a good job with the secondary characters; I especially enjoyed getting to know the three women\u2019s children, Cooper, Sean, Jamie and \u201cBitsy\u201d and their mom, Lovie. While I didn\u2019t admire Jackie\u2019s husband, Bill, I did understand what drove a wedge in their marriage. I completely hated Faith\u2019s husband, Curtis, and kept hoping that he would disappear. The remaining secondary characters, from the women\u2019s friends and people in town were also well written and added plenty of color, emotional angst and depth to the story.Ms. Farley\u2019s writing was a joy to read. Her voice as a writer is rich, warm and very easy to follow. I found myself completely immersed in the world she created for her characters and in the characters themselves. The story\u2019s pace is moderate and enjoyable and as a reader I found myself completely engaged in what was taking place on the page. Ms. Farley\u2019s development of her characters emotions is well done and feels very genuine. Her descriptions of life in the little town of Prospect, in the Low Country, is vivid and detailed, which helped me feel as if I was actually there.Will the Sweeney sisters be able to figure out what is going on with their mother\u2019s health before it\u2019s too late? Will they be able to help each other through the rough summer and be stronger for the challenges they face? You\u2019ll have to read Her Sister\u2019s Shoes to find out, I loved it and gladly highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Lelia Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6089004-lelia-taylor", "userReview": "Southern fiction is one of my very favorite genres and I was delighted to have the opportunity to read and review Her Sister's Shoes which can also be considered women's fiction although I really dislike that term. What could be called \"men's fiction\" is more likely to be known as action-adventure or the like. Back in 2012, David Granger, the editor of Esquire described men's fiction as:\u201c...plot-driven and exciting, where one thing happens after another...and also at the same time, dealing with passages in a man\u2019s life that seem common.\u201dTo which author Jami Attenberg replied:\"It\u2019s a good thing we lady writers are busy writing books that are boring, and where nothing happens. We wouldn\u2019t want too much excitement. We might faint dramatically. We might have to take to our beds for weeks on end. We are delicate things, we lady writers.Did you hear me? I said we might fucking faint.\"There are, of course, men also writing so-called women's fiction but it frequently gets labeled as general fiction. So, I choose to refer to Her Sister's Shoes as Southern fiction and just stay away from that whole squabble ;-)Chief among the many good things I found in this book are strong characterizations of the three sisters but also of the secondary players. This was not a surprise to me as I had already recognized Ms. Farley's ability to create well-drawn characters in her first book, Saving Ben. Each sister has her own set of crosses to bear and her own personality---Sam feels the need to be everybody's rock, Jackie has an inferiority complex that she tries to hide behind money and image and Faith is timid and exploited and feeling trapped.How these women deal with their issues individually but also as family is what lies at the core of the story and is a nice example of the strengths that one can derive from family, whether it be by blood or a different kind of family. By telling the tale through each sister's point of view, I felt close to each and gained a real understanding of what these women were all about and how their environs helped to shape them as they grew into adulthood. Much the same can be said for the older and younger generations and I would love to return to the small Lowcountry town of Prospect to see what happens with these very appealing people."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5693323-cheryl", "userReview": "This was one of those \"can't put it down\" books\". I started it at 10pm last night, I had to put it down at midnight to get some sleep since I am recuperating from pneumonia. I was up again a 4:30 for a breathing treatment and finished the book at 8am. Yeah, that's 7 1/2 hours of a wild ride. Sounds wrong to be thankful for being sick enough to have the time to read. But I am on the mend. Being the oldest of three sisters may have helped me get into this book but the dynamics were so strong that I didn't realize my relationship to the story until I finished. I can understand the friction and misunderstandings between the sisters now. The sisters are so different from each other as happens often with siblings. I have three sons who have very different personalities but they are close in age and want to be together a lot even though they are all in their 40s. I mention that because I wonder if sisters have a harder time getting along. This book explores the lives of three women whose characters are brought to life, real gritty life, by this very talented author and her brilliant editors. Thank you Ashley Farley and I look forward to book two in the series. I just want to savor what I so recently experienced first."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1735763-laura", "userReview": "I was anxious to dig into a good Southern women's fiction novel and reading Her Sister's Shoes did not disappoint. It transported me to a coastal South Carolina town and into the lives of the Sweeney Sisters. I come from a family where we are three sisters, so I was able to appreciate the nuances and the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship of these sisters.The Sweeney sisters are three very different women, each with their own set of issues. Farley deftly creates each character by giving each woman her own distinct voice and her own chapters, so we get to know them well. In addition, their mother is experiencing dementia and they are faced with how to deal with this situation. I loved how well Farley interwove their lives seamlessly and built a good plot line around their struggles. Each woman had to learn to overcome great emotional obstacles\u2014an injured and emotionally broken teenage child, an abusive spouse, infidelity in a marriage.I loved the setting too. I could hear the seagulls along the wharf, smell the fish the fishermen hauled after a day out in the ocean and see the water sparkling at twilight. Farley vividly portrayed the life of a family whose business was seafood. It brought back memories of my trip to South Carolina as well as the Maritimes. It was a perfect summer read.Her Sister's Shoes is a heartwarming, well-written story about how families can work together to support and help each other through both the good and bad times. It made me wonder how I would have dealt with the situations these women faced. It's never too late to make changes in one's life. Courage has many faces. Family bonds and relationships, including those of children can be a motivating and strong force for good. These are some of the themes explored in this novel.I am Ashley Farley's newest fan and look forward to reading more of her works."}, {"userName": "Leslie aka StoreyBook Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272944-leslie-aka-storeybook-reviews", "userReview": "I LOVED this book! It was hard for me to put down because I wanted to know what happened next with any of the sisters or their mother. The sisters had a lot to deal with in their lives from abuse to a mid-life crisis to alcoholism to dementia. I thought that each sister found her strength in different ways and sometimes it took intervention from the rest of the family to make sure they didn't totally fall apart. Plus there was their mother, Lovie, who is showing the early signs of dementia/Alzheimers and is obsessed with a rusty key. She knows it goes to something important but can't remember what. Watching how the sisters dealt with this reminded me of my father and his battle with dementia.There is a little bit of suspense in this book, mostly dealing with Faith's abuse issues from her husband and not knowing if he is going to go completely off the rails and harm anyone. And of course the mystery of what the key unlocks for Lovie. There is some romance, especially for Samantha, who has not really been involved with anyone since her son's father left them when he found out she was pregnant some 15+ years ago.Jackie may be the oldest sister but I thought that she was a bit spoiled. That is probably because while the family grew up somewhat poor or middle class, she wanted to be rich and respected because of money and not who she really was deep down. Jackie learns a lot about herself and what she is capable of at a turning point in her life, turning 50.And of course you have the small town feel which brings along the small town \"politics\" and those that they think own the town and can do whatever they want to anyone they want. The sisters deal with this in their own way and survive the small mindedness of some townspeople.I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Jen La Duca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13206527-jen-la-duca", "userReview": "Beautifully written, Her Sister\u2019s Shoes is an intensely powerful book that will stay with me for quite some time. Sister\u2019s Jackie, Faith and Sam have each been through their fair share of problems and crisis throughout their lives; one is being abused by her husband, one has a husband who\u2019s cheating on her and the last sister is dealing with the aftermath of her son\u2019s tragic accident which left him in a wheelchair. As if all that weren't enough, their mother seems to be suffering some form of early onset Dementia. In the throes of the problems that each sister faces, they never give up. Instead they help each other to overcome what is needed in their lives and end up growing closer together in the process. Farley does an outstanding job giving each sister her own, distinct voice as the chapters alternate between their lives.This is a wonderful book that I enjoyed very much! Her Sister's Shoes would be an excellent recommendation for fans of women\u2019s fiction and/or family dramas. It's the type of story that has a little something for everyone, making it relatable to almost everyone. This would also make a wonderful Book Club choice as there\u2019s so much to discuss including siblings, family, love and loss.A huge thank you to author, Ashley Farley and to TLC Book Tours for inviting me to participate in the blog tour and for providing me with a complimentary, paperback copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

But I think the main reason I enjoyed it so is that it's just a great book! It had me hooked from the very beginning!Three very different sisters are experiencing their own individual crisis. Without giving too much away, the book deals with unfaithfulness, abusiveness, dementia, and a teenager involved in a crippling ATV accident. Among all the very real problems, however, there is a lovely story of genuine family values and relationships that will keep you turning the pages.At the beginning of each chapter, an illustration of a shoe identifies a particular sister.
