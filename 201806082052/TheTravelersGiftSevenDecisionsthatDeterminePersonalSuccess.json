I only give them to what I think are the worst books, the books in which I can say afterwards that they were a waste of my precious time and I wish I had those moments of life back. This book I feel is worth that one star rating. This is a pop psychology self help book with a religious undertone. As is popular with self help material, the author broke his work into a list. Surprisingly, he did not create an acronym to describe the ideas as well.For each aspect to make yourself into a better you, he had some random shlub timetravel to meet various famous people just as they are about to conduct something which had made them famous. Now I am not going to dispute the author's history. Yes, Christopher Columbus sailed west in 1492. Yes, Truman ordered the bomb to be dropped in 1945. I do dispute the authors interpretations as to why many of these decisions were made. For example, he should have done more research on Copernicus and his scientific work as well as ancient Greek knowledge that was not lost during the middle ages before he wrote the part with Columbus. But while the historical aspect of the book played a major roll, it was merely a prop for the author to push his seven concepts, each of which was written out by the historical figures in a rambling and repetitive way that made it difficult for me not to nod off during those parts of the book. I would like to also point out that one of his points he pushed is to associate yourself with quality people. He also pushed religion throughout the book. So it is too bad Jesus did not know about these seven rules to a successful life. After all, he hung out with lepers, tax collectors and prostitutes rather than shun them because of their low status. Now I am off to join the Flat Earth Society. I will be determined to stick to my decision because I am too ignorant to know what is wrong. I will be persistent on joining them. I will do it today so I will not procrastinate. I will smile and be happy while I do it. And I will live with the consequences of my decision because the buck stops here."}, {"userName": "M.M.

As most of you know, I almost always write about a mystery in my blog posts. But this week's book was a little different, and it might be something of interest to you if you need a little pick-me-up in your life. :-)The Traveler's Gift by Andy Andrews is a wonderful fiction book about a forty-something-year-old man named David Ponder who's a bit down-and-out on his luck. He lost his job, his daughter needs her tonsils out, the mortgage is behind, and things just kinda s*ck in general. So just as he's ready to give up on life (think It's A Wonderful Life) he's given an amazing opportunity to visit some key people in history in order to learn a lesson from each of them. In order of the people he meets, they are as follows:Harry Truman ~ David learns \"The buck stops here\"King Soloman ~ David learns \"I will seek wisdom\"Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain ~ David learns \"I am a person of action\"Christopher Columbus ~ David learns \"I have a decided heart\"Anne Frank ~ David learns \"Today I will choose to be happy\"Abraham Lincoln ~ David learns \"I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit\"The Angel Gabriel ~ David learns \"I will persist without exception\"Does it go without saying that David's life undergoes a dramatic turn-around after having the amazing experience of meeting seven such influential people in history? Probably. So if you personally ever need a boost to your self-esteem--or maybe just a little kick in the pants--then this book is a really motivational read. It makes you realize how lucky we all are to have this shot at life and that we really are the driver's of our own destiny.So, like I wrote earlier--this book was not my \"typical\" read, but sometimes it's nice to try something new. And if you give this story a chance, I promise you'll shut it with a smile on your face and some determination in your heart. 'Til next week, happy reading my friends!"}, {"userName": "Chris Vonada", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13509950-chris-vonada", "userReview": "The first Andy Andrews book that I picked up was The Traveler\u2019s Gift, and it was as if God himself handed it to me, one of those \u201cperfect books at just the perfect time.\u201dIt\u2019 s funny how things unfold according to God\u2019s plan.

I mean choosing to be happy, to accept responsibility for your decisions, to forgive others, etc, etc, etc. - it's all good advice, that when correctly applied could certainly help you become more successful. That being said, I canNOT believe how self-important this author is! The last guide he meets with tells the main character, \"You have been given a gift that has the power to change your civilization,\" and, \"Our Creator has granted you the extraordinary power of the wisdom contained in the Seven Decisions.\" Really? These particular tips will change all of civilization? Wow; I've heard of some authors who said their books could change mankind, but I've never read that belief printed so blatantly in their own creations. And I'm pretty sure I've heard all the advice from better writers at some time or another, so presented here, they didn't strike me with their \"extraordinary\" import. And that's another problem: this book is not very well-written. It's a little choppy and rreally contrived. So, my recommendation is: read the tips (a list is handily supplied on p. 204 or even in other reviews), but as for the rest; take it or leave it."}, {"userName": "Shauna", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2176113-shauna", "userReview": "Nothing groundbreaking, no new news here. Boring, hokey, overwrought...seven steps most of us have learned by our early teens. Yes, there are historical inaccuracies, but that is the least of this books' problems. The set up for the story reads as if a high school english teacher asked his students to write the saddest thing they could ever think of, and then make it sadder, just, pile it on. The historic characters are so free from fault, it is difficult to draw inspiration from them. Personally, I find that knowing the great personas from our past were actually flawed individuals who were just doing the best they could in their particular circumstances much more attainable role models than this drivel. Spoiler! In the end the main character attains the heights of popularity and wealth, and it seems that the author deems that the ultimate goal. How is anyone else supposed to live up to that? Would have been nice to see him be successful as an average Joe, holding down a good job, caring for his family, taking pleasure in the little things...but no, he must become Donald Trump and Jesus rolled into one.

Well-done Andy Andrews!!The story of David is so compelling. Andrews has a pretty nice writing style too, and I love the creativity here, meeting the figures from history and learning from their wisdom, but in a way that was truly inspiring. I blog in the self-development and motivational space and I get a lot of readers that just think this \"inspiration\" and \"positive thinking\" 'stuff' is not for them.... and they are simply wrong. They CHOOSE to believe they have no power, no will, no choice, and I love the no-nonsense way that Andrews clears that up!I took out a highlighter and marked several several passages, and my favorite was probably the episode with little Anne Frank.

He was surprisingly funny, but had some very poignant insights into business and life. I decided to get some of his books after hearing him speak because I had learned so many things from him.This book was great. It sucked me in right from the start. Profiling a man who lost everything he'd put into a career, his low income and low self esteem spill over into his home life and begin affecting his marriage and relationship with his daughter. Broken in every sense of the word, he finds himself embarking on a sudden and unexpected journey that teaches him the very powerful life lessons, or more specifically, the seven decisions he will need to make to have success in this life and turn EVERYTHING around. Without wanting to give everything away, there are inspirational heroes who share with him the very decisions he will need to make. A parable, of sorts, that any reader could relate to, and adopt these seven decisions for ourselves.Each \"decision\" has a definite code for living at the end of the chapters, an easy to read sum up of the attitude or philosophy required to adopt this decision. The heroes profiled are inspirational, and I had chills many times as I read along. I enjoyed this book very much.Early in the book, there is a suggestion to read the \"decisions\" twice daily to adopt them into the heart, commit them to memory, and to be in a position to share them with others. I will definitely be adding them to my daily routine of affirmations and review of my goals because they are such powerful, life changing statements."}, {"userName": "Peregrine 12", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4597960-peregrine-12", "userReview": "This book was one of the worst things in print I've ever seen. Three problems:1. Main character is 2-D. False and unbelievable. Just a prop to get us into the author's story.2. Author references history - but his facts are WRONG. (Specifically: Truman's apparent reluctance to drop the H-bomb on Japan; history shows that not only did he do it willingly, but he refused to NOT do it when Japan tried to surrender! This incident in the story supports the nice, convenient view that every American leader is always the reluctant hero.)3. I personally didn't appreciate the Christian-Conservative moral overtones at the end. (Seriously - do we need to describe Saddam Hussein as on the same level as Hitler? Does the author think we're completely stupid, with no sense of history? Well, apparently, he does.)What's good: it was fun to think about meeting the historical figures presented in this book.

It is up to us to decide to embrace our calling or continue running from it while encountering all the obstacles on our own without the road map.

I have a feeling he\u2019s a better speaker than he is a fiction writer and that he would have done better writing in his \u201cnatural\u201d voice. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the 7 principals themselves are fine. Nobody can deny that being an active participant in your own life is powerful or that surrounding yourself with positive vs. negative influences is a good thing. However, the message of the book got to be a little repetitive towards the end and started to feel like I was watching a late night evangelical program on TV (more about selling something and less about Truth). I guess my biggest concern with these 7 rules is that they can quickly become something glib, self-serving, over-simplified \u2026 even dangerous. Something other people use as a way to justify their greed and as an excuse to stop having compassion for others. (Also: Christopher Columbus, really?

In an It's a Wonderful Life twist, he seeks to end his life, thinking that his family would be better off without him by collecting his insurance money. Rather than not being born, however, Ponder is transported through time, where he \"meets,\" in order, Harry Truman, Solomon, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Christopher Columbus, Anne Frank, Abraham Lincoln, and the archangel Gabriel. Each one gives him a \"decision for success\" which he is to use when he recovers from his car accident.What Andrews attempts to do, in a rather hokey but easy-to-read way, is present to his readers a seven-step plan for taking control of their lives. Slightly spiritual without getting preachy, the book's seven tips do make sense, even if Andrews' method of presenting them is a bit far-fetched. (His historical research, however, especially on Chamberlain, is very good.) But perhaps this is what some people need in this era of self-help overload--a little escapism to help them realize that their lives are something that can be managed, and they don't need $200-an-hour help to do it.

I gave it 0 stars. I enjoy reading a lot of books and honestly don't have a very high standard. Even if a book is unintelligent I can still enjoy a good page turning plot. If the plot is slow I can still relish in thought provoking ideas and thematic exploration. This book has neither a compelling plot or an intelligent premise. The plot is terrifyingly laughable especially given that the author uses it to wallow in self-aggrandizement. Likewise, the themes are stagnant and the writing is awful.This book is about a floundering man who is chosen by a God figure to learn some lessons and then returns to reality/earth to save mankind by imparting (as a motivational speaker) all the wisdom he learned. Stadiums full of people reverence him. Parks and hospitals are named after him and his family. Of course, he is fabulously wealthy. The mere mention of his name brings people to tears and testimonials. Now having said that, it is important to note that the author is a motivational speaker. The author turned himself into a hero. He makes himself God's gift to mankind...literally! This book makes me sad for all the wrong reasons.Sure, you can say: \"but what does that matter compared to all that you learn from the seven gifts\". Well, there are certainly some nice ideas. Not new ideas, just nice ideas. These nice ideas are truly the only redeeming quality of the book. It is just too bad that none of these ideas are unique.Beyond that concession I find no other. Through the course of the man's journey he meets several key figures from a variety of times and places. Yet, each of their voices are identical. No variety. No imagination. Amazingly, they all sounded exactly like the motivational speaker. Far more disconcerting are the blatant historical inaccuracies. I always figured that an author would want to research their ideas so that the text would not expose them as an ignoramus. Not this motivational speaker. He is just fine knowing that anyone who reads his book can see him trying to pass off creative story telling as truth. Worse still are the cliches.
