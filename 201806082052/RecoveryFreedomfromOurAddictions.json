Actually, I was surprised by just how disarming his honesty was in the book, the level of brutal self-reflection he achieves in his writing here, and clearly in his path to coping with various addictions, was both moving and inspiring. It's not easy taking a long hard look at yourself, at the choices that you've made and the inner workings of your mind; and not just looking but seeing what and why and how and then maybe, just maybe, having the strength and courage to change yourself. Now i'm not even close to having the same issues he has, but that's the point of this book. Addiction is not always about drugs or alcohol or other serious life-threatening affairs, it's about any behaviour we've lost control over, where the response of our unconscious mind takes over, like when I have a bad day and reach for an entire bag of cookies to 'make myself feel better'. Does it? Maybe for 5 mins, before I feel sick and fat and like a failure for once again being so damn stupid. It's pretty recognisable behaviour, one which runs through everyone to one degree or another. We are all looking for ways to feel better or cope or block things out or lose the fear so we can connect with others. Whatever the reason, Brand is saying that there are better ways to do it, ones which we have control over and which don't harm us physically, mentally, spiritually, or in any other way an addiction might. Because he's who he is, all of this is done is simple, amusing, and straight forward language. He titled it Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions. I would call it Recovery: Lose all the Bullshit. There's a clear plan to follow, 12 well worn steps that have worked the world over. That's not to say it would be easy to go this route, getting to the end of this path would mean dealing with some issues not everyone might be ready to face about themselves, but at least now they might be able to see how it could be approached and where to go for help. It's a starting point.This is a really good book about helping yourself for those that hate all that airy fairy self-help rubbish. Recommended."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7182738-mel", "userReview": "There is a little anecdote in the book where Brand is speaking with a counselor, a grueling session that has gone on and detailed the darkest parts of his life and the severity of his addictions. When she stops speaking she looks at him awestruck, and in that little pause, that on a sheet of paper is 2 tiny spaces, your mind reels with the thoughts that could fill pages... She simply tells him what a survivor he is to have found drugs. Think about that. 5 *'s? Sure. When an author expresses himself with such sincerity, intimacy, and intelligence -- I am inclined to feel gratitude for the shared experience. (And never has the phrase \"F*ed up* sounded so proper.) I also thought Brand's definition of addiction and how that broadened interpretation fit into our current world was significant. I bought this book (and the audio version which is narrated by Brand) to expand my understanding of addictions and recovery, and also as a reader that has experience with the subject professionally and within my family that is always looking to better understand. I've read extensively on the subject, lived with it, and worked with addicts. And I think that sadly, that has become the norm.Brand doesn't give us anything new here other than his own experience and testimony of the 12-Step program, but he does it with more insight, expanding the concept of *Higher Power* with wisdom and his own comedic touch. He applies the 12-steps to a wide variety of the obstacles that might be keeping us from being the person we are meant to be (drugs, alcohol, food, anger, selfishness, depression, etc.). Rather than just educating myself, I came away with a desire to improve myself and be a little more at peace in my environment, and a little enlightenment. Some clinicians argue against the 12 Step program concerned that a participant would only be replacing one addiction with another...I think Brand gives an eloquent argument against that opinion.Brand has walked that razor-thin edge most of his life and knows the struggle very personally. This is a more than just his story fit into a guidebook, more than just another life preserver thrown out to those sinking. Brand seems to jump in and buoy up the drowning, and I am convinced he'd do just that. It's a fervent plea to those struggling under their own destructive burdens not to give up. By sharing his detailed journey, the hidden pains and the glorious celebration of the birth of his daughter, he is convincing that it's possible to not only gain back wellness but to be embraced by a world where you are an integral part of a journey toward being F-ing magnificent. *It's Russell Brand...uncensored. It's intelligent, heartfelt, endearing, very funny, and maybe a *thank you for Life* written to the author's own Higher Power."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66542863-john", "userReview": "Fantastic...I laughed, I cried, I nearly peed myself!

It sets out the 12 Steps programme and how you apply it to your life in order for you to realise and recognise the patterns that you continually make that cause you unhappiness and how you go about re-programming your mind to avoid making them in future. Don't think that this book just applies to the well known \"serious\" addictions of alcohol, drugs, sex etc; Russell Brand argues that anyone who regularly feels anxious, not good enough, overwhelmed etc is on the addiction spectrum and can be helped by following this programme. After reading, I tend to agree and intend to re-read and follow the programme. Above anything else, what I loved most about this book was how practical it was; there was no \"if you're feeling depressed, try not to be depressed\" aspect to this book and instead exercises that enable proper self-reflection and hard work. I know following this programme isn't going to be easy but thanks to this book, I feel a real sense of hope that change is possible and that things don't have to stay as they are."}, {"userName": "Noran Azmy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12994276-noran-azmy", "userReview": "Never has the controversial genre of Self Help been graced by a more beautiful, a more eloquent, a more truthful or a more effective addition to its aisles.

I am a fan of Russell Brand. I haven't read any of his books until now. I really like how he is so honest and how he breaks down the steps w/o religion, but with an understanding that there is something at work that is larger than we are. I also bought the audio so I can listen to him on the way to school. I wish he would create a meditation CD as his voice is calming!

I really enjoyed his Revolution book from a couple of years ago.This started strong, with easy to understand, instantly engaging outlines of the 12-step as favoured by many AA type programmes. I cannot pinpoint what brought it down in rating for me, however I feel towards the end it was Brand's humour and wit that kept me engaged not the subject matter itself.

It is a slap in the face to say the least. Everything Russell talks about in this book, or program, whichever you wish to call it, makes you take a step back and look at your life. Yes, it can be tough but, and I can say this honestly, it is an eye opener. He is so open and honest and raw that you can't help but want to follow his steps and improve your own life.

Brand is very introspective and observant, a mix of orator, philosopher, sociologist and poet.

I love Russell's way with words. There were times in this book I related so much to what he was saying it was extremely emotive for me - particularly those detailing his his day to day interaction with the world and how that lead him to feel. That to me is the beauty of reading when you can relate so heavily to the author. And Russell does not hold back on the truth or his own vulnerability which makes this extremely captivating. I do not consider myself an addict, but I had read many reviews stating theres also much to be gleaned for 'none-addicts' so I approached it with all the opened mindedness I could - however the reason I don't award this book more than 3 stars is that .. I feel in places that the language is very dangerous. And if you are susceptible to mental illness or just negative thinking in general it can be very disillusioning. Asking questions such as do you feel anxious or depressed or struggling with relationships, emotions, lacking purpose and drive. Well then your plan is not working and you are clearly unable to help yourself and the only hope for you is to adopt this plan and be open to spirituality and believe in a higher power - but you need a mentor and a 12 step group for this. The book doesn't provide a mentor or a 12 step group, if you are a 'none addict' reading this there is unlikely to be any 12 step groups focused at your particular problem unless you live in a large city. I live in a small northern town. This at times made me feel extremely empty and hopeless. Which is what Russell wants you to believe you are so that you want to carry on with the 12 steps. But the 12 steps are not for everyone. And I don't believe feeling occasionally anxious and or depressed and or struggling with relationships or lack of direction means that you are completely 'fucked' and you have no resources or plans to get you out of this other than the 12 steps, I think that it just makes you human. This is a book that because of this was a difficult read for me and made me feel horrendous for a number of days and that I hadn't really progressed on my mental health journey - but I had. I just think its very dangerous to get readers to believe they are 'fucked' and there is no hope in order to pitch them the 12 steps which isn't ideal for everyone. I can see how this would be great for addicts higher on the addiction spectrum however. The book has some fascinating ideas but can make you feel helpless. I however on the whole did enjoy this book and loved Russell's writing and was happy to read in its entirety."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21144070-renee", "userReview": "**Listened again and upgraded rating from 4 to 5 stars**As a person in recovery who did not use a 12-step program for support, I have always thought that 12-step programs were a little too prescriptive and dogmatic to be of use to me.

A few months ago my mum told me about this podcast she had started listening to called 'Under the Skin' created and hosted by Russell Brand. I was intrigued by the things she told me about it and so started listening and was captivated by the guests he had on, the topics they discussed and the incredibly honest and vulnerable way he shared parts of his own story. Fast forward a few months and from listening to his podcast I learnt about Russell Brand's newest book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions.This book has that raw authenticity and truth that I love about the podcast. His openness to new ideas and to self-growth. This book takes Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-step program (something I'd not heard of before starting this book) and adds Russell Brands honest, comedic twist to it. His writing is sometimes magically whimsical and sometimes dark and gritty. He shares some of his own experiences with the twelve-step program and puts it into new wording. You don't have to be dealing with a specific addiction to get things from this book. There's a lot in here, all fascinating and thoughtful and anyone interested in self-growth or who may be feeling anxious or dissatisfied with life would benefit from giving this a try. I loved the parts about your own higher power (without the need for organised religion) and the importance of believing change is possible. Practical steps to help you release your need for control and self-absorption. The audiobook narrated by Russell Brand himself was fantastic and I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a new perspective or a way to get more out of life."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3658724-amy", "userReview": "Thanks for the generous help, Russell!"}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51067866-jay", "userReview": "I never thought i\u2019d read a book penned by Russell Brand, and yet here I am. My understanding of Brand has mostly come from the tabloids: I\u2019m familiar with his past dependency on narcotics, his ill-fated marriage to Katy Perry, his Hollywood films. But I hadn\u2019t heard about him in some time. He\u2019d dropped off my radar. And then, out of seemingly nowhere, I heard news of the impending release of this book.My interest in reading it was two-fold: yes i was curious because he is a well-known figure, but on its own, that isn\u2019t enough to draw me in. Primarily, it was the subject matter that was the key factor. Now I won\u2019t falsely purport to have an alcohol or narcotic addiction. But I have experienced other vices, namely internet addiction and compulsive overeating. And having dealt with anxiety and depression, I do look for new ways in which to frame my mental health, new techniques to help me cope with my intervals of low mood. But also, knowing people who have had varying addictions and patterns of negative thinking, I try to find ways to give support and counsel to people close to me. The book was, admittedly, a bit too spiritual for me, but in saying that, I completely understand why it had to be. Appealing to a higher being can be helpful. All too often people try to fall back on their own resources to pull them through, maybe out of pride or fear of being a burden. But relying on yourself more often than not leads you back to self-medication. So the idea that you don\u2019t have to shoulder it all on your own, that there is a program in existence that has proven to work, is obviously very alleviating. It\u2019s just that for atheists like me, the higher being thing just might be a tad too evangelical. In the book\u2019s technical aspects, it is well written - a surprise to me as I didn\u2019t know Brand was an accomplished writer. If anything, it is at times over written to disguise the fact that it gets repetitive as it goes along. There is one theme - recovery - and while the structure (the 12 step program) ensures that this theme follows a trajectory, the analysis starts to feel shallow, and dare I say it, a bit prescriptive, after a while. You can skip passages and you won\u2019t really lose out on much. Through it all I couldn\u2019t quite forget that Brand is speaking from a point of privilege. Sure he was once at rock bottom, but he recovered and flourished. Could he have recovered half as well if he didn\u2019t acquire wealth and fame? Or does he enjoy these things because he has recovered? It is difficult to separate the two. But it is definitely an area worth exploring. As critical as I am, I still think this book has a lot of merit. It reminded me that life is infinitely better with the support and vindication of people around you, that recovery is futile without crossing the bridge to human connection. It\u2019s important for people to remember that you can\u2019t shoulder the burden of your mental health alone. This doesn\u2019t mean that you find someone who can enable and abet you. But that you find resources, services, programs, support groups and, yes, maybe spirituality (meditation and mindfulness are proven therapeutic tools) to guide you through. In that regard, the book is on point."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33270467-jennifer", "userReview": "I don\u2019t have one of the more obvious addictions that everyone thinks of, but I still think this book is life changing.

I listened to (and would recommend) the audio version because Russell speaks well, and writes in a conversational style.

Brand speaks to those suffering along the full spectrum of addiction--from drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar addictions to addictions to work, stress, bad relationships, digital media, and fame. Brand understands that addiction can take many shapes and sizes and how the process of staying clean, sane, and unhooked is a daily activity. He believes that the question is not -Why are you addicted?- but -What pain is your addiction masking? Why are you running--into the wrong job, the wrong life, the wrong person's arms?-Russell has been in all the twelve-step fellowships going, he's started his own men's group, he's a therapy regular and a practiced yogi--and while he's worked on this material as part of his comedy and previous bestsellers, he's never before shared the tools that really took him out of it, that keep him clean and clear.
